produzione delle proteine microarray dna sono utilizzati per le analisi dei geni e dei loro mrna mentre microarray proteici sono impiegati per lanalisi della produzione delle proteine e per capirne la funzione anticorpi secondari marcati metodi classici di rilevazione includono fluorescenza chemiluminescenza e colorimetria sistemi di microarray planari sono perfettamente adatti per generare microarray proteici ad alta intensità che possono esaminare un gran numero di analiti un singolo esperimento gli array biglie forniscono unalternativa interessante ai microarray planari specialmente

passato rassegna il loro impiego nella diagnostica vitro e discussi possibili impieghi nel campo della medicina personalizzata le tradizionali tecnologie per lanalisi di dna mrna e proteine possono analizzare solo un parametro alla volta e pertanto hanno una produttività limitata quando è necessario valutare un grande numero di parametri limplementazione dei microarray dna e proteine ha portato unimpressionante accelerazione nella scoperta di nuovi biomarcatori con il fine ultimo di identificarne un numero specifico per le diverse patologie e quindi di combinarli una tecnologia di screening

la serie più appropriata di biomarcatori e quindi integrarli nei servizi sanitari la figura <NUMBER> riassume le fasi per la scoperta di biomarcatori mediante microarray proteine e la conseguente possibile applicazione per una medicina personalizzata evidenze recenti provano che microarray proteine hanno un incredibile potenziale nel campo della scoperta dei biomarcatori gli rppm sono stati

nella diagnostica clinica tuttavia la crescente lista di potenziali biomarcatori dimostra che microarray proteine possiedono un grande potenziale per contribuire allo sviluppo di terapie mediche individualizzate le conoscenze generate tramite tali microarray proteine non solo aiuteranno clinici ad adattare le terapie secondo fabbisogni individuali dei pazienti serviranno anche minimizzare il rischio di effetti avversi causati da un farmaco sbagliato da un dosaggio farmacologico inappropriato microarray proteine rendono possibile una quantificazione parallela e massiva di potenziali nuovi biomarcatori brevissimo tempo da un gran numero di campioni biologici lanalisi per cluster di questa serie di dati può quindi mettere rilievo indizi che correlano con lo stadio della malattia <NUMBER> le tre principali applicazioni dei microarray proteine per la scoperta di nuovi biomarcatori sono rappresentate dallapproccio basato sui dati sperimentali dallapproccio basato sulle conoscenze e dallapproccio basato sulla biologia dei sistemi questo approccio comporta unanalisi di tutto il proteoma per identificare una correlazione tra la concentrazione di una particolare proteina e la presenza di una specifica malattia lapproccio è assolutamente obiettivo dal momento che non vengono fatte alcune assunzioni relativamente alle proteine che possono essere coinvolte nel processo patologico questo tipo di microarray per lanalisi globale delle concentrazioni proteiche è tuttavia ancora agli esordi infatti il combinare le attuali tecniche di array con anticorpi con la strategia di marcatura diretta dei campioni permette lanalisi di un numero limitato di parametri inoltre nonostante gli sforzi fatti per lo sviluppo di anticorpi ricombinanti e le opportunità offerte dalle classiche vie di produzioni di anticorpi la disponibilità di anticorpi di elevata qualità diretti contro ogni singola proteina di interesse è ancora molto limitata <NUMBER> <NUMBER> ciononostante tecniche ad elevata produttività per lanalisi proteica sono state utilizzate per generare microarray per lintero proteoma con migliaia di proteine ricombinanti <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> microarray ad alta densità di proteine rappresentano un approccio basato su dati sperimentali che permette di identificare nuovi autoanticorpi che sono specifici per una varietà di malattie <NUMBER> <NUMBER> hudson et al hanno utilizzato un microarray proteine che conteneva <NUMBER> proteine umane per identificare una serie di autoanticorpi capaci di riconoscere <NUMBER> antigeni nei sieri di

controllo inoltre specificità e sensibilità diagnostica della lamina ac e di ssrp<NUMBER> combinate erano superiori quelle del ca <NUMBER> nellidentificare il tumore ovarico lo stesso approccio è stato usato per valutare la risposta immunitaria alle proteine patogeniche zhu et al <NUMBER> hanno prodotto un microarray per le proteine di coronavirus contenente <NUMBER> proteine purificate da coronavirus della sindrome respiratoria acuta sars e <NUMBER> altri coronavirus con lo scopo di monitorare la risposta immunitaria dei pazienti affetti da sars sono stati quindi esaminati <NUMBER> campioni di siero provenienti dallepidemia canadese di sars che includevano casi di sars da coronavirus certa casi di pazienti con insufficienza respiratoria e lavoratori di area sanitaria buono stato di salute lanalisi bioinformatica dei dati ha portato una corretta classificazione dei campioni nel <NUMBER> dei casi <NUMBER> di sensibilità diagnostica e <NUMBER> di specificità diagnostica <NUMBER> questo studio ha quindi dimostrato molto bene che microarray proteine possono essere utilizzati per la identificazione su larga scala di anticorpi specifici per virus nei sieri dei pazienti schmidt et al <NUMBER> hanno prodotto un microarray contenente <NUMBER> proteine pari al <NUMBER> del proteoma del virus vaccinico e lo hanno utilizzato per esaminare sieri di <NUMBER> soggetti vaccinati e di altri <NUMBER> soggetti non vaccinati questi autori hanno potuto dimostrare che la risposta anticorpale primaria alle singole proteine virali variava da individuo individuo che il numero totale di proteine riconosciute dagli anticorpi era solo lievemente variato dopo la seconda vaccinazione <NUMBER> questi dati hanno quindi dimostrato che microarray proteine potrebbero servire misurare la risposta immune umorale ai vaccini e fornire un semplice approccio per valutare vaccini di nuova produzione nellapproccio basato sulle conoscenze che rappresenta un approccio proteomico mirato biomarcatori potenzialmente importanti per una determinata patologia vengono ricercati sulla base delle conoscenze scientifiche disponibili gli svantaggi di questo approccio sono che risultati ottenibili sono dipendenti dalle attuali conoscenze scientifiche e che cè quindi il rischio di ignorare biomarcatori sconosciuti ciò nonostante lapproccio basato sulle conoscenze è ancora la migliore strategia quando si desidera esaminare analiti quali proteine della fase acuta molecole di vie di trasduzione del segnale e autoanticorpi <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> le citochine e le chimochine che

rappresentano uno strumento promettente di aiuto nella diagnostica delle malattie tiroidee nodulari sauer et al hanno utilizzato array proteici per meglio caratterizzare biopsie ad ago sottile da pazienti con tumore della mammella al fine di identificare un pannello di biomarcatori utili per definire specifici sottogruppi di pazienti con cancro <NUMBER> alcuni lisati preparati da biopsie

di molti di tali biomarcatori modelli animali di ibd sembrano quindi adatti per identificare nuovi biomarcatori non invasivi per il monitoraggio della progressione della ibd portando al tempo stesso meglio comprendere la patogenesi di tale condizione con evidente vantaggio per lo sviluppo di nuove terapie le osservazioni su modelli animali debbono naturalmente essere confermate con campioni da
