ausgebildeten industriearbeiterschaft das überragende interesse der usa einer stabilen weltwirtschaftsordnung mit offenen märkten war also durchaus auch eigennützig nur stabile märkte mit klaren handelsregeln waren aufnahmebereit für uswaren mit wechselnden motiven unterstützten die usa den folgenden dekaden die weiterentwicklung der internationalen handelsordnung bis hin zum abschluss der uruguayrunde <NUMBER> der die welthandelsorganisation wto aus der taufe gehoben wurde wesentliche beweggründe waren die idee die ehemaligen staatshandelsländer und etwas später auch das sich öffnende china eine welthandelsordnung zu integrieren die von der marktöffnung als leitmotiv bestimmt war mit sicherheit schwang dabei die absicht mit diese märkte für anbieter aus den usa besser zu öffnen und umgekehrt die usa selbst mit günstigen zwischenund konsumprodukten zu versorgen diese strategie verfolgten die usa ungeachtet des umstands dass das verarbeitende gewerbe der usa zu diesem zeitpunkt im außenhandel nur noch zeitgespräch hänge sie denken adhocdeals sehen ein handelsbilanzdefi zit als monetären verlust und handelsbilanzüberschüsse als gewinn im betriebswirtschaftlichen sinn sie beschränken sich auf die alleinige betrachtung der warenhandelsbilanz und blenden andere wichtige zusammenhänge wie z b den handel mit dienstleistungen primäreinkommen intrafi rmenhandel aus die schiere größe des usmarkts bewegt sie dazu zölle bzw generell politisches wohlverhalten wie ein eintrittsgeld den usmarkt zu nutzen und die gestiegene geopolitische unsicherheit bei kleineren partnern merkantilistisch auszubeuten ihrem betriebswirtschaftlichen kurzfristigen kalkül gibt es sogar einen anreiz unsicherheit zu schüren das resultatorientierte verhalten führt zusammen mit einer betriebswirtschaftlichen auffassung von außenwirtschaft zu einem unsteten um nicht zu sagen unzuverlässigen handelspolitischen verhalten der usa welchen einfl uss diese entwicklung jedoch zugleich auf die haltung der usa zum freihandel ausüben konnte war der harten usreaktion auf die japanischen exporterfolge den <NUMBER>er jahren abzulesen japanische anbieter sahen sich einem enormen druck ausgesetzt der zu freiwilligen exportbeschränkungen und mehr oder weniger erzwungenen japanischen direktinvestitionen den usa führte die schwankungen der ushaltung zu einer multilateralen handelsordnung haben sich nach <NUMBER> sowohl durch interne wie durch externe faktoren noch verstärkt zu den internen faktoren zählten z b das misstrauen gegenüber der wirksamkeit von regelsystemen im welthandel und einer beschränkung der eigenen souveränität dieses misstrauen war zwar schon immer vorhanden hinzu trat aber nun die verstärkte wahrnehmung eines gegensatzes zwischen regeln und resultaten die regeln waren und sind aus ussicht entweder zu vage formuliert die sanktionsmechanismen zu langsam und unzureichend sie sind für neue herausforderungen china ungeeignet oder sie greifen zu sehr die souveränitätsrechte ein traditionell reagieren die usa zudem besonders empfi ndlich auf konstruktionen die dazu führen dass internationale entscheidungen usrecht aushebeln können felbermayr <NUMBER> als externe faktoren kamen die auslagerung von amerikanischer produktion ins ausland offshoring das phänomen eines wachstums ohne mehr arbeitsplätze jobless growth und ein ausuferndes handelsbilanzdefi zit hinzu über allem rangierten der mit immer mehr unbehagen wahrgenommene wirtschaftliche aufstieg chinas und das scheitern der integration russlands die gruppe der marktwirtschaftlich und demokratisch verfassten länder diese faktoren führten zu der hinwendung der usa zu einer schnelllebigen vorteilhaften resultaten orientierten handelspolitik dies manifestiert sich nicht nur klar defi nierten und inzwischen auch quantifi zierten marktzugangszielen der usa wie schon beim von der obamaregierung formulierten ziel der verdopplung der usexporte zu beobachten vielmehr wuchs der merkantilismus mit dem amtsantritt der trumpadministration eine neue dimension hinein einfl ussreiche teile der neuen usregierung einschließlich des präsidenten selber missverstehen die wirtschaftspolitische aufgabe als betriebswirtschaftliches thema und verkürzen zusammen insbesondere die betonte rolle der nationalen sicherheit für die handelspolitik und die explizit angekündigte aggressive durchsetzung von ushandelsrecht akzentuieren den veränderten ansatz aber auch hinter dem ziel verbesserter handelsabkommen verbirgt sich handelspolitischer sprengstoff denn spätestens seit dem abschluss der neuverhandlungen zum nordamerikanischen freihandelsabkommen nafta nunmehr usmexicocanada agreement usmca genannt ist klar dass damit vor allem verschärfte ursprungsregeln und mehr local content gemeint ist also bedingungen die den globalen handel nicht fördern sondern bremsen von den nur drei jahre zuvor vom cea aufgelisteten argumenten ist kaum noch etwas übrig mit diesem handelspolitischen ansatz können die usa die rolle des kompensierenden hegemons die sie über dekaden im gatt und zunächst auch der wto einnahmen nicht mehr spielen hegemon sind die usa weil sie über jahrzehnte den mitgliedern des gattder wto nicht nur den zugang zum lukrativen usmarkt zu stabilen bedingungen boten sondern auch ihr politisches gewicht die waagschale warfen damit die regeln glaubwürdigkeit und gültigkeit behielten allerdings hat die welthandelsordnung mit dem protektionistischen ansatz der usa nicht nur ihren hegemon verloren man kann sie und die zugehörige welthandelsorganisation wto volkswirtschaftlich als klubgut charakterisieren als klubgut werden güter bezeichnet bei denen ausschließbarkeit von der nutzung möglich ist und keine oder eine nur geringe rivalität im konsum vorliegt die mitgliedschaft einem klub ist freiwillig nichtzahler können von der mitgliedschaft im klubder nutzung des klubguts ausgeschlossen werden diese defi nition trifft grundsätzlich auf die wto und ihre mitgliedschaft zu allerdings funktioniert ein solches klubgut umso besser je homogener die interessen der klubmitglieder sind je homogener die leistungen ausfallen und je ausgewogener die lastenverteilung ist langhammer <NUMBER> die wtomitglieder sind infolge der steigenden mitgliederzahl inzwischen ihren interessen sehr heterogen auch die homogenität der themen ist angesichts der ausweitung des themenspektrums der wto nicht mehr gegeben um ein extrembeispiel zu nehmen aus zollverhandlungen im gatt sind zuletzt sogar diskussionen um handel und geschlechtergerechtigkeit der wto geworden gerade für große wtomitglieder ist es deshalb sehr attraktiv geworden eine homogenität des klubgutes handelsordnung wieder herzustellen indem sie ihre interessen mit gleichgesinnten partnern außerhalb der wto verfolgenz b durch bilaterale und plurilaterale handelsabkommen beschwerdeführer und <NUMBER> fällen beschwerdegegner wto <NUMBER> eigene berechnungen damit entfi elen auf die usa <NUMBER> aller fälle zusätzlich beteiligten sich die usa <NUMBER> fällen als drittpartei folglich wird nur etwa ein viertel aller streitverfahren ohne usbeteiligung geführt fast der hälfte aller verfahren traten die usa aktiv entweder als beschwerdeführerin oder als drittpartei auf besser lässt sich das rege interesse der usa der wtostreitbeilegung kaum belegen geradezu exemplarisch zeigt sich die je nach politischer ausrichtung der regierung stärker denn je schwankende ushaltung zur rolle des freihandels insgesamt bei einem vergleich der argumentation der studie des council economic advisers cea zu den wirtschaftlichen vorteilen des außenhandels von <NUMBER> mit den aussagen der vom ushandelsbeauftragten ustr damit gerät allerdings auch der originäre anspruch der welthandelsordnung ins wanken die nichtdiskriminierung auf basis der gegenseitigkeit sie besteht aus den beiden komponenten meistbegünstigung und inländerbehandlung und ist damit angelegt dass auch mitgliedsländer mit geringerer marktgröße gleichberechtigt partizipieren können zusammen mit dem gesamtverpfl ichtungsansatz single undertaking der es erlaubt marktöffnungen unterschiedlichen sektoren gegeneinander aufzurechnen war die handelsliberalisierung ursprünglich strukturiert dass alle mitgliedstaaten ausreichend spielräume für erfolge und zugeständnisse hatten da zugleich ein hegemon vorhanden war hatte das wtoregelwerk eine vergleichsweise hohe bindungskraft und erschien nichtkooperatives verhalten lange zeit unattraktiv ihrer distanzierung von der bisherigen welthandelsordnung gehen die usa aber zuletzt konzeptionell auch noch deutlich über die eigenen wege anderer großer wtomitglieder wie der eu die ihren regionalen abkommen durchaus eigene akzente gesetzt hat hinaus dies lässt sich gut beispiel des sogenannten phaseiabkommens zwischen den usa und china belegen das im januar <NUMBER> abgeschlossen wurde zwar wurde mit dem abschluss dieses teilabkommens eine weitere eskalation des handelskonfl ikts zwischen den zwei größten volkswirtschaften der welt erst einmal abgewendet gleichzeitig ist das abkommen mit seinen umfassenden kaufverpfl ichtungen für china aber ausdruck eines kleinteiligen managed trade der konzeptionell im scharfen widerspruch zu den grundsätzen des freien und regelbasierten handels im rahmen der wto steht und im zweifel zulasten von drittländern geht anders als durch teil substitution anderer importe dürfte china insbesondere die verpfl ichtungen im agrarsektor aber auch im industriesektor nicht erfüllen können erschwerend kommt hinzu je höher der anteil von staatsunternehmen bzw das ausmaß staatlicher lenkung einem sektor ist desto leichter dürfte es china fallen bestimmte quantitativ formulierte einkaufszusagen zu erfüllen ein hoher staatseinfl uss ist china beispielsweise im energie gesundheitsoder luftfahrtsektor anzunehmen de facto stärkt der usansatz eines managed trade mit china damit paradoxerweise den staatshandelscharakter und die rolle staatsnaher bzw staatseigener unternehmen china zu diesem geradezu planwirtschaftlichen ansatz der ushandelspolitik tritt ein neues kleinteiliges buchsta länder auch china derzeit dazu neigen den export von medizinischen schutzprodukten restriktiv zu handhaben und da ein halbes jahr mit zusatzzöllen ausgereicht haben dürfte handelsumlenkungen auszulösen die nicht schnell umkehrbar sind das generell gewachsene misstrauen gegenüber der sprunghaftigkeit der ushandelspolitik könnte ein weiterer retardierender faktor sein dass diese erfahrungen ausreichen damit die usa ihren eigenen handelspolitischen ansatz fundamental überdenken erscheint im lichte des ustypischen pragmatismus möglich anstöße der wichtigsten ushandelspartner zum richtigen zeitpunkt also unmittelbar nachdem das schlimmste überwunden ist könnten der stelle hilfreich wirken discovery new coronavirus origin

auf der straße eine längere lagerung der probe sollte nur dann stattfinden wenn ein rascher transport nicht möglich ist die lagerung führt zur verfälschung von untersuchungsergebnissen durch das absterben besonders empfindlicher keime und durch änderungen der quantitativen zusammensetzung der vorgefundenen keime daraus können sowohl falschnegative als auch falschpositive befunde entstehen zur richtigen lagerung der proben gibt es nur wenige wissenschaftliche untersuchungen weshalb dem schnellen transport ins labor unbedingt vorrang einzuräumen ist generell können die tab <NUMBER> aufgeführten lagerungsbedingungen empfohlen werden primär sterile materialien die auch anspruchsvolle und empfindliche keime enthalten können sollten bei raumtemperatur aufbewahrt werden materialien

insbesondere bei kindern unter zwei jahren ein generelles »urinscreening« klinisch unauffälliger patienten ist nicht gerechtfertigt ausnahmen sind schwangere oder patienten vor interventionellen eingriffen der harnwege gelegentlich wird zwei bis drei tage nach beginn der antimikrobiellen therapie eine routinekontrolle des urins zur überprüfung der wirksamkeit veranlasst dies ist nicht sinnvoll und sollte unterbleiben die beurteilung der therapieeffektivität erfolgt aufgrund klinischer kriterien antigenelisa weist jedoch einige schwächen bei der sensitivität auf daher sollte als suchtest im antigenelisa der glutamatdehydrogenasegdhnachweis erfolgen der eine hohe sensitivität aufweist ist dieser test positiv muss jedoch ein toxin abelisa oder eine entsprechende pcr angeschlossen werden da die gdh als gemeinsames antigen auch bei nicht toxinproduzierenden c difficile und anderen clostridien nachweisbar ist aus der mitteilung dass eine blutkultur positiv geworden ist und dem ergebnis der untersuchung des grampräparats lassen sich häufig bereits erste schlüsse auf die ätiologie der erkrankung des patienten ziehen zudem kann eine anpassung der antibiotikatherapie vorgenommen werden insbesondere bei befunden die der empirischen therapie nicht unbedingt berücksichtigt werden z b grampositive stäbchen bei listerieninfektion die mikroskopischen befunde werden durch zusätzliche untersuchungsergebnisse die direkt aus der bewachsenen blutkultur gewonnen wurden untermauert z b hinweis für mrsa oder n meningitidis der gleichzeitige nachweis desselben erregers einer blutkultur und der katheterspitze gilt als hinweis auf das vorliegen einer katheterassoziierten blutstrominfektion viele dieser erkrankungen werden durch eine bakterienart

sterilen kompartimenten der regel ätiologisch bedeutsam der kultur können typische erreger unterer atemwegsinfektionen wie pneumokokken moraxella catarrhalis haemophilus influenzae enterobakterien oder pseudomonas aeruginosa gut angezüchtet werden der nachweis potenziell kontaminierten materialien korreliert häufig mit der klinik die unterscheidung zwischen infektion und kolonisation muss jedoch der zusammenschau aller befunde durch den kliniker erfolgen beweisend ist hingegen der nachweis aus primär sterilen materialien wie z b aus einem pleurapunktat oder einer blutkultur bei spezifischen erregern die physiologischerweise nicht im respirationstrakt vorkommen wie beispielweise mycobacterium tuberculosis oder legionella pneumophila weist der nachweis ebenfalls sehr sicher auf eine entsprechende infektion hin serologische verfahren beruhen auf dem nachweis von spezifischen antikörpern oder erregerantigenen antikörper werden bei kontakt mit entsprechenden antigenen mit einigen tagen bis wochen verzögerung gebildet sodass sie vielen fällen für die akute diagnostik nicht geeignet sind aufgrund der einfachen materialgewinnung werden antikörperuntersuchungen jedoch häufig durchgeführt und sind für die beantwortung spezifischer fragestellungen auch sehr hilfreich grundsätzlich kann beim nachweis einmalig erhöhter titer oder eines mindestens vierfachen titeranstiegs von einem ersten oder erneuten kontakt mit den erregern ausgegangen werden auch die antikörperklassen sind abhängig von der jeweiligen erkrankung für die differenzialdiagnostik von großer bedeutung der regel werden bei akuten infektionen iga oder igm gebildet indikationen für antikörperuntersuchungen sind <NUMBER> ätiologische klärung von infektionen insbesondere auch nach

antibiotikatherapie nachweisbar <NUMBER> relativ einfache handhabung keine laborausrüstung notwendig <NUMBER> testkits meist lange haltbar <NUMBER> meist teurer als herkömmliche diagnostische methoden <NUMBER> liefern nur qualitative ergebnisse das lipopolysaccharid lps aus der zellwand der bakterien ist bereits <NUMBER> h nach infektion nachweisbar und wird über wochen ausgeschieden aufgrund der langfristigen ausscheidung ist der test nicht zur therapiekontrolle geeignet da das antigen bei anderen bakterien nicht vorhanden ist ergibt sich für alle kommerziell erhältlichen tests eine hohe spezifität von über <NUMBER> den meisten tests werden jedoch nur antikörper gegen l pneumophila serogruppe <NUMBER> verwendet sodass für infektionen mit dieser serogruppe eine hohe sensitivität von <NUMBER> bis zu über <NUMBER> besteht kreuzreaktionen zu anderen serogruppen kommen gelegentlich vor weisen jedoch eine niedrige sensitivität auf ein nachweis von infektionen durch nonpneumophilaspezies ist nicht möglich infektionen durch l pneumophila serogruppe <NUMBER> geeignet sie verursachen mehr als <NUMBER> der ambulant erworbenen und über <NUMBER> der reiseassoziierten erkrankungen nosokomiale infektionen hingegen sind zur hälfte durch andere serogruppen bedingt daher sollten diesem fall zusätzliche diagnostische methoden wie kulturelle und pcrverfahren aus respiratorischen proben veranlasst werden eine kulturelle anzucht ist auch bei epidemiologischen fragestellungen und gehäuftem auftreten von erkrankungen sinnvoll der nachweis des legionellaantigens im urin ist beweisend für eine legionellenerkrankung der test kann jedoch nicht nur bei einer legionellenpneumonie sondern auch fällen von pontiacfieber positiv sein da die antigenausscheidung variiert ist eine legionellose bei einem negativen testergebnis nicht ausgeschlossen bei anhaltendem klinischem verdacht sollte die untersuchung daher wiederholt werden der nachweis von legionellaantigen im urin ist nach § <NUMBER> infektionsschutzgesetz meldepflichtig das cpolysaccharid von streptococcus pneumoniae wird vor allem bei bakteriämischen erkrankungsverläufen im urin ausgeschieden es sind auch testkits verfügbar die den nachweis von pneumokokken liquor nasopharyngealen sekreten oder pleuraflüssigkeiten ermöglichen der test ist als zusätzliches schnelles diagnostisches verfahren bei der diagnose der ambulant erworbenen pneumonie von erwachsenen sinnvoll wird jedoch den s<NUMBER>leitlinien zur ambulant erworbenen pneumonie cap und zur nosokomialen pneumonie nicht als routinediagnostik empfohlen da pneumokokken im spektrum der antibiotischen therapie enthalten sind höffken et al <NUMBER> dalhoff et al <NUMBER> kinder und kleinkinder sind bis zu <NUMBER> pneumokokkenträger daher sind urinantigentests bei ihnen häufig falschpositiv die sensitivität beträgt <NUMBER> die spezifität liegt bei über <NUMBER> der test ist damit als alleiniges verfahren ungeeignet und sollte durch kulturelle untersuchungen von respiratorischen materialien und blutkulturen ergänzt werden dies ist auch sinnvoll um eine resistenztestung durchführen zu können da die verbreitung penicillinresistenter stämme zunimmt ein positiver befund kann zur fokussierung der antibiotischen therapie beitragen wobei die möglichkeit falschpositiver befunde und polymikrobieller infektionen zu bedenken sind auf der anderen seite schließt ein negativer test eine pneumokokkenpneumonie nicht aus und sollte daher bei weiter bestehendem klinischem verdacht ggf wiederholt bzw durch weitere untersuchungen ergänzt werden die diagnostik entzündlicher prozesse umfasst die analyse der leukozytenzahl und des differenzialblutbilds der blutkörpersenkungsgeschwindigkeit und bei vorliegen septischer erkrankungen die analyse von parametern der gerinnungsaktivierung und fibrinolyse darüber hinaus hat sich eine reihe von biomarkern zur diagnostik mikrobieller erkrankungen etabliert das creaktive protein crp ist ein akutephaseprotein dessen plasmakonzentrationen bei systemischen entzündungsreaktionen durch proinflammatorische zytokine wie interleukin<NUMBER> il<NUMBER> stimuliert wird es wird der leber synthetisiert und gelangt über das plasma zum ort der entzündung dort nimmt es als teil des angeborenen immunsystems der immunabwehr teil es kann potenziell toxisches material aus gewebeschädigungen oder strukturen von mikroorganismen binden anschließend wird deren abräumung veranlasst die crpkonzentrationen steigen im rahmen von infektiösen prozessen aber auch bei gewebeschädigungen wie z b operativen eingriffen bei malignen tumoren oder malignen systemerkrankungen sowie bei einigen autoimmunerkrankungen der referenzwert des crp liegt bei <NUMBER> mgl und steigt innerhalb von <NUMBER> h nach beginn der infektion der maximalwert ist nach operativen eingriffen meist nach <NUMBER> h erreicht und fällt dann mit einer halbwertszeit von <NUMBER> h wieder ab bei infektionskrankheiten können die werte ohne adäquate therapie für tage bis wochen erhöht sein je nach infektionserreger bzw krankheitsverlauf werden unterschiedliche typische crpanstiege beobachtet tab <NUMBER> tät beobachtet werden bouadma et al <NUMBER> nobre et al <NUMBER> da der gebrauch von antibiotika als starker trigger für die entwicklung multiresistenter bakterien gilt ist dies ist aus krankenhaushygienischrt sicht sehr positiv zu werten pctbasierte algorithmen haben sich auch bei infektionen der unteren atemwege als sehr hilfreich erwiesen sie sind hier sowohl bei der indikationsstellung als auch bei der beendigung einer antibiotikatherapie sinnvoll einsetzbar auch hier zeigen erste studien dass es zu einer reduktion

vielen dank für ihre unterstützung liebe mitglieder der fhdggv wenige tage bevor die tagung der fhdggv leipzig beginnen sollte mussten wir die veranstaltung absagen nachdem die tagungsleitung und der vorstand der fhdggv anfang märz noch recht optimistisch waren zwang uns die entwicklung des coronavirus sarscov<NUMBER> mit steigenden fallzahlen und den gesundheitspolitischen rahmenbedingungen zum handeln allerdings lagen bereits zu dem zeitpunkt etliche stornierungen durch teilnehmer und referenten vor denen von seiten ihres arbeitgebers die teilnahme größeren veranstaltungen untersagt wurde viele beteiligte aber insbesondere ruth kaufmannknoke und andreas musolff haben viel aufwand mühe zeit und persönliches engagement die tagung investiert und ich selbst hoffte bis kurz vor der absage dass die tagung stattfinden kann wir haben eine verschiebung diskutiert allerdings ist aufgrund der langen vorlaufund vorbereitungszeit für die tagung mit langfristig erforderlichen reservierungen ein termin vor der tagung <NUMBER> jahren jena nicht realistisch auch die durchführung einer rumpftagung bei der eine große anzahl vorträgen keynotes exkursionen fortbildungen etc entfällt und nicht klar ist stattfindet und nicht war unattraktiv dass wir uns gegen diese option entschieden haben auch bei einer absage der tagung bleibt ein großer teil der ausgaben bestehen die vorbereitung der tagung hat inzwischen hohe kosten verursacht ebenso die anmietung der kongresshalle der caterer sowie die anmietung von auerbachs keller für das konferenzdinner diese kosten ohne die gegenfinanzierung durch die kalkulierten <NUMBER> teilnehmer übersteigen die finanzielle leistungskraft der fhdggv leider ist es auch keineswegs dass wir aus unseren finanziellen verpflichtungen ohne weiteres entbunden werden da die meisten veranstaltungsmöglichkeiten langfristig gebucht werden müssen gehen auch wir als fhdggv langfristige verpflichtungen ein wir versuchen selbstverständlich mit dem caterer der kongresshalle dem auerbachs keller und den anderen dienstleistern eine kulante kostenregelung auszuhandeln es wird sich zeigen inwieweit das möglich ist und obwohl ihnen rechtlich die erstattung der tagungsgebühren bei der absage der veranstaltung zusteht haben wir alle teilnehmerinnen und teilnehmer gebeten zu prüfen ob sie einen teil der tagungsgebühren als spende der fhdggv zukommen lassen können oder durch den kauf des tagungs unter dieses motto hat die un den diesjährigen weltwassertag gestellt ein thema mit dem sich die kommunale wasserwirtschaft deutschland bereits seit geraumer zeit beschäftigt wie hanshermann baas vizepräsident der allianz der öffentlichen wasserwirtschaft aöw erklärt wir agieren nachhaltig und ressourcen schonend sowohl bei der gewinnung als auch der verteilung von wasser mit den millionenschweren investitionen die infrastruktur hält die kommunale wasserwirtschaft nicht nur die wasserverluste den netzen bewusst gering sie sorgt zudem für die sicherung der trinkwasserversorgung der stadt und im ländlichen raum für alle einwohner gleichermaßen das ist eine beachtliche leistung wie die letzten heißen sommer gezeigt haben angesichts des klimawandels fordert aöwvizepräsident baas ein klares bekenntnis der politik zugunsten der kommunalen wasserversorgung die nutzung für mensch und tier muss vorrang genießen ohne wenn und aber dieses klare bekenntnis wird nicht zuletzt im wasserdialog der bundesregierung durch andere nutzergruppen immer wieder infrage gestellt das ist für uns nicht tragbar den heißen sommern der beiden letzten jahre hätten die kunden deutschland kaum einschränkungen der wasserversorgung gespürt lediglich regional musste sehr heißen und trockenen phasen das rasensprengen teilweise zeitlich eingeschränkt werden das ist der guten leistung der fachkräfte zu verdanken die kommunalen wasserversorger haben … ihre konzepte entsprechend angepasst sie haben den klimawandel als herausfordernde aufgabe aktiv angenommen und werden weitere szenarien prüfen führt baas aus klar sei für ihn dass das bewusstsein für die begrenzung der ressource gestärkt werden müsse und das bei allen nutzergruppen bei den privathaushalten bei der industrie und auch bei der landwirtschaft wir alle müssen unseren beitrag leisten noch bewusster mit der kostbaren ressource wasser umzugehen für baas gehöre dazu auch dass die politik die nutzungskonkurrenzen um das grundwasser stärker den blick nehme nicht nur die menge sondern auch die qualität müsse langfristig gesichert werden dazu gehöre die minimierung von einträgen ins grundwasser da der großteil der wassergewinnung deutschland aus grundwasser erfolgt ist die lokale nutzung gerade auch zeiten des klimawandels mit dem zunehmenden wasserbedarf spitzenverbrauchszeiten von besonderer bedeutung die lokalen vorkommen müssen nachhaltig guter qualität erhalten werden beim nitrat ist der anfang aufgrund des drucks aus brüssel gemacht hier muss die politik konsequent weitergehen und die rahmenbedingungen schaffen die den eintrag ins grundwasser weiter deutlich reduzierenund zwar durch die verursacher hier darf nicht der wasserkunde einseitig belastet werden der aöwvizepräsident zudem werbe er für flexiblere lösungen für die wasserwirtschaft um auch die bewirtschaftung heißen monaten zeiten des klimawandels leisten zu können hier mussten wir erleben dass die genehmigungen nicht immer die notwendige flexibilität aufweisen die der klimawandel mit seinen schnellen änderungen die wir den hitzemonaten der letzten beiden jahre erlebt haben uns auferlegt um die spitzenverbräuche auch weiter verlässlich abzudecken es das dargebot erlaubt benötigt auch die wasserwirtschaft mehr flexibilität der behörden auch das fordert der klimawandel ein mein lieber fhdggpräsident ich muss mich mal wieder bei dir melden ich mache es auch kurz mir ist neulich ganz seltsames passiert seltsam deshalb weil ich mich jedes detail erinnere und normalerweise geht mir das einer situation gar nicht meistens weiß ich kaum mehr etwas also ich schaue aus dem fenster und sehe beim nachbarn der immer fröhlich winkt einen tanklkw stehen mit großen grünen

der flansch noch der lkw ich habe dann meine post nachgesehen und einen brief von der landesregierung gefunden wo man mir mit freundlichen worten die finanzielle beteiligung der energieerzeugung

denke ich zeiten der minusnullzinspolitik und virenoder sonstigen postkrisenbörsencrashzeiten ein tolles angebot wo ist der haken dann lese ich dass es sich um erneuerbare energien handelt windräder solarund biogasanlagen sowie wasserstofferzeugungsanlagen unter beteiligung lokaler firmen und landwirtschaftsbetriebe garantiert oligarchenfrei und jede r bürgerin kann über die angegebene

eu viel weitblick hätte ich der ursel gar nicht zugetraut und europäischer technologiekonzerne ein paar hundert unbewohnte griechische inseln zu energieproduktionsinseln umfunktioniert hatten es soll auch die deutsche industrie mit den wasserstofffabriken und dem wasserstofftankerbau ganz gut verdient haben dieses angebot musste ich erstmal überlegen natürlich mit einem schluck leitungswasser <NUMBER> cent der liter bioqualität da klingelte es der tür der landwirt vom hof vorne der landstraße wo ich immer mit dem rad vorbeifahre zur arbeit steht da und grinst ich sehe manchmal seine schweine und kühe auf der weide beim vorbeifahren und die grinsen genau ob ich vielleicht frische lebensmittel brauche die ernte ist aufgrund der neuen biondüngemittelausgüllenitrattechnologie deutlich höher ausgefallen seine nitrateintragsrate hat er gut einen anderen landwirt verkauft auch weil er mit realen bodennitratwerten sein neues gis besser kalibrieren konnte jo sag ich der lkw ist weg ging schnell der landwirt geht ich sehe noch wie die nachbarin ihr auto mit einem anderen schlauch einem flansch der hauswand verkoppelt da war denke ich die japaner sind wieder mal vorn mit dem

toxinnachweis im stuhl diagnostiziert dieser ist als pcr oder antigenelisa direkt aus dem stuhl oder über eine kultur möglich der toxinnachweis aus dem stuhl ist sehr spezifisch der antigenelisa weist jedoch einige schwächen bei der sensitivität auf daher sollte als suchtest im antigenelisa der glutamatdehydrogenasegdhnachweis erfolgen der eine hohe sensitivität aufweist ist dieser test positiv muss jedoch ein toxin abelisa oder eine entsprechende pcr angeschlossen werden da die gdh als gemeinsames antigen auch bei nicht toxinproduzierenden c difficile und anderen clostridien nachweisbar ist aus der mitteilung dass eine blutkultur positiv geworden ist und dem ergebnis der untersuchung des grampräparats lassen sich häufig bereits erste schlüsse auf die ätiologie der erkrankung des patienten ziehen zudem kann eine anpassung der antibiotikatherapie vorgenommen werden insbesondere bei befunden die der empirischen therapie nicht unbedingt berücksichtigt werden z b grampositive

sternotomiewunde bzw nach implantation einer hüfttotalendoprothese sind als potenzielle krankheitserreger zu betrachten wohingegen sie bei gemeinsamem nachweis mit enterobakterien undoder enterokokken darmresektionswunden vernachlässigt werden können typische erreger postoperativer wundinfektionen sind staphylococcus aureus streptococcus andere erreger wie pneumocystis jirovecii werden mittels pcr ebenfalls sehr zuverlässig detektiert hierbei stellt sich jedoch oft die frage nach der relevanz der befunde bei hivpatienten lassen sich p jirovecii aufgrund der hohen erregerzahlen meist problemlos im mikroskopischen präparat nachweisen bei allen anderen patienten ist der mikroskopische nachweis häufig nicht zielführend da deutlich weniger erreger vorhanden sind sodass sich mikroskopisch falschnegative befunde ergeben ist die pcr positiv muss anhand klinischer laborchemischer und radiologischer parameter zwischen erkrankung und kolonisation unterschieden werden jüngster zeit wurden quantitative realtimepcrverfahren entwickelt sie helfen eine differenzierung zwischen infektion und kolonisation vorzunehmen die identifizierung mikrobiologischer isolate erfolgt klassischerweise anhand makroskopischer und mikroskopischer morphologischer kriterien sowie mit tests die gattungsspezifische biochemische stoffwechseleigenschaften der erreger überprüfen dies kann durch einzelreaktionen reagenzgläsern durch die analyse mehrerer parameter im mikroformat einer bunten reihe oder automatisiert analysegeräten erfolgen je geringer die stoffwechselaktivität desto schwieriger ist die differenzierung als alternative bieten sich neuere verfahren die nukleinsäuren mit molekulargenetischen methoden oder proteine massenspektrometrisch analysieren und eine differenzierung der erreger auch bei geringer stoffwechselleistung ermöglichen serologische verfahren beruhen auf dem nachweis von spezifischen antikörpern oder erregerantigenen antikörper werden bei kontakt mit entsprechenden antigenen mit einigen tagen bis wochen verzögerung gebildet sodass sie vielen fällen für die akute diagnostik nicht geeignet sind aufgrund der einfachen materialgewinnung werden antikörperuntersuchungen jedoch häufig durchgeführt und sind für die beantwortung spezifischer fragestellungen auch sehr hilfreich grundsätzlich kann beim nachweis einmalig erhöhter titer oder eines mindestens vierfachen titeranstiegs von einem ersten oder erneuten kontakt mit den erregern ausgegangen werden auch die antikörperklassen sind abhängig von der jeweiligen erkrankung für die

falschpositiver befunde und polymikrobieller infektionen zu bedenken sind auf der anderen seite schließt ein negativer test eine pneumokokkenpneumonie nicht aus und sollte daher bei weiter bestehendem klinischen verdacht ggf wiederholt bzw durch weitere untersuchungen ergänzt werden die diagnostik entzündlicher prozesse umfasst die analyse der leukozytenzahl und des differenzialblutbilds der

vom <NUMBER> bei denen von <NUMBER> getesteten davon praktisch <NUMBER> risikopatienten lediglich <NUMBER> <NUMBER> positiv waren als goldstandard mit jedenfalls nicht bekannter externer validierung etwa durch antikörpertests oder eben auch klinisch hingenommen man kennt offiziell weder sensitivität noch spezifität und wie hoch die positiven oder negativen vorhersagewerte wirklich wären kann man sich bei einer prävalenz der coronainfektion von etwa <NUMBER> fast eine orphan disease wirklich ausrechnen noch dazu wo man aus einzelfallbeobachtungen weiß dass wechselnde testergebnisse gar nicht selten vorkommen und dass das fenster für den positiven nachweis ein relativ kurzes ist ganz rezent stellt dazu eine publikation den annals internal medicine fest dass die wahrscheinlichkeit eines falschnegativen resultates des pcrtestes expositionstag <NUMBER> zu symptomenbeginn – ungefähr vier tage später – <NUMBER> und drei tage nach symptombeginn <NUMBER> beträgt danach würde sie wieder ansteigen „vorsicht ist geboten bei der interpretation von rtpcr tests für die sarscov<NUMBER>infektion – besonders der frühen infektionsphase wenn man diese ergebnisse als basis für vorsichtsmaßnahmen zur infektionsvorbeugung heranzieht wenn der klinische verdacht hoch ist kann die infektion durch den negativen rtpcr test alleine nicht ausgeschlossen werden“ schließen die autoren <NUMBER> die anzahl der positiven testergebnisse österreich bedeutete im umkehrschluss ja auch dass bei entsprechender symptomkonstellation eine <NUMBER> wahrscheinlichkeit auf das nichtvorliegen einer coronainfektion besteht einem anderen ergebnis nämlich der seropositivität von nur fünf prozent der bevölkerung infektionshotspots wird dagegen keinerlei aufmerksamkeit geschenkt denn das würde schlicht und herb bedeuten dass die kontagiosität dieses virus eine relativ überschaubare ist und warum dieser verzicht auf evidenz erstens gibt es nicht wirklich viel gesichertes über die coronavirusinfektion zum anderen es kommt angst ins spiel beziehungsweise wird sie ins spiel gebracht und diese angst lässt eine nüchterne betrachtung aus welchen gründen immer nicht recht zu angst lässt eine nüchterne betrachtung nicht zu allerdings ist nicht nur ein zytokinsturm mit covid<NUMBER> verbunden sondern vor allem auch ein „publikationssturm“ die eingabe „covid<NUMBER>“ als suchbegriff pubmed ergibt <NUMBER> vormittags <NUMBER> ergebnisse ob diese oeuvres den üblichen qualitätskriterien genügen beziehungsweise wirklich wissensvermehrend sind muss wohl frage gestellt

erkrankungen andererseits auch zahlreiche therapieansätze für die covid<NUMBER>erkrankung mit dem zytokinsturm ihrer schwersten ausprägung sehr bekannt vor manchmal musste man dazu auch schon etwas älter sein denn wer kennt heute noch aranofin das orale goldpräparat selbst das hat man der therapie der coronavirusinfektion versucht älter sind auch viele rheumapatienten und die älteren sind eine sogenannte risikogruppe die alle vorgeben schützen zu wollen es scheint aber dass niemand die seniorinnen und senioren gefragt hat ob sie überhaupt dieser form geschützt werden wollen beziehungsweise welche auswirkungen isolation auf das befinden der menschen hat dieser ausgabe berichtet johann hitzelhammer wiengloggnitz über einen patienten mit einer selten entzündlichen gelenkerkrankung die auch mit einer heftigen entzündlichen aktivität bis hin zum makrophagenaktivierungssyndrom ein zytokisturm einhergehen kann der praxis stellt der adulte still eine wesentliche wenn auch seltene differenzialdiagnose dar bei der das daran denken die halbe miete für den erfolg ist niemand hat die senioren gefragt ob sie überhaupt dieser form geschützt werden wollen und auch der zweite beitrag hat seinen bezug zu covid<NUMBER> nämlich den eines betroffenen organs der lunge nämlich die im falle der systemischen sklerose prävalenz <NUMBER> – also eine orphan disease leider häufig nicht nur die lebensqualität sondern auch die lebenserwartung bestimmt zeiten von infektionen erscheint das management von autoimmunerkrankungen wichtiger denn je um die infektanfälligkeit der betroffenen zu

due maintain safety community supervised eine haltung als psychoanalytiker und psychotherapeut die auf transparenz und teilhabe achtet verändert die perspektive auf den psychoanalytischen prozess dabei ist zu erfahren welch wertvolle begleiter transparenz und teilhabe sind unseren patienten und analysanden wird es leichter uns ihren gedanken und gefühlen teilhaben zu lassen eine für den therapieerfolg unabdingbare voraussetzung es entsteht ein dialog der von der dyade gemeinsam hervorgebracht und getragen wird im therapeutischen prozess kann über spezifische übertragungsmomente und deren einfluss auf die beziehung kommuniziert werden dieser arbeit möchte ich zeigen welcher gewinn aus einer transparenten haltung reflektierter offenheit und wechselseitiger teilhabe entsteht und welche weiterführenden möglichkeiten sich daraus ergeben das führe ich beispiel der introjektiven identifizierung aus wenn ich der männlichen form schreibe meine ich beide geschlechter transparenz entsteht wenn der patient die grundregel der freien assoziation als aufforderung zu offenheit ernst nimmt und der therapeut reflektierter offenheit nach außen und nach innen gleichschwebender aufmerksamkeit und gebotener abstinenz die unbewussten prozesse zu verstehen und zu interpretieren sucht diesen letzten teil fasse ich nochmal kürzer transparenz entsteht aus der reflektierten offenheit des therapeuten nach meinem verständnis verlangt dies bisweilen auch dass der therapeut sein empfinden mitteilt sein schweigen kann auch wenn es abstinent intendiert ist manchen momenten manipulativ wirken luiz <NUMBER> gibt ein eindrucksvolles beispiel einer notwendig transparenten behandlung wieder transparente momente entstehen behandlungen besonders dann wenn überraschende begegnungen die beispielsweise moments stern <NUMBER> entstehen analysiert werden teilhabe wird wechselseitig verstanden der analysand lässt seinen analytiker seinen assoziationen teilhaben der analytiker wiederum lässt seinen analysanden seinen überlegungen und empfindungen insoweit teilhaben wie diese für den analytischen prozess fruchtbar sinnvoll und zur klärung notwendig sind teilhabe ist also ein prozess zwei richtungen vom patienten richtung auf den therapeuten und vom therapeuten richtung auf seinen patienten beide nehmen aktiv teil und lassen passiv sich teilhaben diesen vorgang beschreiben stolorow und atwood <NUMBER> aus relationaler sicht ferro <NUMBER> unter dem gesichtspunkt des feldes das bohleber <NUMBER> <NUMBER> ein kontinuierliches gemeinsames träumen das wachtraumdenken bei bion <NUMBER> auflöst und das von ogden <NUMBER> <NUMBER> revolutionär neu einer passageren auflösung der subjektgrenzen konzipiert wird das große feld der intersubjektiven und relationalen psychoanalyse präsentiert sich vielgestaltig altmeyer und thomä <NUMBER> nennen ihr buch die vernetzte seele im untertitel die intersubjektive wende der psychoanalyse die beiden autoren gehen davon aus dass es die ergebnisse der säuglingsforscher sind die der intersubjektivität letztlich zum durchbruch verholfen haben aus einer anderen perspektive sieht bohleber <NUMBER> der kritischen gesellschaftstheorie der <NUMBER>erjahre einen ausgangspunkt dafür dass sich die intersubjektive sicht durchgesetzt hat die philosophischen ansätze von buber und binswanger hatten großen einfluss auf die tiefenpsychologie deutschland die zum teil noch geprägt war vom alten göringinstitut wenn auch die damaligen ansätze bereits die fundamentale bedeutung der intersubjektivität betonten gelang die übersetzung reale klinische beziehungskonstellationen nicht zu einer neuaufnahme der themen um intersubjektivität kam es ausgehend von der kritischen gesellschaftstheorie ab den <NUMBER>erjahren lorenzer hebt <NUMBER> <NUMBER> hervor dass sich das hier beschriebene verstehen der interaktion der subjekte mit ihrer mitwelt und umwelt zu wendet ebenso lässt sich eine psychoanalytischintersubjektive sicht auf dem theoretischen fundament von klein und bion gründen böhme <NUMBER> und mertens <NUMBER> wiederum legt seinem aufsatz das zweipersonenunbewusste unbewusste wahrnehmungsprozesse der analytischen situation den schwerpunkt auf die unbewusste wechselseitige einstimmung aber auch die perspektive des psychoanalytischen feldes mit sich dieses feld hinein auflösender individualität wie von baranger und baranger <NUMBER> sowie von ferro <NUMBER> und ogden <NUMBER> beschrieben kann als theoretische untermauerung einer intersubjektiven betrachtungsweise gewählt werden intersubjektives psychoanalytisches denken und arbeiten wurden der vergangenheit durch vielgestaltige auch außerhalb der psychoanalyse gelegene einflüsse befördert auch der gegenwart beeinflussen die gesellschaftlichen entwicklungen unsere psychoanalytische theorie der veränderte umgang mit daten und das wachsende bewusstsein zur infomationellen selbstbestimmung wirken auf unsere theorie und praxis ebenso wie der gewaltige druck der beispielsweise aufgrund einer epidemie wie covid<NUMBER> coronavirus disease <NUMBER> auf der bevölkerung lastet daraus entstehende konflikte lassen sich einem demokratischen gemeinwesen nur durch transparenz und teilhabe mildern die begriffe transparenz und teilhabe die ich für die psychoanalytische theorie und behandlungstechnik vorschlage tragen dazu bei aktuell bedrohlichen entwicklungen einen mit hoffnung angereicherten sprachlichen ausdruck gegenüberzustellen eine besondere rolle spielt diesem zusammenhang der abwehroder interaktionsmechanismus der introjektiven identifizierung transparenz und teilhabe helfen dabei die unbewussten anteile der introjektiven identifizierung zu entschlüsseln den zusammenhang und das zusammenspiel dieser mechanismen werde ich der vorliegenden arbeit theoretisch untersuchen und einem klinischen beispiel veranschaulichen ebenso vielgestaltig wie theorie und praxis der intersubjektivität ist heutzutage die handhabung der abstinenz dies ist nur folgerichtig wenn wir uns die geschichte der begriffe abstinenz und indifferenz freud <NUMBER>a vergegenwärtigen die aus der zeit der triebtheorie freud <NUMBER>b und des zweiten topischen modells ab <NUMBER> freud <NUMBER>b stammen die erste zeit der psychoanalyse war geprägt von modellen denen personen eher voneinander abgegrenzt aufgefasst wurden freud <NUMBER>e heute hingegen weisen die modelle der intersubjektiven affektivität auf wege hin wie durch affekte personengrenzen überschritten werden und interaktionen die psyche des anderen hineinwirken können im jahre <NUMBER> plädiert cremerius für eine operationale anwendung der abstinenzregel als funktion des analytischen prozesses <NUMBER> ogden geht zwanzig jahre später erheblich weiter <NUMBER> <NUMBER> und spricht im rahmen der projektiven identifizierung von einer passageren auflösung der subjektgrenzen von analytiker und analysand insoweit sich die wahrnehmung der subjektgrenzen auflöst ist eine abstinenz die diese grenze eigentlich voraussetzt nicht mehr eindeutig zu definieren zusammenfassend ergibt sich daraus nach ermann <NUMBER> <NUMBER> eine neukonzeption des klassischen abstinenzprinzips aus intersubjektiver sicht ist diese regel die oft sehr starr gehandhabt wurde durch ein funktionales prinzip ersetzt worden danach hat der analytiker je nach lage der dinge zu entscheiden ob wie weit und welcher form er auf wünsche und begehren des patienten eingeht um anschließend zu untersuchen wie der patient sein verhalten verarbeitet zu diesem reflexionsprozess trägt eine haltung von transparenz und teilhabe wesentliches bei weil durch sie die motive der interaktion klarer beschrieben und bearbeitet werden können nach meiner einschätzung finden im psychoanalytischen theoriegebäude transparenz und teilhabe nicht die beachtung die ihnen aufgrund ihres potenzials unbewusstes bewusst werden zu lassen zukommt ich verfolge meiner arbeit die dass dies insbesondere für die bearbeitung der introjektiven identifizierung k gilt sie kann günstigenfalls dann gelingen wenn der analytiker einer haltung arbeitet durch die transparent wird gerade vor sich geht seit ferenczi <NUMBER> sind uns die grundlagen für das verständnis der introjektiven identifizierung bekannt die er seiner berühmten arbeit sprachverwirrung zwischen den erwachsenen und dem kind gelegt hat es war dann klein <NUMBER> die den vorgang der introjektiven identifizierung auf den begriff gebracht hat die introjektive identifizierung wie wir sie heute verstehen ist ein abwehrund interaktionsmechanismus der der grenze zwischen pathogenese und salutogenese steht durch die initiale introjektion verschwinden quasi konflikthaftbedrohliche affekte im unbewussten der introjizierenden person insofern trägt der vorgang einen pathogenetischen charakter die folgen im neurotischen geschehen können bis zur entwicklung eines falschen selbst führen auf der anderen seite kann der depressiven position eine identifizierung des subjektes mit den introjizierten affekten die tür zu einer neuen entwicklung öffnen mit dem aufscheinen eines neuen verständnisses beginnt eine salutogenetische wirkung der introjektiven identifizierung diese prozesse können sowohl im individuellen leben wie der psychoanalyse geschehen neue erfahrungen entstehen aus einer bewussten aneignung der zunächst unbewussten introjektion der regel nimmt im psychoanalytischen prozess der analytiker zuerst etwas wahr das sich seinem inneren fremd nicht zu ihm gehörend anfühlt das gefühl der fremdheit kann längere zeit verborgen bleiben erste wahrnehmungen tauchen auf und kündigen die mögliche bewusstwerdung erst vorsichtig dann ermutigt durch ein erstes verstehen kommt der weg zu einem bewussten verständnis gang dem maße wie dieser vorgang gelingt öffnet sich ein verständnis für umfangreiche bisher nicht bewusstseinsfähige zusammenhänge um zusammenzufassen durch den mechanismus der introjektiven identifizierung kann von unbewusst zu unbewusst eine brücke zwischen analytiker und analysand geschlagen werden den zentralen unterschied der introjektiven im vergleich zur projektiven identifizierung fasst schoenhals hart <NUMBER> <NUMBER> wie folgt die introjektiven identifizierungen mit den guten objekten fördern die integrative entwicklung richtung depressiver position während die projektiven identifizierungen den ausstieg aus dieser entwicklung bedeuten beispiele für introjektive identifizierungen finden wir unseren behandlungen häufig dann wenn es der entwicklung des kindes eine notwendigkeit oder einen zwang gab empathiegeleitet mithilfe einer introjektiven identifizierung zu versuchen unverständliches verletzendes elterliches verhalten durch übernahme und verinnerlichung zu entschärfen das kind nimmt unverständliches sich auf bildet daraus ein introjekt und identifiziert sich damit die äußere gefahr wird durch verinnerlichung entschärft das kind verzichtet damit aber zugleich auf eigene entwicklung und versucht stattdessen die eltern die es dringend braucht doch noch gut genug zu machen ferenczi hat es seinem aufsatz <NUMBER> beschrieben den inneren abbildern jener vorgänge und dem häufig damit verbundenen entwicklungsverzicht begegnen wir sehr viel später unserem behandlungszimmer eine haltung empathischer transparenz des analytikers bietet dann die chance verborgene signale aufzunehmen introjektive identifizierungen bewusst zu machen und dadurch einen ausweg zu öffnen diesen weg illustriere ich nun meiner fallvignette eine vorbemerkung zum verständnis von vignetten mit schülein <NUMBER> gehe ich von der psychoanalyse als einer wissenschaft aus die mit konnotativen theorien arbeitet daher bleiben ihre aussagen zwangsläufig offen und unscharf narrative gebunden falldarstellungen können folgerichtig keine beweise liefern sie beziehen ihre qualität aus ihrer plausibilität und begründen ein denken fällen wie dies hampe und strassberg beschreiben <NUMBER> <NUMBER> dreyer <NUMBER> <NUMBER> die methode der psychoanalytischen erkenntnis ist eine disziplin die mythen und geschichten aus der literatur zu entwicklungsschemata formalisiert und sie zusammen mit wirklich erhobenen fallgeschichten aus der psychoanalytischen praxis zum erkenntnishintergrund individueller geschichten macht als ich heute vor ihrer haustüre stand wollte ich mit meinem schlüssel aufschließen beginnt die patientin heiter die stunde ihre fehlleistung ist für mich ein zeichen dass sie bei mir eine heimat gefunden hat der stunde spricht sie über ihre aktuelle beziehung und die bedeutung von sexualität sie fragt sich ob ihr partner für sie der richtige sei ich stelle nach einiger zeit überrascht fest dass mir traurigkeit entsteht sie passt nicht zu der stimmung und dem tonfall der patientin ich kann mir mein empfinden selbst nicht erklären ich bin weder bedrückt noch traurig die stunde gekommen im zuhören bleibe ich mit dieser diskrepanz beschäftigt und frage mich ob ich diese im sinne der negative capability bion <NUMBER> <NUMBER> aushalten oder durch aussprechen die diskrepanz der reflexion zugänglich machen soll wenn ich eine möglichkeit wähle verliere ich damit zugleich die andere und beeinflusse jedem fall den weiteren verlauf auch durch schweigen den gedanken ich könnte komplementär zu ihr die empfindungen ihres verlassenen freundes fühlen spreche ich aus dieses verstehensangebot gewinnt jedoch keine bedeutung sehr viel später der reflexion der hiesigen veröffentlichung erkenne ich meinem frustranen deutungsversuch eine parallele zum vergeblichen versuch meiner patientin mit ihrem schlüssel mein haus aufzuschließen ich habe bemerkt dass ich während ihrer schilderung traurig wurde ohne dass ich sagen könnte weswegen formuliere ich dann offen der weitere verlauf der stunde nimmt eine überraschende wendung wir fragen uns der stunde ob ihr beziehungsproblem mit ihrer missbrauchserfahrung als teenager zu tun haben könnte sie gebraucht im gesprächsverlauf den ausdruck dumm um ihre aktuelle reaktion der stunde und ihr selbstempfinden generell zu beschreiben ich frage nach woraufhin sie bekräftigt ich bin dumm ich bitte um weitere erläuterung sie findet schließlich zu einem literarischen vergleich mithilfe des romans <NUMBER> von orwell <NUMBER> darin würden sich die protagonisten selbst dumm machen sagt sie gehe es ihr auch sie sei ebenso dumm wie die bürger im roman von orwell und betont damit den aktiven part des sichselbstverdummens der aktiven k icheinschränkung von der ferenczi <NUMBER> schrieb ganz im gegensatz zum inhalt ihrer überlegung finde ich ihre erklärung ausgesprochen klug nun tauchen mir mögliche zusammenhänge zwischen ihrem gefühl dumm zu sein und meinem gefühl von traurigkeit auf ich frage mich ob mein mir rätselhaft gebliebenes gefühl möglicherweise ihre abgewehrten nicht ins bewusstsein zugelassenen affekte enthält traurigkeit entsteht stellvertretend mir während die patientin nach ihrer aussage kein anderes mittel fand als sich selbst zu verdummen um quälende zusammenhänge unbewusst zu halten als ich diesen zusammenhang ausspreche beginnt für die patientin der weg ihre selbstverdummung und ihre scham darüber zu verstehen und die lang verborgenen emotionen wieder zu erleben ich denke dass ich zunächst im rahmen einer introjektiven identifizierung die trauer aus dem unbewussten der patientin übernahm nur über mich konnte sie auch ihr bewusst werden zum verständnis der vignette sie beginnt mit einer fehlleistung die wir manchmal fortgeschrittenen behandlungen beobachten können wenn patienten versuchen mit ihrem schlüssel die praxis ihres analytikers aufzuschließen ebenso wie die praxis für meine patientin bleibt mir meine empfindung zu beginn der stunde verschlossen und mein erster deutungsversuch war ebenfalls vergeblich gleichzeitig wird durch die fehlleistung der wunsch ausgedrückt zugang zum verborgenen zu finden der stunde entfaltet sich ein unbewusster plan der patientin die offenkundige fehlleistung und mein erstes nichtverstehen erklären nicht auf welchem wege mich die empfindungen erreicht haben die ich als fremd wahrnahm ich gehe im verstehensprozess der stunde davon aus dass es auf vollkommen unbewusstem weg geschah die fremdheit ist ein klinisches zeichen dem ich immer wieder begegne dreyer <NUMBER> es handelt sich um eine besondere qualität des fremden unerklärlichen und ichdystonen zunächst gilt es meine eigenen affekte ihrer bedeutung für die behandlung zu erschließen dieser weg führtso meine erfahrung zum erfolg wenn ich mich dazu entschließe transparent zu benennen dass es da etwas gibt das ich spüre das ich mir allein aber nicht erklären kann dieses vorgehen gründet der annahme dass es sich um eine introjektive identifizierung handelt durch die ich unbewussten meines patienten oder analysanden unmittelbar teilhabe und die über meine gegenübertragung aufzufinden ist der austausch darüber schafft bewusstsein wenn er einer atmosphäre der transparenz und teilhabe stattfindet es ist weiter meine dass es sich um abläufe handelt die regelhaft und verschiedenen analysen ähnlich wiederkehren um dies näher auszuführen werde ich nun unter dem aspekt von transparenz und teilhabe die theorie zur gegenübertragung und zur introjektiven identifizierung näher betrachten um danach erneut meinem fall meine thesen abschließend zu diskutieren bahnbrechend für unser heutiges verständnis der gegenübertragung waren die veröffentlichungen von heimann <NUMBER> heimann <NUMBER>a zur gegenübertragung und heinrich racker <NUMBER> racker <NUMBER> übertragung und gegenübertragung studien zur psychoanalytischen technik beide arbeiten erscheinen im gleichen jahr und betonen unabhängig voneinander dass die gegenübertragung nicht länger als hindernis zu betrachten ist sondern vielmehr ein förderndes element für die analyse darstellt das zunächst als technischer fehler erschien wurde zum katalysator des therapeutischen prozesses racker <NUMBER> racker <NUMBER> sah bereits die möglichkeit der wechselseitigen bezogenheit von übertragung und gegenübertragung von analytiker und analysand es kann also auch die gegenübertragung des analytikers sein die erst die übertragung des analysanden anschiebt die dann anschließend vom analytiker gedeutet wird das henneeiproblem löst sich auf wenn man nicht mehr vorhernachherkategorien denkt sondern von einer wechselwirkung ausgeht der satz die gegenübertragung des analytikers geht der übertragung des patienten voraus drückt dann nur die eine hälfte des geschehens aus er könnte ergänzt werden durch den satz die übertragung des analytikers geht der gegenübertragung des analysanden voraus heimann <NUMBER>b vertieft ihre auffassung <NUMBER> jahre nach der erstveröffentlichung <NUMBER> mit einem titel der bereits die kernaussage der arbeit formuliert über die notwendigkeit für den analytiker mit seinem patienten natürlich zu sein sie berichtet eine überraschende intuitivdeutung die wäre sie nicht treffend kränkend gewirkt hätte zur überraschung beider öffnet die analytikerin durch diese deutung eine lange von ihrer patientin verschwiegene geschichte die die analyse entscheidend voranbringt die autorin weist darauf hin dass ihr vorgehen weiterer ausarbeitung bedürfe racker und heimann machten mit ihren veröffentlichungen deutlich welch überraschende erkenntnisse die analyse der gegenübertragung zugänglich macht andere autoren entwickeln die intersubjektive auffassung von gegenübertragung weiter jacobs <NUMBER> gabbard <NUMBER> und ogden <NUMBER> bezogen auf das feldkonzept schließlich baranger und baranger <NUMBER> sowie ferro <NUMBER> auf eindrucksvolle weise deutet besonders ogden <NUMBER> <NUMBER> diese ereignisse analysen er zeigt wie enactments oftmals für das verständnis des unbewussten prozesses entscheidend sind und die aufgabe darin besteht sich ihnen träumerisch überlassen zu können bis sich ein neues verständnis eingestellt hat ogden beschreibt damit eine radikale verwandlung dabei im psychoanalytischen prozess geschieht ist ein partieller zerfall der unbewussten dialektik von subjektivität und intersubjektivität dieser zerfall führt schließlich zur erzeugung einer besonderen form des analytischen dritten der sich analytiker und analysand als getrennte subjekte hohem maße unterwerfen dem dritten der unterwerfung eine erfolgreiche psychoanalyse bedeutet dass die daran beteiligten dieses unbewusste dritte das nur eine spielart von intersubjektivität ist aufheben und sich den im psychoanalytischen prozess freilich verwandelten subjektstatus wieder aneignen indem sie zu eigenständigen und gleichwohl voneinander abhängigen individuen werden das erreichen sie dadurch dass sie einander gegenseitig anerkennen wie gelangen die von racker theoretisch ausgearbeiteten und von ogden klinisch dargestellten phänomene die interaktion der partner der dyade und wie können sie bewusst gemacht werden eine antwort ergibt sich aus der beschreibung der brückenfunktion der introjektiven identifizierung ogden beschreibt klinisch den sich im unbewussten abspielenden brückenschlag zwischen den beiden der analytischen situation beteiligten unterscheidet jedoch nicht zwischen projektiver und introjektiver identifizierung er spricht nur von projektiver identifizierung ich halte es für zulässig seine beschreibung einer partiellen und passageren auflösung der subjektgrenzen für die introjektive identifizierung zu übernehmen gerade der introjektiven identifizierung sind die übernahme und vermischung von affekten beider beteiligter subjekte zu beobachten bollas <NUMBER> <NUMBER> ff fügt den beiden mechanismen noch die extraktive introjektion hinzu zunächst ist eine abgrenzung der introjektiven von der projektiven identifizierung erforderlich der literatur werden beide vorgänge der großen übersichtsarbeit von grotstein <NUMBER> beschrieben sodré <NUMBER> und spillius <NUMBER> unterscheiden zwischen projektiver und introjektiver identifizierung sie betonen die positivlibidinösen seiten der introjektiven identifizierung und warnen zugleich vor ihrer idealisierung oshaugnessy <NUMBER> <NUMBER> weist darauf hin dass die introjektive identifizierung im vergleich zur projektiven identifizierung insgesamt wenig beachtet wurde dies ergänzt scharff <NUMBER> sowohl für die projektive als auch für die introjektive identifizierung aus intersubjektiver sicht eekhoff <NUMBER> benennt schließlich die außergewöhnliche qualität des wechselseitigen austauschs von unbewusst zu unbewusst und nennt die wirkung der introjektiven identifizierung ihrem titel evokativ eine differenzierung zwischen den unbewussten vorgängen der projektiven und der introjektiven identifizierung bei der projektiven identifizierung wird der projizierte inhalt vom projizierenden als nicht mehr zu seiner person gehörend wahrgenommen der projizierte inhalt wird stattdessen demjenigen zugerechnet der damit projektiv identifiziert wurde der projizierende ist dadurch vom inhalt seiner projektion befreit bei der introjektiven identifizierung dagegen bleibt der innere dialog des introjizierenden mit den introjizierten inhalten bestehen introjiziert wird etwas fremdes das teilen als fremd erkennbar bleiben kann anderen teilen dem erfahrungshorizont des introjizierenden nahe vertraut ist letzteres bildet den anker für die bewusstwerdung die extraktive introjektion bollas <NUMBER> <NUMBER> ist ein mechanismus bei dem ein mensch das innenleben eines anderen eindringt und bestimmte elemente davon vereinnahmt das opfer einer extraktiven introjektion fühlt sich der betreffenden anteile seines selbst beraubt ist das opfer ein kind hat es keine klare vorstellung davon weshalb es auf bestimmte elemente seines psychischen lebens kein recht zu haben scheint sie spielt sich also im inneren des introjizierenden ab und steht der projektiven identifizierung ihrem aggressivaufgeladenen modus nahe wie wird aus einer introjektiven identifizierung ein fruchtbarer beitrag zur behandlung die brückenbildung der introjektiven identifizierung beruht auf der zweiseitigen eigenschaft des introjizierten inhalts einerseits bleibt er spürbar behaftet mit etwas fremdem bislang unbekanntem und andererseits ist er stabil eingebettet die psyche dessen der introjiziert mit etwas übung kann dieser doppelcharakter vom analytiker im dialog herausgespürt werden es findet zuerst eine innere prüfung und aufarbeitung der phase der gegenübertragungsanalyse im analytiker statt wurde mir zur introjektion angeboten und wurde von mir introjiziert soweit spielt sich der vorgang im inneren des analytikers ab im nächsten schritt wird mithilfe der noch vagen hypothese ein brückenschlag versucht eingeleitet durch worte die vorsichtig das ungewöhnlichunsichere des vorgehens zum ausdruck bringen um dem analytiker einen rückzug von seiner idee zu ermöglichen sollte ein irrtum vorliegen sollte der patient durch neu ins bewusstsein tretende einfälle dem dialog eine entscheidende wendung geben dürfen wir davon ausgehen dass es gelungen ist unbewusstes und abgespaltenes material aufzuspüren wir prüfen und präzisieren dann unsere hypothese wenn dies alles gelingt ist die analyse einen wesentlichen schritt vorankommen hier noch einmal die möglichen wirkungen und chancen der konzeptualisierung der introjektiven identifizierung als einem brückenkonzept dem analytiker wird es möglich empfindungen aus seinem eigenen unbewussten mit anteilen aus dem unbewussten seines analysanden zu verbinden sich diese bewusst zu machen und als analytisches material zu nutzen eine bereicherung des analytischen prozesses im analysanden bleiben die prozesse der introjektiven identifizierung zunächst unbewusst sie stammen aus seiner kindheit und bedürfen der analytischen aufarbeitung da sie mit umfangreichen pathologischen abwehrvorgängen verbunden sind mithilfe der inneren arbeit des analytikers gelingt es einen bewussten zugang zu finden und die gründe für die abspaltung ins unbewusste aufzuheben den zwei jahren der zweistündigen behandlung im sitzen gibt es viele bewegende momente denen beispielsweise meine art die treppe herunterzukommen sie ihren professeur erinnert dazu unsere mikrointeraktion im ersten behandlungsjahr bemerkt sie einmal sie könne nicht denken mir geht es der stunde ähnlich schließlich kommt mir der einfall es ist die zerstörung durch den missbrauch der missbrauch zerstört das denken wenn ich als professeur die treppe herunterkomme haben wir jetzt hier sonst draußen bleibt die erinnerung den missbrauch ab diesem moment verbindet sich mit meinem treppab die alte missbrauchssituation die nun folgende ausführliche sequenz liegt zwei wochen vor dem material meiner eingangsvignette die patientin kommt zurückhaltender als sonst eine stunde ist wenn wir schweigen fragt sie mich ich vermute sie bestätigt dass sie darüber nachdenkt ob sie mich dann langweilen würde das wäre eine große gefahr denn ihrer fantasie wird aus langeweile missbrauch wir gelangen durch diese unscheinbare eingangsfrage unmittelbar die vergangene welt ihres missbrauchs bald darauf fasst sie sich versehentlich mit dem finger ihr rechtes auge und sagt entschuldigung mich berührt schmerzlich dass sie sich selbst schmerzen zufügt und sich auch noch dafür entschuldigt unklar bleibt bei wem wir sprechen weiter darüber es mit dem schweigen auf sich haben könnte und dass dies für sie mit der angst einhergeht es könnte etwas schreckliches wie ein missbrauch passieren mir dämmert ich noch nicht glaube aussprechen zu können meine assoziation ein auge auf jemanden werfen führt mich schließlich zu der deutung ob sie sich wohl deshalb entschuldigt habe weil sie seltsam es auch klingen mag tatsächlich schuld empfinde schuld dafür dass sie langeweile habe entstehen lassen wodurch sie den professeur provoziert haben könnte oder genauer sie könnte im rückblick denken dass sie ihn provoziert und dadurch das ganze missbrauchsunglück selbst ins rollen gebracht habe die patientin denkt kurz darüber nach ich bin sehr sorge ob ich ihr zu viel zugemutet habe dann lacht sie befreit und sagt das stimmt sie schüttelt den kopf darüber ich herausgefunden habe sie ist durch meine deutung nicht gekränkt sondern befreit ein besonderer moment der behandlung eine der folgestunden kommt sie guter stimmung setzt sich und lacht es sei schön gewesen im konzert das sie im ausland gespielt hat über nacht sei sie mit drei kollegen zwei violinen und einem cello hingefahren kleine stadt kirche mitten im see auf einer insel die aus dem see herausragt es hat gut geklappt morgen ihr chef mit ihr sprechen alle waren sehr angetan bei ihr lief es sehr gut auch die anderen finden das überhaupt ist sie frei im rücken keine verspannungen mehr ihre kollegen sind oft schlechter laune sie nicht nach einiger zeit der ich darüber nachdenke welche bedeutung wohl dieses bild des sees mit insel und kirche hat fragt mich die patientin woran ich denke ich spreche meiner antwort über meine im stillen entwickelte hypothese ob es wohl richtig sei von einer art umkehrung ins gegenteil zu sprechen da ist die insel im see umgeben von wasser eine isolierte idylle mit konzert und besuchern und als bild des gegensatzes dazu das haus des professeur einsam und isoliert isoliert im schrecken zu meiner überraschung antwortet die patientin ja genau das ist es ich bin perplex denke das ist ihr schnelles tempo und weiß selbst nicht ihre antwort bedeutet ich hatte unfertige gedanken ausgesprochen und finde zunächst keine verbindung zu ihrer reaktion ich weiß jetzt nicht wie sie das meinen sage ich deshalb daraufhin erläutert sie mir wie sie den letzten tagen immer wieder über einen satz von mir nachdenken muss der sie jedes mal aufs neue befreie es war meine antwort auf die frage des professeur die sie sehr quälte er fragte sie ob sie sex hatte mit <NUMBER> stellt sie ihre hochgradige irritation von damals dar hinter der ich die extraktive introjektion des klavierlehrers vermute befreit habe sie dass ich vor ein paar stunden kommentiert hatte das war sein gedanke seither wird sie nicht mehr von fragen gequält weil sie erkennen kann dass es gar nicht ihr thema sondern seines war offenbar wurden die folgen der extraktiven introjektion durch den professor der ihr das gefühl ihrer unschuldigen körperlichkeit genommen hatte durch meinen hinweis dass es seine gedanken waren wirksam aufgelöst immer wieder sei sie seit unserer stunde auf diese erkenntnis zurückgekehrt und jedes mal sei danach die geschichte anders befreit verlaufen das habe ihr gute laune gemacht dass sie sich nicht mehr durch die frage hat ihn zu der vermutung gebracht belastet fühle ich glaube verstanden zu haben und sage ich habe ssie ihnen geschenkt gleich ist mir meine bemerkung ihrer doppeldeutigkeit peinlich einerseits kann sie auf die gute laune bezogen werden andererseits kann sie auf die patientin als person bezogen werden und das eine oder das andere hätte ich ihr geschenkt die patientin befreit mich aus meiner peinlichen lage und verbessert mich nein zurückgegeben ich antworte erleichtert ja sie haben recht zurückgeben ist das richtige wort ich kann noch anfügen hier hat sich zwischen uns eben wiederholt worüber wir sprachen einer kleineren dimension natürlich dann ist die stunde zu ende k zwei wochen später ereignet sich die stunde von der ich eingangs berichtet habe meine patientin versucht die praxistüre mit ihrem schlüssel aufzuschließen und mich beschleicht das gefühl der traurigkeit psychoanalytischen behandlungen sind viele wege möglich auf denen unbewusstes verstanden werden kann nur einer davon wird verwirklicht im prozessgeschehen stellt sich die frage wie lange im hinblick auf das ziel der bewusstwerdung soll man indifferenz und offenheit abwarten und sich dem wachtraumdenken bion <NUMBER> überlassen wann und wie lassen sich introjektive prozesse optimal verstehen es kann im zuhören zu früh gedeutet oder zu lange gewartet und beiden fällen die besonderheit des augenblicks verpasst werden die bedeutung des augenblicks für eine deutung fasst strachey <NUMBER> <NUMBER> den begriff des point urgency für die darstellung einer fallvignette und ganz generell gilt darüber hinaus die plausibilität einer fallgeschichte bleibt gebunden idiosynkratische kreisprozesse deren ablauf sich im kreislauf zwischen annahme einer psychodynamik deutung der interaktion beobachtung der reaktion vermutung über erreichte effekte und korrektur der annahme abspielt jede prognostische aussage bleibt ebenso einem kreisprozess verhaftet und immer offen für alternative konzeptualisierungen und alternative kreisprozesse zur wissenschaftstheoretischen einordnung dieses vorgehens greife ich auf die erläuterungen zum denken fällen von hampe und strassberg <NUMBER> <NUMBER> vgl obigen abschnitt eine fallvignette zurück durch generalisierung wie sie uns auch aus mythen und geschichten entgegentritt entstehen entwicklungsschemata und narrative die einen gesetzmäßigen charakter haben im alltag der klinischen stunde wird das entwicklungsschema zur grundlage der deutenden analytischen aktivität gleichzeitig damit bleibt auch das entwicklungsschema selbst offen für modifikation mit schülein <NUMBER> auf meine bemerkung zur diskrepanz mir und zwischen uns antwortet die patientin überraschend und sagt ich bin dumm sie erläutert ihre empfindung mit einem literarischen bild das mir die selbstverdummung als schutzmechanismus erklärt das legt mir den gedanken nahe dass ich gefühle von traurigkeit über die auswirkungen des missbrauchs empfinde die ihr noch unbewusst sind ich gelange zur annahme einer introjektiven identifizierung mein mir fremdes gefühl von traurigkeit enthält die von mir introjizierten affekte ich war eindeutig mit diesem gefühl identifiziert es war mein gefühl über dessen ursprung ich mir gedanken machte und zugleich war es dem noch unbewussten empfinden meiner patientin nahe die deutung des zusammenhangs selbstverdummung als schutz vor den auswirkungen des traumatischen geschehens wirkt befreiend meine patientin findet ihre traurigkeit wieder die traurigkeit die ich zu stundenbeginn diskontinuierlich empfinde kann als eine vorwegnahme eine vorleistung des analytikers gestalt einer introjektiven identifizierung verstanden werden loch versteht unter einer notwendigen vorleistung <NUMBER> <NUMBER> den moment dem der analytiker den infantilen übertragungswunsch seiner analysanden zunächst seiner gegenübertragung auflöst dann kann auch der analysand erkennen er übertragen hat meiner fallvignette entdeckt die patientin dass sie weder beim kranken misshandelten vater noch beim aggressivmissbrauchenden klavierlehrer sitzt lochs gedankengang wirkt sich rückblickend konzeptualisierend aus thomä betont seiner arbeit aus dem jahr <NUMBER> vom spiegelnden zum aktiven analytiker

característico de las culturas desarrolladas uno de los factores que influyen en ese conocimiento social es la existencia de registros los registros de nacimiento de defunción son buenos instrumentos para conocer nuestra historia social en españa encontramos documentos de registros de este tipo que datan del siglo xvi preservados en las parroquias junto con las partidas de bautismo con el tiempo la inscripción se hizo también al margen de las iglesias fue el estado de massachusetts el primer lugar en mantener registros de defunción en los tribunales de justicia <NUMBER> <NUMBER> la certificación médica de defunción apareció en el último tercio del siglo xix por varios motivos por un lado la mayor proximidad asistencial del médico al moribundo en el ámbito urbano junto con la fundamentación científica de la higiene pública que en gran parte se apoyó en el desarrollo de la estadística sanitaria de la prevención pública esto también dio lugar nuevas legislaciones códigos civiles al origen de los registros civiles además la incorporación de la estadística sanitaria llevó la internacionalización de la prevención de la enfermedad fines del siglo xix casi todos los países europeos tenían sistemas centralizados de registros de mortalidad en <NUMBER> tras varios intentos se logró la puesta en marcha del registro civil rc en españa <NUMBER> este avance vino precedido por un periodo de transición que supuso la implantación de un j u r n l p r e p r f registro parcial provincial para grandes medianas poblaciones en el año <NUMBER> la ley exigía todos los municipios la creación de un rc en el que se debían inscribir los datos referentes al estado civil de todos los españoles nacimientos matrimonios defunciones etc al margen de sus creencias un siglo más tarde en <NUMBER> se constató la necesidad de actualizar renovar la ley entonces vigente adaptándola las necesidades de la época dando lugar la ley de <NUMBER> de según el reglamento que desarrolla la ley del rc debe cumplimentar el cmdbed el facultativo que haya asistido al difunto en su última enfermedad cualquier otro que reconozca el cadáver <NUMBER> el código de deontología médica cd <NUMBER> regula el compromiso de certificar la muerte señalando que aunque el médico que haya tenido la mayor carga asistencial sobre el paciente es el que tiene la mayor responsabilidad ética de cumplimentar el certificado de defunción en todos sus apartados es deontológicamente aceptable rehuir el compromiso de certificarla cuando se produce si se ha presenciado la misma se conoce al paciente se tiene disposición la historia clínica en el reverso del primer impreso del cmdbed encontramos unas instrucciones básicas de certificación figura <NUMBER> que establece la oms para seguir la hora de cumplimentar el certificado cuando se trata de muertes violentas sospechosas de criminalidad procede la firma del cmdbed derivándose estas muertes investigación judicial <NUMBER> el procedimiento general de manejo notificación de los fallecimientos se recoge en la figura <NUMBER> el cmdbed es un documento médicolegal en el que el profesional debe poner el mismo esfuerzo dedicación que en el resto de los informes elaborados en vida del paciente clínica éticamente se puede firmar un certificado con criterios de presunción si el desenlace es posible hay compatibilidad entre la información sobre las circunstancias del fallecimiento su patobiografía siendo aceptable en cambio firmarlo escudándose en un posible delito de falsedad que recoge el código penal en nuestra experiencia la de otros autores se confirma que difícilmente se perseguirá un médico que de buena fe previa exploración del paciente certifique como natural una muerte que lo sea <NUMBER> siendo un deber ético la cumplimentación del cmdbed en esta situación se prioriza el ahorro de sufrimiento los familiares por delante de las dudas legales razonables humanizando el trato en unas circunstancias de padecimiento emocional tan intensas <NUMBER> desde su publicación en <NUMBER> el cmdbed ha sufrido alguna modificación en la primera versión del cmdbed las hoy llamadas causas intermedias se denominaban también causas antecedentes tras menos de dos años el ine comprobó que se estaba cumplimentando equivocadamente dicha variable elaboró un documento que hizo llegar los médicos través de los cm <NUMBER> en él se recogía que muchos médicos han interpretado este campo como antecedentes clínicos como debería entenderse es decir anotar en las llamadas causas antecedentes aquellos procesos que siendo debidos la causa inicial produjeron la causa inmediata de muerte recientemente se han modificado incorporando código qr recogiendo el número de colegiación de nueve cifras estableciendo las casillas de forma independiente para su adecuada cumplimentación la correcta cumplimentación del cmdbed tiene importantes consecuencias desde el punto de vista de política sanitaria en base ellos el ine extrae de estos documentos las causas de defunción con los que genera las estadísticas oficiales de mortalidad según los resultados obtenidos se toman medidas de prevención se destinarán los recursos necesarios para afrontar las necesidades existentes mediante la implementación de políticas sanitarias cumplimentar adecuadamente las causas de muerte figura <NUMBER> puede tener una gran importancia desde el punto de vista epidemiológico <NUMBER> derivando como consecuencia de esto en una mala organización de los recursos destinados la salud tanto en la investigación de enfermedades como en la implantación de políticas preventivas j u r n l p r e p r f existe poca experiencia en nuestro medio en relación la certificación de fallecimientos durante las epidemias se entiende que si se producen múltiples fallecimientos los procedimientos de actuación podrían ser semejantes los de situaciones de catástrofe como sostienen barbería et al <NUMBER> las catástrofes constituyen un problema de salud pública al ser susceptibles de incrementar la morbilidad mortalidad disminuir la calidad de vida las epidemias cumplen evidentemente estas condiciones el papel de la certificación de las causas de la muerte en el caso de grandes catástrofes corresponde la medicina forense <NUMBER> el de la certificación en epidemias corresponde la medicina asistencial <NUMBER> pero la comparación puede ser útil en el establecimiento de procedimientos para el manejo de cadáveres la certificación de la muerte en casos de múltiples fallecimientos en epidemias <NUMBER> quizá el único ejemplo que tenemos en españa de epidemias con múltiples fallecimientos con registros de los mismos es la pandemia de gripe de <NUMBER> su estallido generó múltiples estudios científicos análisis estadísticos una fuerte reacción de la prensa partir de mayo de <NUMBER> fue una experiencia terrible para la sociedad que generó múltiples medidas para combatirla por parte de los gobiernos respuestas extraordinarias por parte de los profesionales de la salud de la población en general los estudios sobre la pandemia de gripe de <NUMBER> han comprendido sólo el análisis de los datos de morbimortalidad que son muy importantes en si mismos sino que también ha llevado una comprensión de la epidemia más allá de las cifras para poder evaluar las repercusiones que la epidemia tuvo sobre la mortalidad contamos con la información contenida en los movimientos naturales de población elaborados por el ine con los boletines mensuales de demografía sanitaria que confeccionaba el ministerio de la gobernación estos datos sin embargo son insuficientes para descender detalles por ejemplo los relacionados con los distritos de las ciudades porras <NUMBER> ha estudiado la estadística demográfica que confeccionaba anualmente el servicio de estadística del ayuntamiento de madrid así como los resúmenes generales anuales de esas estadísticas demográficas el cruce de esos datos con los fondos del rc los libros de defunción correspondientes los años <NUMBER> <NUMBER> ha permitido determinar con detalle la evolución de la morbimortalidad de la pandemia en españa <NUMBER> sin embargo ayer como hoy las cifras de mortalidad cambiaban según los criterios que se aplicaban así por ejemplo en el caso de madrid las tasas brutas de mortalidad general específica de <NUMBER> <NUMBER> que se obtenían partir de los datos del rc de los resúmenes generales anuales de las estadísticas demográficas del ayuntamiento de madrid eran muy diferentes ya que civilmente las muertes se consignaron en el distrito correspondiente su j u r n l p r e p r f lugar de fallecimiento mientras que el ayuntamiento elaboró sus estadísticas partir de los datos de los cementerios donde las muertes se anotaban en el distrito en el que se residía en el que se moría es un ejemplo de la complejidad de los estudios de morbimortalidad históricos <NUMBER> <NUMBER> recomendaciones nacionales e internacionales sobre la certificación médica de la defunción en relación al covid<NUMBER> el <NUMBER> de marzo de <NUMBER> el cgcom emitió un comunicado en el que de acuerdo con las definiciones propuestas por la oms la vocalía nacional de administraciones públicas informaba acerca del procedimiento seguir en la certificación de las defunciones durante la actual epidemia de covid<NUMBER> <NUMBER> el documento señala que las muertes producidas en una epidemia son muertes naturales hace falta comunicar al ámbito médicolegal judicial el fallecimiento la intervención judicial del médico forense se limitará los casos de muerte violenta en los que exista clara sospecha de criminalidad en esos casos en los que la investigación de la muerte corresponde al ámbito medicolegal el hecho de presentar una pcr sarscov<NUMBER> positiva indica un dato de interés epidemiológico que quizá deba tenerse en cuenta como factor agravante si la muerte se produce de forma diferida al hecho traumático pero esa posible concausa corresponde analizarla al profesional forense en el resto de los casos la certificación de la muerte corresponde los médicos asistenciales con independencia de que trabajen en un ámbito público privado en la misma línea de lo recogido en otros países de nuestro entorno <NUMBER> <NUMBER> si previamente señalábamos que ante el fallecimiento de una persona se debe priorizar el ahorro de sufrimiento los familiares por delante de las dudas legales razonables la hora de la certificación humanizando el trato en unas circunstancias de padecimiento emocional tan intensas <NUMBER> en circunstancias como las vividas en esta pandemia este principio se hace mas necesario que nunca el documento del cgcom establecía dos escenarios la hora de certificar muertes covid<NUMBER> el primero se refería aquellos en los que existe confirmación analítica pero hay clínica compatible con la enfermedad en estas circunstancias se recomendaba certificar como covid<NUMBER> confirmado sospecha de infección por coronavirus como causa fundamental como causa inmediata se proponía usar fallo multiorgánico distrés respiratorio insuficiencia respiratoria aguda señalando que podrán reflejarse causas intermedias si las hubiera se conocieran como neumonía sepsis coagulopatía el segundo escenario es aquel en el que los casos de covid <NUMBER> se han confirmado mediante test de laboratorio en esos casos la causa fundamental deberá ser covid<NUMBER> confirmado para cualquiera de los escenarios anteriores un tema importante es cómo se registra la comorbilidad de los pacientes fallecidos por covid<NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> el documento de la omc señala que en el apartado otros procesos deberán recogerse las patologías comorbilidades que conllevan un mayor riesgo de desarrollar enfermedad grave si existieran enfermedades cardiovasculares hipertensión arterial diabetes en ocasiones se planea la disyuntiva de morir por covid<NUMBER> morir con covid<NUMBER> pudiendo resultar complejo determinar si es la enfermedad covid<NUMBER> la causante del proceso de la muerte lo es una patología previa aquí sólo cabe la reflexión del facultativo que firma el certificado la vista de los datos de la evolución clínica del paciente fallecido lo que puede requerir un estudio profundo de su historial médico en todo caso el contenido de los cmdbed es valorado con posterioridad por los profesionales de los registros de mortalidad permitiendo modificaciones de la causa fundamental tras el estudio de la historia clínica la comunicación en su caso con el profesional que en su momento hubiera certificado el fallecimiento el documento del cgcom se basaba en la guía internacional de la oms para la certificación del covid<NUMBER> que posteriormente se ha modificado en una publicación del <NUMBER> de abril de <NUMBER> que recoge ejemplos para la certificación de muertes covid<NUMBER> <NUMBER> en cuanto la codificación de las muertes la oms establece el código u<NUMBER> para los fallecimientos por covid<NUMBER> confirmados mediante estudio analítico u<NUMBER> para los fallecimientos sin test confirmatorios en los que el diagnostico se basa en criterios clínicos yo epidemiológicos de covid<NUMBER> probable sospechoso <NUMBER> los efectos de toma de decisiones define diferencia casos sospechosos probables este documento define en los que sobreviven la enfermedad como caso probable mientras exista comunicación telemática puede ser útil establecer procedimientos excepcionales como el que se ha establecido en castilla la mancha <NUMBER> otras propuestas como la participación de los institutos de medicina legal ciencias forenses imlcf en sistemas específicos de vigilancia de la mortalidad permitiría conocer en tiempo real los fallecimientos sus causas en circunstancias tan excepcionales como las vividas esta participación se sustenta en la supervisión de los cmdbed que realizan los médicos forenses en funciones de médicos del rc en algunos imlcf en españa este cpmetido generalmente circunscrito los grandes municipios podría ampliarse al control de los cmdbed recibidos en todas las oficinas de rc de esa comunidad así los imlcf trasladarían diariamente la información de los cmdbed los servicios de salud pública de cada comunidad esta participación que se ha llevado cabo de manera exitosa en castilla león aportaría un gran valor añadido los circuitos de notificación habituales desde el punto de vista práctico debemos poder contar con suficientes certificados de defunción certificados los que se tiene acceso en los com provinciales ante una situación de pandemia especialmente con medidas de confinamiento se deben prever mecanismos de remisión rápidos sencillos entre los com los servicios funerarios yo asistenciales como conclusión señalamos que la cumplimentación del cmdbed es un acto médico trascendente que requiere una valoración integral de la patobiografía del paciente que ayuda humanizar el trato las familias en circunstancias de padecimiento emocional intensas se debe mejorar los métodos de comunicación de la mortalidad estableciendo la posibilidad de certificación telemática en circunstancias de epidemias pandemias es

die durch schlecht gemanagte veränderungen z b fusionen hervorgerufen werden können ein gutes changemanagement gehört für jedes unternehmen zum pflichtprogramm der vergangenheit bzw gegenwart haben sich folgende branchen als besonders krisenanfällig gezeigt gesundheitpharma chemie lebensmittel energie fleischerzeugung versicherungenbanken luftfahrt automobil aufgrund der globalisierung und schnelllebigkeit unserer industriegesellschaft kann eine unternehmenskrise aber auch jede andere branche jederzeit treffen die ursachen und wechselwirkungen die zu einer unternehmenskrise führen können sind komplex und lassen sich der regel auf die summe verschiedener interner und externer ereignisse und entwicklungen zurückführen unternehmenskrisen können entstehen durch zahlreiche beispiele aus der vergangenheit haben aufgezeigt dass ereignisse mit krisenpotenzial erst durch die medien zu krisen gemacht wurden nur wenige unternehmen verfügen jedoch über professionelle pläne die auch den aspekt der krisenkommunikation berücksichtigen fehler bei der kommunikation können ein kritisches ereignis drastisch verschlimmern primäres ziel der krisenkommunikation ist die aufklärung der öffentlichkeit und der medien und der direkt betroffenen gruppen bezüglich der krise des weiteren versucht das unternehmen der öffentlichkeit und den medien zu vermitteln dass es alles mögliche unternimmt um größere schäden abzuwenden und die situation wieder unter kontrolle zu bekommen abb <NUMBER> öffentlichkeitsarbeit während der krise information wird sofort und ohne verzögerung weitergeben innerhalb der ersten zwei stunden eine pressekonferenz einberufen und das sofort ankündigen informationsstrom nicht abbrechen lassen gerade die erste information der medien und somit der öffentlichkeit innerhalb der ersten stunde benötigt eine möglichst hohe effizienz und effektivität kommunikationsmaßnahmen bzw instrument müssen perfekt aufeinander abgestimmt eingesetzt werden alleine daraus ergibt sich dass die krisenkommunikation im vorfeld proaktiv vorbereitet werden muss oft ist es sinnvoll sich dafür mit profis verbindung zu setzen eine möglichkeit der optimalen abstimmung der einzelnen instrumente ist die orientierung den sechs krisenws ist passiert und wird unternommen wer wird informiert bzw einbezogen wie kann das vertrauen erhalten bzw wiedererlangt werden wann wird die öffentlichkeit informiert warum kam es zur krise wo wird stellung genommen tipp eine effektive und effiziente krisenkommunikation ist unbedingt erforderlich und sollte im vorfeld von profis vorbereitet werden leider reicht es nicht mehr aus nur finanztechnische kennzahlen zur früherkennung von unternehmenskrisen heranzuziehen immer mehr unternehmen realisieren dass die traditionelle krisenprävention den gestiegenen ansprüchen nicht mehr genügt wie auch zahlreiche studien belegen angesichts der härter werdenden wettbewerbsbedingungen macht es sinn auch mehr aktivitäten die technische krisenprävention zu investieren hierzu gehören insbesondere das durchspielen von worstcaseszenarien das aufzeigen von bottle necks der produktion die kontinuierliche durchführung angemessener instandhaltungsmaßnahmen sowie die einführung eines issue profiling für arbeitsmittel diesem zusammenhang muss das zentrale präventionsinstrument gefährdungsbeurteilung gemäß arbeitsschutzgesetz arbschg betriebssicherheitsverordnung betrsichv und weiterer verordnungen besser von den unternehmen angenommen und genutzt werden hier geht es noch um potenzielle krisen dieser phase befindet sich das unternehmen noch im normalzustand und es gibt noch keine den unternehmensintern zu bestimmenden kennzahlen wahrnehmbaren krisensymptome die zentrale aufgabe des antizipativen krisenmanagements ist die gedankliche vorbereitung auf mögliche krisen man muss hier den mut haben das undenkbare zu denken sehr häufig ist hier im vorfeld ein geeignetes issues management hilfreich das präventive krisenmanagement bezieht sich auf die zweite phase des krisenprozesses der latenten unternehmenskrise die krisensymptome sind teilweise noch verdeckt die kennzahlen liefern aber bereits den erhärteten verdacht dass bereits eine gefährdung der erfolgspotenziale vorliegt die krise ist bereits eingetreten und das unternehmen ist sich dessen auch bewusst sie ist aber noch beherrschbar die zentrale aufgabe ist die erfolgreiche zurückschlagung und die daraus folgende bewältigung der unternehmenskrise dies ist die letzte phase die krise nicht mehr beherrschbar und führt zur katastrophe es kann zu einer möglichen liquidation des unternehmens kommen tipp alle organisationseinheiten eines unternehmens haben die erforderlichen maßnahmen zu ergreifen um den eintritt einer krise zu verhindern krisenprävention bzw beim eintreten einer krise negative auswirkungen für das unternehmen weit wie möglich einzugrenzen eines der instrumente des antizipatives krisenmanagements ist das issues management dies ist bereits seit den <NUMBER>er jahren des vorherigen jahrhunderts den usa ein wichtiges managementthema und findet seit ende der <NUMBER>er jahre im europäischen raum ebenfalls anwendung diese bezeichnung issue entstammt dem angelsächsischen sprachraum eine wörtliche übersetzung ins deutsche wäre thema angelegenheit etc darunter versteht man diesem zusammenhang insbesondere ein thema öffentlichen interesses mit hohem konfliktpotenzial issues management dient als früherkennungssystem für schwache signale aus dem unternehmensumfelds der vater des konzepts der amerikanische prberater william howard chase definiert issuesmanagement um <NUMBER> herum wie folgt issues management capacity understand mobilize coordinate direct strategic policy planning functions public affairspublic relations skills toward achievement one objective meaningful participation creation public policy affects personal institutional destiny durch das issues management hat ein unternehmen oder organisation also die möglichkeit schnell flexibel und vor allem sensibel auf jede nachricht und entwicklung zu reagieren die für die identität und wahrnehmung der unternehmensmarke wichtig ist und bei nichtbeachtung krisenpotenzial entwickeln kann das issue management lässt sich dabei fünf phasen unterteilen scanning die identifikation von issues als grundlegende und somit fast schon wichtigste phase issues monitoring analyse und beobachtung der öffentlichen meinung und medien strategic issue diagnosis die strategische prüfung und einstufung message formating wahl der grundlegenden reaktionantwort auf strategische issues hierbei kann noch mal zwischen einem proaktivem und reaktivem vorgehen unterschieden werden incorporation strategic plan integration die strategische planung issues durchlaufen im öffentliche fokus einen lebenszyklus je weiter das issue seinem lebenszyklus voranschreitet desto geringer wird gleichzeitig die einflussmöglichkeit des betroffenen unternehmens den usa gilt das issues management mittlerweile als selbstverständlichkeit deutschland hingegen hinkt man dieser entwicklung noch hinterher über geeignete und im notfall auch sofort zur verfügung stehende dokumentationen verfahrenanweisungen notfallpläne gefahrenabwehrpläne gap einer entsprechend ausgelegten infrastruktur spezifischer instrumente und auch mit hilfe von personelle ressourcen muss ein notfallmanagementsystem den das krisenmanagement implementiert und manifestiert werden elektronische softwaregesteuerte notfallmanagementsysteme können den mitarbeitern helfen schnell zu reagieren es muss aber unbedingt beachtet werden das die von der energieversorgung abhängig und diese im notfall ausfallen kann das notfallmanagement muss den mitarbeitern also auch ausgedruckter version zur verfügung stehen um auf notfälle vorbereitet zu sein empfehlen sich regelmäßige notfallübungen und räumungsübungen diese können neben dem sicherstellen des prinzipiellen funktionierens des notfallmanagements auch erkenntnisse liefern welche optimierungspotenziale noch ungenutzt sind dabei sollten die übungsszenarien realitätsnah wie möglich geplant und durchgeführt werden um alle parameter des notfallplans zu überprüfen die funktionalität und effektivität von organisatorischen personellen und materiellen vorkehrungen aber auch die qualifikationen des einsatzund hilfspersonals ein typisches notfallszenario ist ein großbrand im betrieb anlagen und gebäude können nach einem brandschaden mit mehr oder weniger großem aufwand instand gesetzt zerstörte betriebsund arbeitsmittel neu beschafft werden die beeinträchtigung der gesundheit oder gar der verlust von menschlichem leben durch den brand und seine nebenwirkungen wiegen dagegen ungleich schwerer als der sachschaden nach angaben des gesamtverbandes der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft e v ergibt sich für großschäden der industriellen sachversicherung folgende statistik der brandschäden für die jahre <NUMBER> bis <NUMBER> tab <NUMBER> der obigen aufstellung wurden nur schäden mit einem schadenaufwand von mindestens <NUMBER> c bis <NUMBER> <NUMBER> mio dm berücksichtigt zwar ist die anzahl der großschadensereignisse tendenziell rückläufig jedoch stieg im gleichen zeitraum die durchschnittliche schadenssumme deutlich sachschäden durch brände wurden der vergangenheit zwar seltener dafür aber auch deutlich teurer aus praktischen erwägungen sollten alle oben aufgeführten eventuell auftretenden gefährdungen separat aufgelistet und bewertet werden die anforderungen die struktur der fluchtund rettungswege sowie der dazugehörigen pläne ergeben sich aus der technischen regel für arbeitsstätten asr a<NUMBER> fluchtwege und notausgänge fluchtund rettungsplan vom <NUMBER> august <NUMBER> und sind meistens sollten bereits der planungsphase von architekten und genehmigungsbehörden berücksichtigt worden grundsätzlich ist immer dann eine sicherheitsbeleuchtung vorzusehen wenn das arbeitsstättenrecht oder das baurecht diese vorschreiben darüber hinaus kann die gefährdungsbeurteilung weitere anwendungsfälle sowohl für die sicherheitsbeleuchtung als auch bodennahe sicherheitsleitsysteme ergeben bei möglicher verrauchung ist im allgemeinen ein bodennahes sicherheitsleitsystem erforderlich dieses kann grundsätzlich entweder elektrisch oder auch lang nachleuchtend ausgeführt werden die gefährdungsermittlung kann auch ergeben dass kombinationen unterschiedlicher sicherheitsleitsysteme erforderlich sind im allgemeinen kann davon ausgegangen werden dass bei hoher personenbelegungsdichte der einsatz eines elektrisch betriebenen systems vorteilhaft ist bei geringer personenbelegungsdichte kann ein lang nachleuchtendes system ausreichen die anforderungen sicherheitsleitsysteme ergeben sich für den landbereich aus der normenreihe din <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> deutsche industrie norm für langnachleuchtende pigmente und produkte bgv <NUMBER> sicherheitsund gesundheitsschutzkennzeichnung arbeitsplatz und bgr <NUMBER> optische sicherheitsleitsysteme folgende anforderungen müssen von einem sicherheitsleitsystem grundsätzlich erfüllt werden zuverlässig funktioniert auch bei stromausfall sichtbar auch bei starker verqualmung deutlich erkennbar und auch nach vielen stunden noch zu erkennen lückenlos durchgehende markierung bis zum nächstgelegenen notausgang insbesondere sonderbauten mit einer vielzahl von personen ist der regel ein zweiter baulicher rettungsweg erforderlich die rettung einer vielzahl von personen über das rettungsgerät der feuerwehr ist nicht angemessener zeit möglich um die sich im gebäude befindlichen personen die lage zu versetzen sich schnell und sicher orientieren zu können müssen fluchtund rettungspläne erstellt werden die eine möglichst einfache darstellung der baulichen gegebenheiten sowie eine unproblematische lesbarkeit aufweisen grundlage der fluchtund rettungspläne ist die arbeitsstättenverordnung arbstättv auch wenn es derzeit nicht direkt gesetzlich vorgeschrieben ist hat sich der praxis die bestellung von brandschutzbeauftragten bewährt der brandschutzbeauftragte sollte eine mehrjährige praxis im vorbeugenden brandschutz besitzen undoder eine ausreichende ausbildung im vorbeugenden brandschutz haben vergleichbar den fachkräften für arbeitssicherheit sollte der brandschutzbeauftragte unmittelbar der leitung des werkes oder betriebes unterstellt sein für dessen brandschutz er zuständig ist zu allen den brandschutz betreffenden fragen des unternehmens auch bei der planung sollte er gehört werden zu seinen aufgaben und pflichten gehört das erkennen von gefahren sowie ihre beurteilung er hat dafür zu sorgen dass sie beseitigt und schäden möglichst gering gehalten werden unter den bedingungen die bei einem brand herrschen kann aus unbedenklichen stoffen gelagerten gegenständen arbeitsmitteln z b kopierer oder bauteilen eine vielfalt verbrennungsprodukten und rückständen entstehen deren gefahrenpotenzial nur sehr schwierig einzuschätzen ist mit den daraus folgenden anforderungen den umweltschutz die sicherheit und den gesundheitsschutz der personen die die sanierungsarbeiten den brandstellen durchführen befasst sich die gdvrichtlinien zur brandschadensanierung vds <NUMBER> <NUMBER> die vds schadenverhütung ist ein unternehmen des gesamtverbandes der deutschen versicherungswirtschaft gdv die richtlinien vds <NUMBER> wurde im oktober <NUMBER> neu strukturiert und grundlegend überarbeitet sie berücksichtigen die vorgehensweisen und schutzkonzepte der gefahrstoffund biostoffverordnung sowie der zugeordneten technischen regeln zur gefährdungsbeurteilung trgs <NUMBER> gefährdungsbeurteilung für tätigkeiten mit gefahrstoffen trba <NUMBER> handlungsanleitung zur gefährdungsbeurteilung und für die unterrichtung der beschäftigten bei tätigkeiten mit biologischen arbeitsstoffen etc und die festlegung von schutzmaßnahmen zusätzlich berücksichtigen die richtlinien die aufgaben und verantwortlichkeiten die sich aus der baustellenverordnung und der bgr <NUMBER> arbeiten kontaminierten bereichen ergeben demnach entspricht die richtlinien vds <NUMBER> <NUMBER> einer der ersten schritte ist die unverzügliche meldung des schadenfalles den zuständigen versicherer insbesondere bei bränden mit höherem gefahrenpotenzial kann dies entscheidenden einfluss auf die gesamte schadenabwicklung haben diese frühzeitige meldung des schadenfalles versetzt den versicherer die lage rechtzeitig zu reagieren und dadurch u sicherzustellen dass eine rasche und qualifizierte beurteilung der schadensituation vor ort durch den versicherer veranlasst werden kann abb <NUMBER> vor beginn der sanierungsarbeiten sind unterschiedliche bewertungen vorzunehmen und entscheidungen zu treffen der regel hat der betroffene hierzu professionelle hilfe wie etwa durch den versicherer durch sachverständige oder sanierungsunternehmen nötig nur mit dieser hilfe kann das unternehmen schnellstmöglich wieder die produktion aufnehmen und den verlust von vertrauen und einen imageschaden verhindern letztendlich könnte dies auch zum verlust der kunden und somit der wirtschaftlichen grundlage führen auf basis der erstbegehung durch die experten erfolgt die einteilung der brandstelle die gefahrenbereiche allen betrieben und auf baustellen muss erstehilfematerial bereitgehalten werden geeignetes erstehilfematerial ist z b im kleinen verbandkasten nach din <NUMBER> sowie im großen verbandkasten nach din <NUMBER> enthalten abhängigkeit von der betriebsart und zahl der versicherten gelten für die ausstattung mit verbandkästen die der folgenden tabelle aufgeführten richtwerte die verbandkästen sollen auf die arbeitsstätten verteilt sein dass sie von ständigen arbeitsplätzen höchstens <NUMBER> wegstrecke oder höchstens eine geschosshöhe entfernt sind sie sollen überall dort aufbewahrt werden wo die arbeitsbedingungen dies erfordern im zuge der globalisierung verstärken immer mehr unternehmen ihr auslandsgeschäft die zahl der auslandseinsätze der mitarbeiter nimmt ständig zu jedoch werden die risiken die damit verbunden sind häufig einfach ausgeblendet es wird zu oft leichtfertig mit dem höchsten gut eines unternehmens den mitarbeitern umgegangen obwohl die risiken ständig zunehmen unternehmen die mitarbeiter ins ausland entsenden müssen regionsabhängig stets mit naturereignissen wie erdbeben seuchen wie sars vogelgrippe oder denguefieber terror und kriminellen akten wie bombenanschlägen oder entführungen rechnen erstaunlich sei auch dass unternehmen sich häufig nur um das visum und die schutzimpfungen des entsendungspersonals kümmern nicht aber um eine umfassende sicherheitsvorsorge dabei umfasst ein gutes basisschutzpaket weitaus mehr aspekte die richtige personalauswahl vor der entsendung die arbeitsmedizinische vorsorgeuntersuchung incl reisemedizinischer beratung die einweisung das jeweilige land und dessen landesspezifischen gefahren die unterstützung bei der unterkunftssuche die auswahl geeigneter kontaktpersonen vor ort und eine gesicherte ansprechbarkeit der unternehmens rund um die uhr müssen unbedingt berücksichtigt werden für den ernstfall sind jedoch noch zu wenig unternehmen professionell vorbereitet sie verlassen sich offensichtlich nur auf die geschicke des außenministeriums die pandemieplanung hat inzwischen auch viele betriebe erreicht für die weltgesundheitsorganisation ist der ausbruch einer grippepandemie nur eine frage der zeit experten rechnen damit dass diesem fall rund <NUMBER> der arbeitnehmer ausfallen eine pandemie ist eine weltumspannende epidemie erste pandemien sind bereits seit der antoninischen pest ca <NUMBER> n chr tatsächlich belegt neben einer durch influenzaviren verursachten pandemie zählt z b auch aids zu dieser kategorie das seit <NUMBER> bisher etwa <NUMBER> mio todesopfer forderte im <NUMBER> jahrhundert ereigneten sich drei influenzapandemien die spanische grippe <NUMBER> bis zu <NUMBER> mio tote die asiatische grippe <NUMBER> ca <NUMBER> mio tote und die hong kong grippe <NUMBER> mit etwa <NUMBER> toten basis einer rationalen planung ist ein gutes verständnis der saisonalen aviären und pandemischen influenza die trennung dieser entitäten ist wichtig gerade weil sie der öffentlichkeit nicht immer klar vollzogen wird seit <NUMBER> zirkulieren viren zweier influenza subtypen h<NUMBER> und h<NUMBER> sowie des typs b der menschlichen bevölkerung und rufen die saisonale grippe hervor der anteil der virustypen bzw subtypen den influenzaerkrankungen schwankt von jahr zu jahr die saison <NUMBER> war z b von influenza bviren dominiert und relativ schwach während der saison <NUMBER> influenza ah<NUMBER>n<NUMBER>viren vorherrschten und eine viel stärkere und für das gesundheitssystem folgenreichere grippewelle verursachten typischerweise baut sich eine saisonale welle häufig im süden beginnend wenigen wochen auf bevor ganz deutschland erfasst ist die hierbei handele es sich um optimistische schätzungen da man hierbei von einer pathogenität der honk konggrippe ausgegangen ist und nicht von der höheren pathogenität der spanischen grippe welcher betrieb kann einen hohen ausfall im bereich human ressources verkraften wie viele betriebe haben sich darauf vorbereitet wer denkt auch die angehörigen seiner mitarbeiter kein familienvater wird dieser situation mit seinen gedanken im betrieb sein wenn er überhaupt zur arbeit kommt siehe anlage

übersetzen lässt sich scm mit dem management von versorgungsketten lieferketten bzw wertschöpfungsketten daran wird sofort erkennbar welches krisenpotenzial hier zu finden ist durch das issues

voranschreitet desto geringer wird gleichzeitig die einflussmöglichkeit des betroffenen unternehmens den usa gilt das issues management mittlerweile als selbstverständlichkeit deutschland hingegen hinkt man dieser entwicklung noch hinterher im zeitalter des internets bieten spezialisierte firmen z bereits ein professionelles onlinemonitoring sie durchsuchen dabei regelmäßig im auftrag ihres kunden das internet nach bestimmten begriffen und begriffskombinationen die den interessenbereich des kunden fallen und können frühzeitig auf entwicklungen mit krisenpotenzial hinweisen nach angaben des prtrendmonitor september <NUMBER> faktenkontor gmbh führten <NUMBER> bis <NUMBER> der pressestellen bzw agenturen bereits ein regelmäßiges webmonitoring für ihre unternehmen bzw kunden durch die gleiche studie ergab dass die pressestellen und agenturen die social media allgemein als aktuelle topno<NUMBER>herausforderung auch für sich selbst ansahen auch kleine und mittlere unternehmen sollten zumindest die regionalen medien und fachzeitschriften ihrer branche regelmäßig beobachten es ist kein großer aufwand sich von einem mitarbeiter des unternehmens einen wöchentlichen pressespiegel zusammenzustellen zu lassen zu allen relevanten themen die das unternehmen betreffen heutzutage hat fast jedes unternehmen eine eigene internetpräsenz abb <NUMBER> viele nutzen diese präsenzen auch um krisensituationen schnell reagieren zu können krisen laufen fast immer unter einem enormen zeitdruck ab unternehmen sollten daher schon im normalzustand im rahmen ihrer krisenprävention z b genannte darksites vorbereiten abb <NUMBER> hierbei handelt es sich um webseiten mit hintergrundinformationen über das unternehmen und seine produkte die im krisenfall freigeschaltet werden der wert solcher dark sites ergibt sich aus unterschiedlichen aspekten einerseits können sich journalisten anwohner und die öffentlichkeit unmittelbar über die ereignisse informieren andererseits dokumentiert das unternehmen durch die schnelle reaktion im internet dass es die ereignisse ernst nimmt der verdacht etwas würde verharmlost und vertuscht kommt somit gar nicht erst auf auch bekommen die journalisten futter sie brauchen sich keine informationen ausdenken sondern können auf fertige texte und bilder zurückgreifen klassiker wie die suchmaschine google beschreiten der krisenkommunikation neue interaktive wege nach dem verheerenden erdbeben japan wurden etliche menschen vermisst und mit dem person finder konnte vielen geholfen werden informationen über den aufenthaltsort oder gesundheitszustand der vermissten erfahrung zu bringen httpgoogleorgpersonfinderglobalhomehtml dieses beispiel zeigt welche innovativen möglichkeiten sich auch im katastrophenschutz durch die neuen anwendungen bieten zwischenfälle die betriebsabläufe stören oder unternehmen schädigen treten häufig auf notfälle ereignen sich seltener katastrophen sind die ausnahme außergewöhnliche ereignisse können ein unternehmen jederzeit treffen sie können plötzlich eintreten oder sich langsam anbahnen man kann sich von ihnen überraschen lassen oder man kann glauben darauf vorbereitet zu sein die auswirkungen können beiden fällen verheerend sein viele unternehmen sind auf unerwartete ereignisse nicht ausreichend vorbereitet beim eintritt eines ernstfalls sind nicht nur technische anlagen und die funktionsfähigkeit des unternehmens bedroht sondern auch das leben von menschen zwischenfälle notfälle und katastrophen wie zum beispiel naturereignisse sabotageakte oder terroranschläge treten unterschiedlicher ausprägung zu jeder tagesund nachtzeit sowie meist vollkommen unerwartet auf nicht immer kann man alle ursachen vorhersehen wohl aber deren folgen für das unternehmen die auswirkungen von notfällen und katastrophen können für unternehmen erheblich sein und im schlimmsten fall zu einer existenzbedrohenden krise führen ein krisenmanagement ist optimal um sich und seine
