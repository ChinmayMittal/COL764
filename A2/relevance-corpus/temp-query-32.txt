c oronaviruses, categorized into the order nidovirales, family coronaviridae, and subfamily coronavirinae, are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range 1 . their infections in humans, other mammals, and birds can cause respiratory, hepatic, enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity 2 . the zoonotic transmission of novel coronaviruses into humans poses severe threats to the global health, evidenced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), and the sars-cov-2 that is causing the ongoing pandemic covid-19 in the world 1,3-6 . in the meantime, coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic losses 7 . for example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (sads-cov) (also known as seacov and peav) isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90% in several commercial pig farms in guangdong province of china [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . sads-cov is an αcoronavirus and other representative members in the α-genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (tgev), porcine respiratory coronavirus (prcv), feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv), and human nl63 and 229e coronaviruses (hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e) 1 . representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis coronavirus (mhv), bovine coronavirus (bcov), sars-cov, sars-cov-2, mers-cov, hcov-oc43, and hcov-hku1 in the β-genus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) in the γ-genus, and porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) in the δ-genus 1 .cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination and/or mutations underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses 3, [14] [15] [16] . bats are the natural reservoir of more than 30 different αand β-coronaviruses that have great potential for interspecies transmission by recombination and/or mutation 15, [17] [18] [19] . data on genetic evolution, receptor binding, and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human sars-cov and mers-cov most likely originate from bats 1 . palm civets and dromedary camels are the intermediate hosts of sars-cov and mers-cov from bats to humans, respectively 1 . the newly identified porcine sads-cov isolates are also found to sharẽ 95% sequence identity with rhinolophus bat coronavirus hku2, and this further stressed the severe results of coronavirus spillover from bats to domestic animals [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of sads-cov from bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored.recently it was shown that sads-cov is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse, chicken, pig, monkey, and human, indicating a high potential of the sads-cov for interspecies transmission 20 .the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host receptor with the s1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the s2 subunit, thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism 21, 22 . as a class i viral fusion protein, the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits 21 . for most coronaviruses, the n-terminal domain (ntd) of the s1 subunit recognizes cellsurface carbohydrates, while the c-terminal domain (ctd) specifically binds to cellular protein receptors [21] [22] [23] . sars-cov, sars-cov-2, and hcov-nl63 utilize ctd to bind human receptor ace2 [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ; mers-cov utilizes ctd to bind human receptor dpp4 31, 32 ; and tgev, prcv, and 229e utilize ctd to bind receptor apn [33] [34] [35] ; hcov-oc43 utilizes ntd to recognize glycans 36 ; and one exception is mhv, which utilizes the ntd to bind mouse receptor ceacam1a 37, 38 . therefore, the s1 subunit, especially its ntd and ctd, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible for different tropisms of coronaviruses. in comparison, the s2 subunit containing the fusion peptide (fp) and heptad repeats (hr1 and hr2) for membrane fusion are more conserved in both sequence and structure 21, 22 . for the sads-cov, receptor analysis indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ace2, dpp4, and apn are essential for cell entry 10, 20 . there are also no reports regarding the recognition of glycans by the ntd of sads-cov.structural studies of the spike and its binding with glycans and protein receptors have provided important insights into the origin, evolution, and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses. cryo-em structures of spike trimer from all four coronavirus genera have been reported: the α-coronavirus spike structures are determined for hcov-nl63 39 , hcov-229e 34 , pedv 40 , and fipv 41 ; the β-coronavirus spike structures are determined for mhv 38, 42, 43 , hcov-hku1 44 , hcov-oc43 36 , sars-cov 24,45-47 , mers-cov 45, 48, 49 , and sars-cov-2 50, 51 ; and the γ-coronavirus spike structure is determined for ibv 52 and the δ-coronavirus spike structure is determined for pdcov 53, 54 . the cryo-em structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported, and only crystal structures of the ctd from hku4 55 , hku5 56 , and hku9 57 were determined.the spikes of sads-cov (1130 amino acid residues) and hku2 (1128 amino acid residues) are among the shortest coronavirus spike glycoproteins 58 and their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28%, indicating the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov are unique [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 59 . in this study, we report the cryo-em structures of the sads-cov and hku2 spike trimers at 2.83 and 2.38 å resolution, respectively. the hku2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat coronavirus. we analyze the hku2 and sads-cov trimer structures and also compare the ntd, ctd, sd1, and sd2 domains of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit of hku2 with other spikes from α-, β-, γ-, and δ-coronaviruses. our results strongly support that hku2 and sads-cov preserve primitive structural features in their spikes that have a close evolutionary relationship with βcoronavirus spikes and provide insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.protein expression and structure determination. the cdnas encoding hku2 spike (yp_001552236) and sads-cov spike (avm41569.1) were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression. hku2 ectodomains (residues 1-1066) and sads-cov ectodomains (residues 1-1068) were separately cloned into pfastbac-dual vector (invitrogen) with c-terminal foldon tag and strep tag. after expression in hi5 insect cells and purification to homogeneity, the cryo-em images on these two spike ectodomains were recorded using fei titan krios microscope operating at 300 kv with a gatan k2 summit direct electron detector ( supplementary fig. 1 ). about 1,400,000 particles for hku2 spike and 900,000 particles for sads-cov spike were subjected to 2d classification, and a total of 421,490 particles of hku2 spike and 152,334 particles of sads-cov spike were selected and subjected to 3d refinement with c3 symmetry to generate density maps ( supplementary fig. 2 table 1 .overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes. the overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes we determined here resemble the previously reported prefusion structures of coronaviruses spikes. both spike trimers have a mushroom-like shape (~150 å in height and~115 å in width) (fig. 1a) , consisting of a cap mainly formed by β-sheets of the s1 subunit, a central stalk mainly formed by α-helices of the s2 subunit, and a root formed by twisted β-sheets and loops of the s2 subunit (fig. 1a) . in each trimer there is a c3 axis along the central stalk (fig. 1a) . the amino acid identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 86%, and these two spike structures are quite similar with the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) being 0.53 å for 962 aligned cα atoms of the monomer and 0.56 å for 2886 aligned cα atoms of the trimer. due to the high structural similarity, we will use the hku2 structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description, whereas significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary.the s1 subunit of the hku2 spike comprises two major domains, ntd and ctd, which are followed by two subdomains 1 and 2 (sd1 and sd2) connecting them to the s2 subunit (fig. 1b, c) . the s1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike, in which the three ctds in the inner part are at the apex sitting on top of the central stalk and the three ntds are located outside the ctds surrounding the central stalk (fig. 1a) . the ntd, ctd, sd1, and sd2 of the s1 subunit are all mainly composed of β strands (fig. 1c) . in contrast, the upstream helix (uh), fp, connecting region (cr), heptad repeat 1 (hr1), and central helix (ch) of the s2 subunit are mainly composed of helices, whereas the β-hairpin (bh) and subdomain 3 (sd3) at the bottom part of the s2 subunit mainly consist of β strands and loops (fig. 1c) . moreover, the residues after the sd3, which contain the heptad repeat 2 (hr2), are not resolved in the hku2 and sads-cov spike structures, as well as in all other reported coronavirus spike structures in the prefusion state.the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit are highly similar in amino acid sequence (85, 84, and 95% identities) and structure (cα r.m.s.d. less than 0.5 å) between hku2 and sads-cov spikes ( supplementary fig. 6 ). the ntd has the lowest sequence identity of 70% among all domains. structural superimposition also gave a higher cα r.m.s.d. value of 1.2 å between these two ntds. the core β-sheet structure is structurally conserved and conformational variations reside in the loops (supplementary fig. 6a ). the ctd sequence identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 82%, and the cα r.m.s.d. between these two ctds is 1.1 å, also indicating more structural variations in the ctd in comparison with the highly conserved sd1, sd2, and s2 subunit. the ntd and ctd of the s1 subunit are commonly utilized by coronaviruses for binding cell-surface carbohydrates or protein receptors for cell attachment 23 . therefore, the sequence and/or structural variations indicate that hku2 and sads-cov would also bind different host receptors by ntd and/or ctd of the s1 subunit, although their receptors in bat and pig are unknown and the receptor-binding sites on spike have not been defined.ntd structure and comparisons. the ntd of hku2 has three layers of antiparallel β-sheet with the top one consisting of six strands, the middle one consisting of five strands, and the bottom one consisting of three strands. below the bottom sheet is a short α-helix (fig. 2a) . the top and middle β-sheets form a galectin-like β-sandwich fold, which is inserted between two strands of the bottom sheet (fig. 2a) . to supplement, three disulfide bonds are detected in the hku2 ntd structure: c 17 -c 56 connecting the nterminus of the ntd to its upper loop, c 124 -c 149 connecting β6 and β7 strands in the top sheet, and c 234 -c 244 connecting the bottom helix to the bottom sheet (fig. 2a) .although the ntds of all coronaviruses adopt a similar overall architecture, the ntd of hku2 has the highest structural similarity with the ntd1 (named domain 0 in previous reports) of α-coronavirus hcov-nl63 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.7 å for 186 aligned cα atoms ( fig. 2b and supplementary fig. 8d ). the ntd1 of α-coronavirus pedv is not completely modeled in the spike trimer structure; however, the partial model still fits well with the ntd of hku2 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.3 å for 73 aligned cα atoms. both hcov-nl63 and pedv have a second ntd (ntd2, also named domain a in previous reports), and the ntd of hku2 is structurally less similar to the ntd2 with an r.m.s.d. of 4.3 å against hcov-nl63 ntd2 and of 4.1 å against pedv ntd2 ( fig. 2b and supplementary fig. 8d ). recent structural represented by the ntd of hcov-229e, the ntd2s of hcov-nl63 and pedv (fig. 2b, c) . although sharing an overall architecture, these two ntd subtypes have a structural difference in the galectin-like β-sandwich fold containing the top and middle sheets stacked together through hydrophobic interactions. these two β-sheets are well aligned in the galectin-like domain of subtype i, whereas there is an alignment shift in the galectin-like domain of subtype ii (fig. 2b) . the other notable difference is the distribution of signature disulfide bonds. a signature disulfide bond c 124 -c 149 (numbered in hku2 and connecting β6 and β7 strands in the top sheet) is conserved in all subtype i ntds (fig. 2b) , and the subtype ii ntds have two signature disulfide bonds: the first one c 145 -c 168 (numbered in hcov-229e) connecting β5 and β6 strands and the second one c 81 -c 105 (numbered in hcov-229e) connecting β2 and neighbor loop (fig. 2c) . besides, c 234 -c 244 (numbered in hku2 and connecting the bottom helix to the bottom sheet) is conserved in both subtype i and subtype ii ntds (fig. 2b, c) . the ntds of β-coronaviruses including bcov, hcov-hku1, hcov-oc43, mers-cov, sars-cov, and mhv resemble the subtype i, rather than the subtype ii ntd in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds (fig. 2d) . these β-coronavirus ntds have additional loops in the n-terminus, between β1 and β2 strands, and between β6 and β7 strands (numbered in hku2 structure), forming an extensive ceiling-like structure on top of the galectin-like fold (fig. 2d) . it has been found that the evolvement of this ceiling-like structure has functional outcomes such as immune evasion or receptor binding 52 . the ntd of γcoronavirus ibv also resemble the subtype i ntd in the topology, although its disulfide bond positions are not conserved as in the subtype i ntd (fig. 2e) . of note, the ntd of δcoronavirus pdcov resemble the subtype ii ntd in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds (fig. 2f) . both ibv and pdcov ntds also have additional insertions including loops and short helices in the galectin-like fold compared with the two subtypes of ntd in α-coronaviruses (fig. 2e, f) .ctd structure and comparisons. the ctd of hku2 has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet as the core with connecting loops between the strands (fig. 3a) . it contains four disulfide bonds: c 277 -c 300 and c 285 -c 290 at the n-terminus, c 341 -c 397 at the c-terminus, and the last one c 331 -c 369 connecting the β2 and β5 strands in the core β-sheet (fig. 3a) . interestingly, the ctd core of hku2 is of high structural similarity with the conserved ctd core of β-coronaviruses and the disulfide bonds in the ctd of hku2 except for c 285 -c 290 are also detected in all β-coronavirus ctds (fig. 3b ). these ctds have the core of one twisted β-sheet and here we name them as one-layer ctd subtype (fig. 3a, b) . the β-coronavirus ctds always have an insertion consisting of loops and/or strands between the β5 and β6 strands of the core (fig. 3b) . sars-cov 26 , sars-cov-2 27-30 , mers-cov 31,32 , hku4 55 , and hku5 56 have receptor-binding motif (rbm) in this insertion region responsible for binding their respective protein receptors. in the ctd of hku2, there is only one short loop between the β5 and β6 strands of the core twisted β-sheet (fig. 3a) .although as members in the α-genus, hku2, and sads-cov ctd structures are significantly different from those of other αcoronaviruses hcov-nl63, hcov-229e, pedv, tgev, and prcv that contain two layers of β-sheets (fig. 3c) . and we named these ctds as two-layer ctd subtype. all available twolayer ctd structures can be well aligned with cα r.m.s.d. in the range of 1.0-3.4 å. these two-layer ctds contain two highly conserved disulfide bonds: c 540 -c 586 and c 569 -c 596 (numbered in pedv ctd) (fig. 3c ). the c 569 -c 596 is conserved among all coronaviruses, whereas the c 540 -c 586 is conserved in all αcoronaviruses (except for hku2 and sads) and δ-coronavirus pdcov (fig. 3c) .the ctd of δ-coronavirus pdcov has a core of two β-sheets, belonging to the two-layer ctd subtype (fig. 3c) . as for the γcoronavirus ibv, the core of its ctd is also similar to the typical two-layer ctd (fig. 3c) . however, several β strands are replaced by loops and the disulfide bonds are in different positions from the two-layer ctd (fig. 3c) . ibv ctd also has an extra region of loops, reminiscent of the extra domain in the ctds of βcoronaviruses (fig. 3c) . sd1 and sd2 structures and comparisons. the sd1 and sd2 are two subdomains following the ctd in the s1 subunit, linking the ctd to the s2 subunit. the hku2 sd1 is a partial β barrel consisting of five β strands and a disulfide bond (c 409 -c 458 ) connecting its c-terminus to the β1 strand (fig. 4a) . this fivestranded β barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all four genera of coronavirus (fig. 4a) . the hku2 sd2 has a structure of two layers of β-sheet with an additional short αhelix over the top sheet (fig. 4b) . the additional α-helix and the top sheet is linked by a disulfide bond (c 482 -c 509 ), and another disulfide bond (c 524 -c 533 ) links the c-terminal loop to the bottom sheet (fig. 4b) . the two-layer core structure and the second disulfide bond are conserved among all genera of coronavirus; however, the additional α-helix and the first linking disulfide bond is a distinct feature of β-coronaviruses plus αcoronavirus hku2 and sads-cov (fig. 4b) . this additional helix appears to be an insertion between the β2 and β3 strands of the sd2, and is retained during evolution of β-coronaviruses.quaternary packing of the ntd and ctd in the spike. it has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of the s1 subunits in the trimer: intrasubunit packing and cross-subunit packing 52 . actually, this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between ntd and ctd in the spike monomer. the hku2 s1 subunit, similar to those in α-coronaviruses hcov-nl63, hcov-229e, and pedv and δ-coronavirus pdcov, has an inward ctd that contacts with the ntd (fig. 5a) . the three structural ntd-ctd modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of ntd and ctd from the same monomer, forming the intrasubunit packing in the spike trimer (fig. 5a) . the s1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the βand γ-genera including mhv, sars-cov, mers-cov, hcov-oc43, and ibv have an outward ctd that is far away from the ntd (fig. 5b) . therefore, the three structural ntd-ctd modules in the cap region of these spikes have the ntd from one monomer and the ctd from the adjacent monomer, forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer (fig. 5b) . interestingly, we found that the outward ctds always have an insertion in the core structure, such as β-coronavirus ctds and γ-coronavirus ibv ctd (fig. 5b) . in contrast, all inward ctds only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted region.conserved s2 subunit and a distinct cr. sequence analysis suggested that the s1/s2 protease cleavage site at the boundary between the s1 and s2 subunits is r544-m545 in hku2 spike and r546-m547 in sads-cov spike 8, 11, 59 . compared with the s1 subunit, the topology and structure of s2 subunit are highly conserved in all coronavirus spikes. the hku2 s2 subunit contains a 3-helix uh (residues 589-639), an fp helix (residues 672-684), a cr (residues 689-747), a 4-helix hr1 (residues 748-836), a ch (residues 837-887), a twisted bh (residues 888-929), and a β-sandwich like sd3 (residues 930-995) (figs. 1b and 6a) . like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state, the model of hr2 after sd3 was not built in the structure due to poor density. five disulfide bonds in s2 are detected. two of them (c 590 -c 612 and c 595 -c 601 ) stabilize the folded helices of uh, c 696 -c 706 bends the cr, c 884 -c 895 links the ch and the bh, and c 934 -c 943 is within the sd3 (fig. 6a) . the first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses, and the last one in the sd3 has different positions in different spikes. specifically, it links the β2 and β3 strands of sd3 in the spikes of hku2, sads-cov, and mers-cov (numbered in mers-cov), and in other coronavirus spikes it links the β2 strand to the c-terminal loop of sd3 (numbered in mers-cov) (supplementary fig. 7) .all coronavirus spikes have the s2′ protease site upstream from the fp in the s2 subunit, which is essential for proteolytic fusion activation of the spike. receptor binding and cleavage at the s2′ site promote large-scale conformational changes of the fp, cr, hr1, and hr2, allowing the insertion of fp into host cell membrane and the formation of six-helix bundle. the fp and cr, which are often not well and totally resolved in other coronavirus spike structures, can be clearly modeled in the hku2 spike due to the atomic resolution of the map (supplementary fig. 5 ). the typical cr in the s2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand, with a disulfide bond bending the first and second helix to form a turn (fig. 6b) . in hku2, the second helix is replaced by a short strand (713-716) and the third helix is replaced by a loop (721-741), therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in hku2 cr (fig. 6c) . the conserved disulfide bond c 696 -c 706 makes the first helix of cr in hku2 spike turn upside down. the s2′ cleavage site (between r671 and s672) is then covered by the reversed cr helix and loops, and r671 interacts with e723 in the loop and k697 and k698 in helix 1 (fig. 6c) . in other coronaviruses, taking the mhv s2 for example, the helix 1 does not cover the s2′ site (between r869 and s870), and r869 only loosely interacts with t929 in helix 3 (fig. 6b) . after the dissociation of the s1 subunit triggered by receptor binding, the exposure of the s2′ site for cleavage is a prerequisite for the proteolytic activation of the coronavirus spike to mediate membrane fusion. the buried s2′ site indicates that hku2 spike, compared with other coronavirus spikes, would require more conformational changes around the s2′ site for the exposure.a porcine coronavirus sads-cov (also named seacov and peav in other reports) was recently identified from suckling piglets with diarrhea in southern china, and its genome sequence was most identical (~95% identity) to that of rhinolophus bat αcoronavirus hku2 [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . the sads-cov and hku2 are phylogenetically located in a sublineage closely related to the proposed α-coronavirus group-1b lineage at the complete genome level [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . however, phylogenetic analysis based on the spike glycoprotein indicated that they are members of a separate lineage clustered within β-coronavirus ( supplementary fig. 8a) , suggesting that hku2 and sads-cov probably resulted from recombination of an α-coronavirus with an unrecognized β-coronavirus s gene [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . these results, together with the lower than 28% amino acid identities to other known coronavirus glycoproteins, strongly indicate that the spike glycoproteins of hku2 and sads-cov are unique [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . in this study, we determined the cryo-em structures hcov-229e s1 pdcov s1intra-subunit packing ibv s1 mhv s1 sars-cov s1cross-subunit packing 5 quaternary packing of ntd and ctd. a α-coronavirus s1 and δ-coronavirus s1 use intrasubunit packing pattern. ntd and ctd from the first monomer are colored blue, the second are colored red, and the third are colored magenta. pdb codes: hcov-229e, 6u7h; pdcov, 6b7n. b β-coronavirus s1 and γ-coronavirus s1 use cross-subunit packing pattern. ntd and ctd from the first monomer are colored blue, the second are colored red, and the third are colored magenta. the extra loop of ibv and the extra domains of β-covs are colored yellow and labeled as ex. pdb codes: mhv, 3jcl; ibv, 6cv0; sars, 5xlr.of hku2 and sads-cov spike glycoproteins at atomic resolutions. pairwise comparisons demonstrated nearly identical overall structures, and differences mainly locate in the loops of ntd and ctd of the s1 subunit between the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov ( supplementary fig. 6) . a series of structural analysis and comparisons were also performed at the domain level between hku2 spike with other coronavirus spikes with determined structures. our results show that hku2 and sads-cov spikes maintain primitive structural features, especially in the ntd and ctd, and provide more insights into the evolution of coronaviruses. the hku2 and sads-cov have one ntd in the s1 subunit, and their structures are more similar to the ntd1 than the ntd2 of α-coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and pedv, whereas the only ntd of hcov-229e is structurally more similar to the ntd2 than the ntd1 (fig. 2) . therefore, we suggest that αcoronaviruses have two subtypes of ntd. the evolution relationship between them are not clear yet. it was once suggested that the presence of two ntds in hcov-nl63 is a result of gene duplication 39 . however, the sequence identity between these two ntds is only 15.7% in hcov-nl63 and 12.9% in pedv. considering that hku2 (sads-cov) and hcov-229e have one ntd belonging to either subtype i or subtype ii, a more plausible evolution way of the ntd in α-coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate primitive domains into the genome, resulting in the presence of two ntds in the s1 subunit of α-coronaviruses including hcov-nl63 and pedv. of note, these two ntd subtypes may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of ntds of other genera coronaviruses. for example, in the current available spike structures, the ntds of β-coronavirus are similar to the hku2 ntd representing the subtype i in both architecture and disulfide bond positions. these β-coronavirus ntds also have additional loop ceiling over the top sheet, functionally facilitating immune evasion or protein receptor binding such as in mhv 37, 38 . the ntd of γ-coronavirus ibv is also architecturally similar to the subtype i, although the disulfide bond positions are not conserved (fig. 2e) . in contrast, the δ-coronavirus pdcov ntd is similar to the hcov-229e ntd representing the subtype ii in both architecture and disulfide bond positions (fig. 2f) . a previous study of the ibv spike proposed that α-coronavirus ntds are probably the most ancestral and the ntds of the four genera form an evolutionary spectrum in the order of α-, δ-, γ-, and β-genus 52 . our proposal here is similar to the previous one in the point that two ntd subtypes in α-coronaviruses may represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of ntds. however, we article argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of α-, δ-, γ-, and β-genus. a more plausible pathway is that the β-, γ-, and δ-coronavirus ntds may evolve independently and parallelly from subtype i (β-and γ-coronavirus ntds) or subtype ii (δcoronavirus ntds) ( supplementary fig. 8b) . the hku2 and sads-cov ctd structure has a one-layer core consisting of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. interestingly, β-coronavirus ctds also have the similar one-layer core structure and three strictly conserved disulfide bonds are also present in the core of hku2 ctd. currently, all identified rbm of β-coronavirus ctds are within an inserted domain between two strands of the core sheet, and this insertion responsible for receptor binding of β-coronaviruses is replaced by a short loop in hku2 ctd. this result firstly indicates hku2 ctd represent a primitive structure in the one-layer ctd family, while the inserted domain in β-coronaviruses results from a recombinant event during evolution (supplementary fig. 8c) . the second indication is that hku2 and sads-cov may not utilize the ctd to bind protein receptors that have not been identified yet, and their different receptor usage may be determined by the ntd that harbors almost 50% of residue difference between them. of note, the ctds from other α-coronaviruses, γ-coronavirus ibv, and δcoronavirus pdcov all belong to the two-layer subtype consisting of two layers β-sheets, although with structural variations in different viruses. these results further confirmed the previous phylogenetic analysis suggesting that hku2 and sads-cov probably resulted from a recombination of an α-coronavirus genomic backbone with an unrecognized β-coronavirus spike gene 8, 11, 59 .in contrast with the ntd and ctd having unique structural features, the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunits of hku2 and sads-cov are structurally conserved as those of other coronaviruses. in the evolutionary aspect, it is not surprising because this region either connects the ctd to the s2 subunit (sd1 and sd2) or mediates the membrane fusion (s2 subunits), whereas the ntd and ctd are key factors determining tissue tropism and host range of coronaviruses 23 . even highly conserved in overall structure, the s2 subunit in hku2 and sads-cov still have a secondary structure arrangement in the cr after the fp, resulting in a more buried s2′ cleavage site (fig. 6c) . it indicates that although the membrane fusion mechanism is highly conserved, the dynamic fusion procedures of hku2 and sads-cov may still have their unique features that need to be addressed in the future.the ongoing covid-19 pandemic caused by sars-cov-2 has raised worldwide alert [4] [5] [6] . we compared the domain structures of hku2 and sars-cov-2 s proteins ( supplementary fig. 9 ). the ntd of sars-cov-2 has the two conserved disulfide bonds in subtype i; the ctd core of sars-cov-2 has one layer of β-sheets; the sd1 and sd2 of sars-cov-2 have the same disulfide bonds with hku2, although the additional helix of sd2 is not built in the sars-cov-2 s model owing to poor density in this region. sars-cov-2 has the typical β-coronavirus structural features in each domain, and the inserted rbm in the ctd could be the major impetus for cross-species transmission from bats to human.in comparing the structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes with other coronavirus spikes, we observed that additional ntds could be recombined, ceiling loops could be inserted into ntd core, and extra domain containing rbm could be inserted into the ctd core structure. these phenomena indicate the subdomains are gradually recruited into the s1 subunit during evolution, and the recruitments are required for cross-species transmission, adapting to different host range, and responding to the updating of host immune system, which provides a vivid example for the co-evolution of virus and host.expression and purification of hku2 and sads-cov spike ectodomains. the cdnas encoding hku2 spike (yp_001552236) and sads-cov spike (avm41569.1) were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression. hku2 ectodomains (1-1066) and sads-cov ectodomains (1-1068) were separately cloned into pfastbac-dual vector (invitrogen) with c-terminal foldon tag for trimerization and strep tag for purification in the frame of ph promoter. they were expressed in hi5 insect cell using bac-to-bac baculovirus system (invitrogen). briefly, the construct was transformed into dh10bac competent cells and the extracted bacmid was transfected into sf9 cell using cellfectin ii reagent (invitrogen). the baculoviruses were harvested after 7-9 days. the high-titer viruses were generated after one more amplification that used to infect hi5 cells at a density of 1.5 × 10 6 /ml. after 60 h in culture, the cell medium containing spike ectodomains were concentrated and exchanged to binding buffer (50 mm tris, ph 8.0, 150 mm nacl). the spike ectodomains were purified by streptactin beads (iba) and then purified by gel-filtration chromatography using superose 6 gel filtration column (ge healthcare) pre-equilibrated with hbs buffer (10 mm hepes ph 7.2, 150 mm nacl). purified ectodomains were concentrated for electron microscopy analysis.cryo-electron microscopy. aliquots of spike ectodomains (4 μl, 0.33 mg/ml, in buffer containing 10 mm hepes ph 7.2, 150 mm nacl) were applied to glowdischarged holey carbon grids (quantifoil grid, au 300 mesh, r1.2/1.3). the grids were then blotted and then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using fei vitrobot system (fei).images were recorded using fei titan krios microscope operating at 300 kv with a gatan k2 summit direct electron detector (gatan inc.) at tsinghua university. the automated software (autoemation) was used to collect 7663 movies for hku2 and 4568 movies for sads-cov at ×130,000 magnification and at a defocus range between 1 and 3 μm. each movie has a total accumulate exposure of 49.784 e − /å 2 fractionated in 32 frames of 175 ms exposure. data collection statistics are summarized in table 1 .whole frames in each movie were corrected for beam-induced motion using motionco2 60 . the final image was bin averaged to give a pixel size of 1.061 å. the parameters of contrast transfer function (ctf) was estimated for each micrograph using gctf 61 . particles were automatically picked using gautomatch (http://www. mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/) and extracted using relion 62 . initially,~1,400,000 particles for hku2 and~900,000 particles for sads were subjected to 2d classification. after two or three additional 2d classifications, the best class consisting~750,000 particles (hku2) and~320,000 particles (sads-cov) were applied for creating 3d initial model, 3d refinement, and 3d classification. a total of 421,490 particles (hku2) and 152,334 particles (sads-cov) of best classes were selected and subjected to 3d refinement with c3 symmetry to generate density map. the reported resolutions based on the gold-standard fsc cutoff of 0.143 criterion were 2.38 å for hku2 spike and 2.83 å for sads-cov spike after relion post processing. local resolution variations were estimated using resmap 63 . data processing statistics are summarized in table 1 .model building and refinement. as for the hku2 spike model building, the initial model of hku2 s1 ntd was generated using the swiss-model 64 and fit into the map using ucsf chimera 65 . the other part of hku2 spike ectodomains was obtained using map to model in phenix suit 66 . as for the sads-cov spike model building, the initial model was obtained by fit hku2 s2, ntd, and ctd separately into the map using ucsf chimera 65 . manual model rebuilding was carried out using coot 67 and refined with phenix real-space refinement 66 . the quality of the final model was analyzed with molprobity 68 and emringer 69 . the validation statistics of the structural models are summarized in table 1 .reporting summary. further information on research design is available in the nature

2020;cattle production is the major agricultural sector in northern ireland (ni), producing over half of the annual agricultural output. the total cattle population in northern ireland in 2005 was 1.67 million animals, including 0.27 million animals less than 6 months of age. the total annual output in 2004 from all cattle operations was £752 million (dard statistical data 1981 -2005 . morbidity and mortality in cattle populations significantly reduce the income of cattle operations. one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in cattle is diarrheal disease. one study reported that, of the total number of mortalities in calves less than 1 month of age in northern ireland in 1992, some 18.5% were due to gastrointestinal syndromes, a figure that rose to 48% when stillbirths were excluded (menzies et al. 1996) . cryptosporidium, rotavirus, coronavirus, and escherichia coli are the major enteric pathogens in neonatal calves of 30 days or younger (mcdonough et al. 1994; bendali et al. 1999; de la fuente et al. 1999; naciri et al. 1999) .cattle are infected with at least four cryptosporidium species, including cryptosporidium parvum, cryptosporidium bovis, cryptosporidium andersoni, and the cryptosporidium deer-like genotype . a recent study in the united states has shown that the occurrence of these cryptosporidium spp. in cattle is age-related (santin et al. 2004) . c. parvum is responsible for about 85% of the cryptosporidium infections in preweaned calves but only 1% of the cryptosporidium infections in postweaned calves. postweaned calves and old cattle are mostly infected with c. bovis, c. andersoni, and the cryptosporidium deerlike genotype (santin et al. 2004) . nevertheless, c. parvum is the major species responsible for diarrhea in calves, and is the only zoonotic species in cattle.recently, researchers have used highly discriminatory subtyping techniques to study the transmission of bovine c. parvum infections in a geographic area (mallon et al. 2003a,b; . these tools are very useful in characterizing transmission dynamics of c. parvum in cattle, the maintenance of the parasite on cattle farms and the role of herd-toherd transmission in epidemiology. one of the most commonly used subtyping tools is based on sequence analysis of the 60-kda glycoprotein gene (gp60), which differentiates c. parvum to several subtype families and several subtypes within each family (strong et al. 2000; peng et al. 2001 peng et al. , 2003a sulaiman et al. 2001 sulaiman et al. , 2005 glaberman et al. 2002; leav et al. 2002; alves et al. 2003 alves et al. , 2006 sturbaum et al. 2003; wu et al. 2003; zhou et al. 2003; chalmers et al. 2005; abe et al. 2006; trotz-williams et al. 2006 ). of the two major c. parvum subtype families, the iia subtype family is zoonotic in nature and is seen in both humans and calves, whereas the iic subtype family is anthroponotic and is only found in humans (alves et al. 2003; .currently, little is known about the transmission of cryptosporidium spp. in cattle in northern ireland. a previous subtyping study of a small number of human specimens from outbreaks and sporadic cases identified several c. parvum iia subtypes, suggesting that these zoonotic subtypes might be present in cattle (glaberman et al. 2002) . we report in this study a molecular epidemiologic study of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal calves in northern ireland.fecal specimens submitted to the diagnostic laboratory at the veterinary sciences division of the department of agriculture and rural development for northern ireland, stormont, belfast, were used in the study. they were collected from symptomatic calves less than 1 month of age on farms across northern ireland over a 12-month period during march 2002 to february 2003. they were examined for the presence of cryptosporidium by a modified ziehl-neelsen staining technique (baxby et al. 1984) , rotavirus and coronavirus by enzymatic immunoassay using the pathasure enteritis elisa kit (vetoquinol uk ltd, bicester, england), and enteropathogenic e. coli k99+ by bacterial culture on a defined minimal medium minca agar (guinee et al. 1976 ) followed by the use of the latex agglutination test fimbrex k99 kit (the veterinary laboratories agency, addlestone, surrey, england).genomic dna was extracted from cryptosporidiumpositive specimens by alkaline digestion and phenolchloroform extraction, followed by dna purification using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit (qiagen, valencia, ca, usa), as previously described (peng et al. 2003b) . cryptosporidium spp. presented were genotyped by nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of an approximately 830-bp fragment of the small subunit (ssu) rrna gene ). all secondary pcr products were sequenced to further confirm the genotype identification.a fragment of the 60-kda glycoprotein (gp60) gene of approximately 850 bp was amplified by nested pcr as previously described, using 1 or 2 μl of the extracted dna in primary pcr (alves et al. 2003) . secondary pcr products were purified using the marligen rapid pcr purification kit (marligen biosystems, ijamsville, md, usa). sequencing reactions for the purified products were performed using the abi bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa), following the manufacturer's instructions. ssu rrna pcr products were sequenced in both directions using the forward and reverse primer used in secondary pcr, whereas gp60 products were mostly sequenced from the 5′ end. unincorporated fluorescent-dye terminators from the cycle-sequencing reaction were removed using autoseq g-50 columns (amersham biosciences, freiberg, germany). sequences were read on an abi3100 automated sequencer (applied biosystems). the nucleotide sequences obtained in this study were aligned with reference sequences retrieved from the genbank using the program clustalx (ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/clustalx/). the recently proposed nomenclature was used in naming c. parvum subtypes (sulaiman et al. 2005) .of the four common enteric pathogens in neonatal calves examined over 1 year period in this study, cryptosporidium was the most prevalent, being detected in 291 of 779 (37.4%) animals by microscopy of fecal smears stained by the modified ziehl-neelsen staining technique. rotavirus had a slightly lower prevalence rate, being found in 242 of 806 (30.0%) specimens tested. in contrast the prevalence rates of coronavirus (46/806 or 5.7% of animals) and e. coli k99+(16/421 or 3.8% of animals) were much lower (table 1) . a total of 224 specimens positive for cryptosporidium by microscopy were available for molecular analysis. among them, 62 specimens (27.6%) were concurrently positive for rotavirus, six (2.7%) for coronavirus, and three (1.3%) for e. coli k99+.cryptosporidium infection was detected in calves in every month over the 1 year period. there were considerable monthly variations in infection rates. however, infection rates during the summer months were generally lower than those in other months (fig. 1 ).the 224 specimens positive for cryptosporidium by microscopy and available for molecular analysis were collected from neonatal calves on 193 farms across northern ireland. dna extracted from them all yielded ssu rrna gene products of the expected size in nested pcr. rflp analysis with sspi and vspi produced similar sspi banding patterns and identical vspi banding pattern for all pcr products. the sspi rflp pattern of most pcr products was indicative of c. parvum, which were confirmed by results of dna sequencing. however, a few sspi rflp products yielded an upper band and a lower band that were slightly smaller than pcr products of c. parvum. dna sequencing indicated that they were c. bovis or cryptosporidium deer-like genotype. a few pcr products had a combination of the regular and the smaller upper bands. dna sequencing indicated that they were c. bovis (fig. 2) . altogether, c. parvum was identified in 213 specimens, c. bovis in eight specimens and cryptosporidium deer-like genotype in three specimens. the ssu rrna sequences of c. parvum, c. bovis and the deer-like genotype were identical to those from these species previously reported in the united states santin et al. 2004 ).of the 224 specimens analyzed by gp60 pcr, 216 produced products of the expected size, including all 213 specimens identified as c. parvum by ssu rrna pcr and three of the eight specimens identified as c. bovis. these products were sequenced successfully, except for five, which had sequence ambiguity at the 5′ end. alignment -7) , and some c. bovis (lanes 2, 3, 8, and 9) have a mixture of the larger and smaller upper bands of the sequences obtained with reference sequences revealed that 215 sequences belonged to the c. parvum subtype family iia, whereas the remaining sequence obtained from one c. parvum-infected calf had less than 90% homology to other sequences, thus belonged to a new c. parvum subtype family. altogether, 16 iia subtypes were found in neonatal calves studied (fig. 3) , which differed from each other only in the number of tca (designated by the letter a) and tcg (designated by the letter g) repeats. all iia subtype sequences had only one copy of the acatca sequence (designated by the letter r). the most common subtype was iiaa18g3r1, which was found in 120 calves. other less common subtypes included iiaa15g2r1, iiaa17g2r1, iiaa19g4r1, iiaa20g3r1, iiaa19g3r1, iiaa17g3r1, iiaa20g5r1, iiaa18g2r1, and iiaa20g2r1, which were seen in 28, 19, 15, 6, 5, 5, 3, 2, and 2 calves, respectively. the new subtype family and other iia subtypes (iiaa16g3r1, iiaa17g1r1, iiaa18r1, iiaa19g2r1, iiaa20g4r1, and iiaa21g2r1) were each found in only one animal. all five sequences with 5′ end ambiguity belonged to iia subtype family (fig. 3) .among the four more common iia subtypes, iia18g3r1 was found year around in all geographic areas in northern ireland (fig. 4) . subtype iiaa15g2r1, though much less common, was also found at low frequency in all areas, with the exception of a high occurrence in april 2002. subtype iiaa17g2r1 also mainly occurred in april 2002, but this was mostly due to the more extensive sampling of animals on a farm in the lough neagh basin area during an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis, in which all positive animals were infected with the subtype. subtype iiaa19g4r1 was found sporadically over the year (fig. 4) , predominantly in animals within a 15-mile radius in the north antrim area, suggesting the possibility of some common point of infection or transmission.previous studies in other countries have shown cryptosporidium, rotavirus, coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic e. coli are some common causes of diarrhea in neonatal calves less than 30 days old (reynolds et al. 1986; holland 1990; mcdonough et al. 1994; de la fuente et al. 1998; bendali et al. 1999; naciri et al. 1999) . results of this study suggest that the same is also true in northern ireland. the high prevalence of cryptosporidium and rotavirus in neonatal calves in the current study is in agreement with similar studies conducted in spain and france, which also showed lower prevalence of coronavirus and enterotoxigenic e. coli than the other two pathogens (de la fuente et al. 1998 (de la fuente et al. , 1999 naciri et al. 1999; garcia et al. 2000) . similar to what was observed before (moore and zeman 1991; garcia et al. 2000) , concurrent cryptosporidium and rotavirus infections were common in the present study. the higher occurrence of cryptosporidium infections in neonatal calves during winter and spring months is consistent with farming practice in northern ireland. because of the adverse climatic conditions prevailing in northern ireland during the winter months of october through to march, most stock is housed indoors during this period. this is accompanied by a concomitant increase in the numbers of susceptible calves being born while cows are housed indoors. this potentially provides ideal conditions for the transmission of cryptosporidium in newborn calves, either from direct contact with infected animals, or from contaminated bedding or housing, an infection source previously identified (atwill et al. 1998) . the lower detection rates during summer months were probably due to reductions in the numbers of symptomatic animals as a result of turnout of calves to pasture and a seasonal reduction in the numbers of calves being born. similar patterns of spring and winter peaks have previously been seen in the united states (xiao and herd 1994; mohammed et al. 1999 ). iiaa18g3r1  iiaa15g2r1  iiaa17g2r1  iiaa19g4r1  iiaa20g3r1  iiaa19g3r1  iiaa17g3r1  iia-unknown  iiaa20g5r1  iiaa18g2r1  iiaa20g2r1  iiaa16g3r1  iiaa17g1r1  iiaa18r1  iiaa19g2r1  iiaa20g4r1  iiaa21g2r1 new familyno. of specimens the genotype distribution of cryptosporidium seen in neonatal calves is very similar to that recently reported in the united states, with most infections due to c. parvum and c. bovis and the deer-like genotype only occasionally seen in neonatal calves younger than 30 days (santin et al. 2004) . the conservative nature of the ssu rrna gene sequences for the three species in different geographic areas indicates that the age-related infections with different cryptosporidium spp. previously observed in the united state probably also occurs in cattle in northern ireland.the existence of 17 c. parvum subtypes may be indicative of a high genetic diversity of c. parvum in northern ireland. previous studies in portugal, united states and canada have identified only a few c. parvum gp60 subtypes in calves in each area (alves et al. 2003 (alves et al. , 2006 peng et al. 2003b; trotz-williams et al. 2006 ). it is not clear whether the higher parasite diversity seen in this study was due to more extensive sampling of many farms. previously, a multilocus typing study also demonstrated the existence of many subtypes in calves in scotland (mallon et al. 2003b) . the existence of several subtypes in a small area in theory can be the result of infected animals being brought into the area, either from local, national or international sources, and introduction of these new subtypes to the native cattle population. however, the majority of calves on northern ireland farms are either home-bred or bought in from local sources such as livestock marts, so it is more likely the high genetic diversity of the parasite seen here represents geographic isolation due to reduced movement of animals between farms.over half of the animals examined in northern ireland were infected with the subtype iiaa18g3r1. this subtype was previously seen in two waterborne outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis in northern ireland in 2000 and 2001 (glaberman et al. 2002) . it was also seen in two sporadic human cases in australia and one calf in canada (chalmers et al. 2005; trotz-williams et al. 2006) . the widespread distribution both geographically and temporally indicates the successful transmission capabilities of this subtype either by direct animal-to-animal contact or through environmental contamination. it is interesting to note that another more widely distributed c. parvum subtype, iiaa15g2r1, was only seen in 13% of infected calves. the latter was responsible for 85% of c. parvum infections in calves and other ruminants in portugal (alves et al. 2006) , and has been found in humans and calves in the united states, canada, united kingdom, portugal, slovenia, australia, japan, and kuwait (glaberman et al. 2002; peng et al. 2003b; stantic-pavlinic et al. 2003; wu et al. 2003; chalmers et al. 2005; sulaiman et al. 2005; abe et al. 2006; alves et al. 2006; trotz-williams et al. 2006) .in addition to iiaa18g3r1 and iiaa15g2r1, six other subtypes found in calves in the present study, including iiaa17g2r1, iiaa20g3r1, iiaa19g3r1, iiaa17g3r1, iiaa19g2r1, and iiaa20g4r1, were previously reported in humans in northern ireland (glaberman et al. 2002) . another subtype in calves, iiaa17g1r1, has been found in three outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in neighboring england and wales that were associated with direct contact with animals or consumption of contaminated water (chalmers et al. 2005) . the similar distribution of c. parvum subtypes between humans and calves in the same geographic area suggests a role for calves in the transmission of human cryptosporidiosis in this area, even though more studies are clearly needed to assess the extent of calf-to-human transmission. as expected, the anthroponotic c. parvum iic subtype family, which is the most common type of c. parvum in humans in most countries (alves et al. 2003; xiao et al. 2003; , was not seen in calves in the current and in previous studies.in conclusion, results of the study have shown the occurrence of c. bovis and the cryptosporidium deer-like genotype in the calves in northern ireland and the uniqueness of c. parvum transmission on farms in northern ireland, with one predominant subtype in neonatal calves. the widespread occurrence of the subtype in calves and humans demonstrates the genetic fitness of the parasite in the transmission of cryptosporidiosis. it also raises some concerns about the selection of highly infectious subtypes by intensive animal husbandry. future multilocus subtyping studies would increase our understanding of the transmission dynamics of c. parvum in cattle and humans.objectives coronaviruses cause upper respiratory illness and occasionally lower tract disease in susceptible populations. in this study we examined the prevalence of 4 human coronaviruses, including subtypes oc43, 229e, and the recently described nl63 and hku1 in a pediatric population presenting to a children's hospital. patients and methods specimens collected over a 1-year period from pediatric patients presenting with acute respiratory illness were analyzed for the presence of 4 coronavirus subtypes using consensus and subtype-specific real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with coronavirus infection were examined retrospectively. results coronaviruses were detected in 66 of 1043 children. eight, 11, 19, and 28 specimens were positive for subtypes 229e, nl63, oc43, and hku1, respectively. coronaviruses were detected throughout the study period; all 4 of the subtypes were present simultaneously in december. the acute clinical features were similar across subtypes. of 32 children infected with a coronavirus as the sole respiratory pathogen, 13 had lower respiratory tract disease. children whose only detectable respiratory virus was a coronavirus were more likely to have underlying chronic disease than were children coinfected with another respiratory virus. conclusions although 4 subtypes of coronavirus were detected, the recently discovered coronavirus subtypes nl63 and hku1 accounted for the majority of coronaviruses detected in our cohort of mostly hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms. new subtypes likely represent a substantial portion of previously unexplained respiratory illnesses.clinical disease in children associated with newly described coronavirus subtypes.however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of sads-cov from 68 bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored. recently it was shown 69 that sads-cov is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse, 70 chicken, pig, monkey and human, indicating a high potential of the sads-cov for 71 interspecies transmission 17 . 72 the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host 73 receptor with the s1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the s2 74 subunit, thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism 18, 19 . as a class i viral 75 fusion protein, the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each 76 monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into s1 and 77 s2 subunits 18 . for most coronaviruses, the n-terminal domain (ntd) of the s1 subunit hcov-oc43 utilizes ntd to recognize glycans 29 ; and one exception is mhv, which 83 utilizes the ntd to bind mouse receptor ceacam1a 30 . therefore, the s1 subunit, 84 especially its ntd and ctd, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible 85 for different tropisms of coronaviruses. in comparison, the s2 subunit containing the 86 fusion peptide (fp) and heptad repeats (hr1 and hr2) for membrane fusion are more 87 conserved in both sequence and structure 18, 19 . for the sads-cov, receptor analysis 88 indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ace2, dpp4 89 and apn are essential for the cell entry 7,17 . there are also no reports regarding to the the spikes of sads-cov (1130 amino acid residues) and hku2 (1128 amino 102 acid residues) are the shortest among all known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and 103 their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28%, 104 indicating the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov are unique 5-10,47 . in this study, we report 105 the cryo-em structures of the sads-cov and hku2 spike trimers at 2.83 å and 2.38 106 å resolution, respectively. the hku2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat 107 coronavirus. we analyzed the hku2 and sads-cov trimer structures and also 108 compared the ntd, ctd, sd1 and sd2 domains of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit protein expression and structure determination 116 the cdnas encoding hku2 spike (yp_001552236) and sads-cov spike 117 (avm41569.1) were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression.hku2 ectodomains (residues 1-1066) and sads-cov ectodomains (residues 1-1068) 119 were separately cloned into pfastbac-dual vector (invitrogen) with c-terminal foldon 120 tag and strep tag. after expression in hi5 insect cells and purification to homogeneity, 121 the cryo-em images on these two spike ectodomains were recorded using fei titan 122 krios microscope operating at 300 kv with a gatan k2 summit direct electron detector 123 ( supplementary fig. 1 ). about 1,400,000 particles for hku2 spike and 900,000 124 particles for sads-cov spike were subjected to 2d classification, and a total of 125 421,490 particles of hku2 spike and 152,334 particles of sads-cov spike were selected and subjected to 3d refinement with c3 symmetry to generate density maps 127 ( supplementary fig. 2 ). the overall density maps were solved to 2.38 å for hku2 128 spike and 2.83 å for sads-cov spike (gold-standard fourier shell correlation = 0.143) 129 (supplementary fig. 1 and supplementary fig. 2) . the atomic-resolution density map 130 enabled us to build nearly all residues of hku2 spike ectodomains (residues 17-995) 131 except for a few breaks (residues 129-141 and 204-204), as well as 48 n-linked glycans 132 (supplementary fig. 3a and supplementary fig. 4a) . the final refined model of sads-cov spike contains residues 19-998 with some short breaks (residues 134-143 and 488-134 490) and 45 n-linked glycans (supplementary fig. 3b and supplementary fig. 4b ).135 data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed in overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes 139 the overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes we determined here resemble 140 the previously reported pre-fusion structures of coronaviruses spikes. both spike 141 trimers have a mushroom-like shape (~150 å in height and ~115 å in width) (fig. 1a) , 142 consisting of a cap mainly formed by β-sheets of the s1 subunit, a central stalk mainly 143 formed by α-helices of the s2 subunit, and a root formed by twisted β-sheets and loops 144 of the s2 subunit (fig. 1a) . in each trimer there is a c3 axis along the central stalk ( fig.   145 1a). the amino acid identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 86%, and these cα atoms of the trimer. due to the high structural similarity, we will use the hku2 149 structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description, whereas 150 significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary.the s1 subunit of the hku2 spike comprises two major domains, ntd and ctd, 152 which are followed by two subdomains sd1 and sd2 connecting them to the s2 subunit 153 ( fig. 1b and fig. 1c) . the s1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike, 154 in which the three ctds in the inner part are at the apex sitting on top of the central 155 stalk and the three ntds are located outside the ctds surrounding the central stalk ( fig. 1a) . the ntd, ctd, sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit are all mainly composed of 157 β strands regarding to the secondary structure feature (fig. 1c) . in contrast, the upstream 158 helix (uh), fusion peptide (fp), connecting region (cr), heptad repeat 1 (hr1) and 159 central helix (ch) of the s2 subunit are mainly composed of helices, whereas the β-160 hairpin (bh) and subdomain 3 (sd3) at the bottom part of the s2 subunit mainly consist 161 of β stands and loops (fig. 1c) . moreover, the residues after the sd3, which contain the the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit are highly similar in amino (fig. 2b) . besides, c 234 -c 244 (numbered in hku2 and connecting the bottom helix 216 to the bottom sheet) is conserved in both subtype i and subtype ii ntds (fig. 2b) . 217 the ntds of β-coronaviruses including bcov, hcov-hku1, hcov-oc43, 218 mers-cov, sars-cov and mhv resemble the subtype i, rather than the subtype ii 219 ntd in the topology and distribution of the disulfide bonds (fig. 2c) . these β-220 coronavirus ntds have additional loops in the n-terminus, between β1 and β2 strands, 221 and between β6 and β7 stands (numbered in hku2 structure), forming an extensive 222 ceiling-like structure on top of the galectin-like fold (fig. 2c) . it has been found that the the ctd of hku2 has a twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet as the core with 234 connecting loops between the stands (fig. 3a) . it contains four disulfide bonds: c 277 -235 c 300 and c 285 -c 290 at the n-terminus, c 341 -c 397 at the c-terminus and the last one c 331 -236 c 369 connecting the β2 and β5 strands in the core β sheet (fig. 3a) . interestingly, the 237 ctd core of hku2 is of high structural similarity with the conserved ctd core of β-238 coronaviruses and the disulfide bonds in the ctd of hku2 except for c 285 -c 290 are 239 also detected in all β-coronavirus ctds (fig. 3b) . these ctds have the core of one 240 twisted β-sheet and here we name them as one-layer ctd subtype ( fig. 3a and fig. 3b ).the β-coronavirus ctds always have an insertion consisting of loops and/or stands 242 between the β5 and β6 strands of the core (fig. 3b) . sars-cov, mers-cov, hku4 243 and hku5 have receptor-binding motif (rbm) in this insertion region responsible for 244 binding their respective protein receptors 45 . in the ctd of hku2, there is only one 245 short loop between the β5 and β6 strands of the core twisted β-sheet (fig. 3a) . 246 although as members in the α-genus, hku2 and sads-cov ctd structures are 247 significantly different from those of other α-coronaviruses hcov-nl63, hcov-229e, 248 pedv, tgev and prcv that contain two layers of β-sheets (fig. 3c) . and we named 249 these ctds as two-layer ctd subtype. all available two-layer ctd structures can be and sads-cov. these two-layer ctds contain two highly conserved disulfide bonds:c 540 -c 586 and c 569 -c 596 (numbered in pedv ctd) (fig. 3c ). the c 569 -c 596 is conserved 253 among all coronaviruses, whereas the c 540 -c 586 is conserved in all α-coronaviruses 254 (except for hku2 and sads) and δ-coronavirus pdcov (fig. 3c) .the ctd of δ-coronavirus pdcov have a core of two β-sheets, belonging to the 256 two-layer ctd subtype (fig. 3c) . as for the γ-coronavirus ibv, the core of its ctd is 257 also similar to the typical two-layer ctd (fig. 3c) . however, several β strands are the sd1 and sd2 are two subdomains following the ctd in the s1 subunit, linking 264 the ctd to the s2 subunit. the hku2 sd1 is a partial β barrel consisting of five β 265 strands and a disulfide bond (c 409 -c 458 ) connecting its c-terminus to the β1 strand (fig.   266 4a). this five-stranded β barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all 267 four genera of coronavirus (fig. 4a) . the hku2 sd2 has a structure of two layers of 268 β-sheet with an additional short α-helix over the top sheet (fig. 4b) . the additional α-269 helix and the top sheet is linked by a disulfide bond (c 482 -c 509 ), and another disulfide 270 bond (c 524 -c 533 ) links the c-terminal loop to the bottom sheet (fig. 4b) . the two-layer 271 core structure and the second disulfide bond are conserved among all genera of 272 coronavirus, however, the additional α helix and the first linking disulfide bond is a 273 distinct feature of β-coronaviruses plus α-coronavirus hku2 and sads-cov (fig. 4b) . 274 this additional helix appears to be an insertion between the primitive β2 and β3 strands 275 of the sd2, and is retained during evolution of β-coronaviruses.quaternary packing of the ntd and ctd in the spike 278 it has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of 279 the s1 subunits in the trimer: intra-subunit packing and cross-subunit packing 41 .actually, this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between ntd 281 and ctd in the spike monomer. the hku2 s1 subunit, similar to those in -282 coronaviruses hcov-nl63, hcov-226e and pedv and -coronavirus pdcov, have 283 an "inward" ctd which contacts with the ntd (fig. 5a) . the three structural "ntd-284 ctd" modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of ntd and ctd from 285 the same monomer, forming the intra-subunit packing in the spike trimer (fig. 5a) . the 286 s1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the and -genera including mhv, sars-cov, 287 mers-cov, hcov-oc43 and ibv have an "outward" ctd that is far away from the 288 ntd (fig. 5b) . therefore, the three structural "ntd-ctd" modules in the cap region 289 of these spikes have the ntd from one monomer and the ctd from the adjacent 290 monomer, forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer (fig. 5b) . interestingly, 291 we found that the "outward" ctds always have an insertion in the core structure, such 292 as β-coronavirus ctds and -coronavirus ibv ctd (fig. 5b) . in contrast, all "inward" 293 ctds only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted 294 region. 297 sequence analysis suggested that the s1/s2 protease cleavage site at the boundary 298 between the s1 and s2 subunits is r544-m545 in hku2 spike and r546-m547 in 299 sads-cov spike 5,8,47 . compared to the s1 subunit, the topology and structure of s2 (residues 888-929) and a β-sandwich like sd3 (residues 930-995) ( fig. 1b and fig. 6a) . 305 like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state, the model of hr2 after sd3 was 306 not built in the structure due to poor density. five disulfide bonds in s2 are detected.two of them (c 590 -c 612 and c 595 -c 601 ) stabilize the folded helices of uh, c 696 -c 706 308 bends the cr, c 884 -c 895 links the ch and the bh, and c 934 -c 943 is within the sd3 (fig.   309 6a). the first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses, and the last one fig. 4) . the typical cr 321 in the s2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand, with a disulfide bond 322 bending the first and second helix to form a turning (fig. 6b) . in hku2, the second 323 helix is replaced by a short strand (713-716) and the third helix is replaced by a loop 324 (721-741), therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in hku2 cr (fig.   325 6c). the conserved disulfide bond c 696 -c 706 makes the first helix of cr in hku2 spike 326 turn upside down. the s2' cleavage site (between r671 and s672) is then covered by 327 the reversed cr helix and loops, and r671 interacts with e723 in the loop and k697 328 and k698 in helix 1 (fig. 6c) . in other coronaviruses, taking the mhv s2 for example, 329 the helix 1 does not cover the s2' site (between r869 and s870), and r869 only loosely 330 interacts with t929 in helix 3 (fig. 6b) . after the dissociation of the s1 subunit triggered the hku2 and sads-cov have one ntd in the s1 subunit, and their structures 358 are more similar to the ntd1 than the ntd2 of -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and 359 pedv, whereas the only ntd of hcov-229e is structurally more similar to the ntd2 360 than the ntd1 (fig. 2) . therefore, we suggest that α-coronaviruses have two subtypes 361 of ntd. the evolution relationship between them are not clear yet. it was once 362 suggested that the presence of two ntds in hcov-nl63 is a result of gene 363 duplication 31 . however, the sequence identity between these two ntds is only 15.7% 364 in hcov-nl63 and 12.9% in pedv. considering that hku2 (sads-cov) and 365 hcov-229e have one ntd belonging to either subtype i or subtype ii, a more plausible 366 evolution way of the ntd in α-coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate 367 primitive domains into the genome, resulting in the presence of two ntds in the s1 368 subunit α-coronaviruses including hcov-nl63 and pedv. to be note, these two ntd (fig. 2d) . in contrast, the δ-coronavirus pdcov ntd is similar to the 377 hcov-229e ntd representing the subtype ii in both architecture and disulfide bond 378 positions (fig. 2e) . a previous study of the ibv spike proposed that α-coronavirus 379 ntds are probably the most ancestral and the ntds of the four genera form an 380 evolutionary spectrum in the order of α-, δ-, γ-, and β-genus 41 . our proposal here is 381 similar to the previous one in the point that two ntd subtypes in -coronaviruses may 382 represent primitive structures that could be the evolutionary ancestors of ntds.however, we argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of α-, δ-, γ-, 384 and β-genus. a more plausible pathway is that the β-, γ-and δ-coronavirus ntds may 385 evolve independently and parallelly from subtype i (β-and γ-coronavirus ntds) or 386 subtype ii (δ-coronavirus ntds) (supplementary fig. 7b ).the hku2 and sads-cov ctd structure have a one-layer core consisting of a (a) α-coronavirus s1 and δ-coronavirus s1 use intra-subunit packing pattern. ntd and ctd from the first monomer are colored blue, the second are colored red, and the third are colored green. pdb codes: hcov-229e, 6u7h; pdcov, 6b7n. (b) β-coronavirus s1 and γ-coronavirus s1 use cross-subunit packing pattern. ntd and ctd from the first monomer are colored blue, the second are colored red, and the third are colored green. the extra loop of ibv and the extra domains of βcovs are colored yellow and labeled as ex. pdb codes: mhv, 3jcl; ibv, 6cv0; sars, 5xlr. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of sads-cov from 68 bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored. recently it was shown 69 that sads-cov is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse, 70 chicken, pig, monkey and human, indicating a high potential of the sads-cov for 71 interspecies transmission 17 . 72 the spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host 73 receptor with the s1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the s2 74 subunit, thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism 18, 19 . as a class i viral 75 fusion protein, the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each 76 monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into s1 and 77 s2 subunits 18 . for most coronaviruses, the n-terminal domain (ntd) of the s1 subunit hcov-oc43 utilizes ntd to recognize glycans 29 ; and one exception is mhv, which 83 utilizes the ntd to bind mouse receptor ceacam1a 30 . therefore, the s1 subunit, 84 especially its ntd and ctd, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible 85 for different tropisms of coronaviruses. in comparison, the s2 subunit containing the 86 fusion peptide (fp) and heptad repeats (hr1 and hr2) for membrane fusion are more 87 conserved in both sequence and structure 18, 19 . for the sads-cov, receptor analysis 88 indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ace2, dpp4 89 and apn are essential for the cell entry 7,17 . there are also no reports regarding to the the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not

δ-coronavirus spike structure is determined for pdcov 42,43 . the cryo-99 em structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported, and only crystal 100 structures of the ctd from hku4 44 , hku5 45 and hku9 46 were determined. 101 the spikes of sads-cov (1130 amino acid residues) and hku2 (1128 amino 102 acid residues) are the shortest among all known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and 103 their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28%, 104 indicating the spikes of hku2 and sads-cov are unique [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 47 . in this study, we report 105 the cryo-em structures of the sads-cov and hku2 spike trimers at 2.83 å and 2.38 106 å resolution, respectively. the hku2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat 107 coronavirus. we analyzed the hku2 and sads-cov trimer structures and also 108 compared the ntd, ctd, sd1 and sd2 domains of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit protein expression and structure determination 116 the cdnas encoding hku2 spike (yp_001552236) and sads-cov spike 117 (avm41569.1) were synthesized with codons optimized for insect cell expression.hku2 ectodomains (residues 1-1066) and sads-cov ectodomains (residues 1-1068) 119 were separately cloned into pfastbac-dual vector (invitrogen) with c-terminal foldon 120 tag and strep tag. after expression in hi5 insect cells and purification to homogeneity, 121 the cryo-em images on these two spike ectodomains were recorded using fei titan 122 krios microscope operating at 300 kv with a gatan k2 summit direct electron detector 123 ( supplementary fig. 1 ). about 1,400,000 particles for hku2 spike and 900,000 124 particles for sads-cov spike were subjected to 2d classification, and a total of 125 421,490 particles of hku2 spike and 152,334 particles of sads-cov spike were 126 author/funder. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the .

were solved to 2.38 å for hku2 128 spike and 2.83 å for sads-cov spike (gold-standard fourier shell correlation = 0.143) 129 (supplementary fig. 1 and supplementary fig. 2) . the atomic-resolution density map 130 enabled us to build nearly all residues of hku2 spike ectodomains (residues 17-995) 131 except for a few breaks (residues 129-141 and 204-204), as well as 48 n-linked glycans 132 (supplementary fig. 3a and supplementary fig. 4a) . the final refined model of sads-cov spike contains residues 19-998 with some short breaks (residues 134-143 and 488-134 490) and 45 n-linked glycans (supplementary fig. 3b and supplementary fig. 4b ).135 data collection and refinement statistics for these two structures are listed in overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes 139 the overall structures of hku2 and sads-cov spikes we determined here resemble 140 the previously reported pre-fusion structures of coronaviruses spikes. both spike 141 trimers have a mushroom-like shape (~150 å in height and ~115 å in width) (fig. 1a) , 142 consisting of a cap mainly formed by β-sheets of the s1 subunit, a central stalk mainly 143 formed by α-helices of the s2 subunit, and a root formed by twisted β-sheets and loops 144 of the s2 subunit (fig. 1a) . in each trimer there is a c3 axis along the central stalk ( fig.   145 1a). the amino acid identity between hku2 and sads-cov spikes is 86%, and these 146 two spike structures are quite similar with the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) 147 being 0.53 å for 962 aligned cα atoms of the monomer and 0.56 å for 2886 aligned 148 cα atoms of the trimer. due to the high structural similarity, we will use the hku2 149 structure to present the features of both spikes in the subsequent description, whereas 150 significant differences between them will be pointed out only when necessary.the s1 subunit of the hku2 spike comprises two major domains, ntd and ctd, 152 which are followed by two subdomains sd1 and sd2 connecting them to the s2 subunit 153 ( fig. 1b and fig. 1c) . the s1 subunits from three monomers form the cap of the spike, the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the .

feature (fig. 1c) . in contrast, the upstream 158 helix (uh), fusion peptide (fp), connecting region (cr), heptad repeat 1 (hr1) and 159 central helix (ch) of the s2 subunit are mainly composed of helices, whereas the β-160 hairpin (bh) and subdomain 3 (sd3) at the bottom part of the s2 subunit mainly consist 161 of β stands and loops (fig. 1c) . moreover, the residues after the sd3, which contain the the sd1 and sd2 of the s1 subunit and the s2 subunit are highly similar in amino the ntd of hku2 has three layers of antiparallel β-sheet with the top one consisting 182 of six strands, the middle one consisting of five strands and the bottom one consisting 183 of three strands. below the bottom sheet is a short α-helix (fig. 2a) . the top and middle 184 β-sheets form a galectin-like β-sandwich fold, which is inserted between two stands of 185 the bottom sheet (fig. 2a) . to supplement, three disulfide bonds are detected in the 186 author/funder. all rights reserved. no reuse

hku2, there is only one 245 short loop between the β5 and β6 strands of the core twisted β-sheet (fig. 3a) . 246 although as members in the α-genus, hku2 and sads-cov ctd structures are 247 significantly different from those of other α-coronaviruses hcov-nl63, hcov-229e, 248 pedv, tgev and prcv that contain two layers of β-sheets (fig. 3c) . and we named 249 these ctds as two-layer ctd subtype. all available two-layer ctd structures can be 250 well aligned with cα r.m.s.d. in the range of 1.0-3.4 å, except for the ctds of hku2 251 and sads-cov. these two-layer ctds contain two highly conserved disulfide bonds: 252 c 540 -c 586 and c 569 -c 596 (numbered in pedv ctd) (fig. 3c ). the c 569 -c 596 is conserved 253 among all coronaviruses, whereas the c 540 -c 586 is conserved in all α-coronaviruses 254 (except for hku2 and sads) and δ-coronavirus pdcov (fig. 3c) .the ctd of δ-coronavirus pdcov have a core of two β-sheets, belonging to the 256 two-layer ctd subtype (fig. 3c) . as for the γ-coronavirus ibv, the core of its ctd is 257 also similar to the typical two-layer ctd (fig. 3c) . however, several β strands are the sd1 and sd2 are two subdomains following the ctd in the s1 subunit, linking 264 the ctd to the s2 subunit. the hku2 sd1 is a partial β barrel consisting of five β 265 strands and a disulfide bond (c 409 -c 458 ) connecting its c-terminus to the β1 strand ( fig.   266 4a). this five-stranded β barrel and the linking disulfide bond are conserved among all 267 four genera of coronavirus (fig. 4a) . the hku2 sd2 has a structure of two layers of 268

appears to be an insertion between the primitive β2 and β3 strands 275 of the sd2, and is retained during evolution of β-coronaviruses.quaternary packing of the ntd and ctd in the spike 278 it has been observed that coronaviruses have two types of quaternary packing mode of 279 the s1 subunits in the trimer: intra-subunit packing and cross-subunit packing 41 .actually, this is mainly caused by different positioning and interaction between ntd 281 and ctd in the spike monomer. the hku2 s1 subunit, similar to those in -282 coronaviruses hcov-nl63, hcov-226e and pedv and -coronavirus pdcov, have 283 an "inward" ctd which contacts with the ntd (fig. 5a) . the three structural "ntd-284 ctd" modules in the cap region of these spikes are composed of ntd and ctd from 285 the same monomer, forming the intra-subunit packing in the spike trimer (fig. 5a) . the 286 s1 subunits of other coronaviruses in the and -genera including mhv, sars-cov, 287 mers-cov, hcov-oc43 and ibv have an "outward" ctd that is far away from the 288 ntd (fig. 5b) . therefore, the three structural "ntd-ctd" modules in the cap region 289 of these spikes have the ntd from one monomer and the ctd from the adjacent 290 monomer, forming the cross-subunit packing in the spike trimer (fig. 5b) . interestingly, 291 we found that the "outward" ctds always have an insertion in the core structure, such 292 as β-coronavirus ctds and -coronavirus ibv ctd (fig. 5b) . in contrast, all "inward"ctds only have the one-layer or two-layer core structure without obvious inserted 294 region.conserved s2 subunit and a distinct cr 297 sequence analysis suggested that the s1/s2 protease cleavage site at the boundary 298 between the s1 and s2 subunits is r544-m545 in hku2 spike and r546-m547 in 299 sads-cov spike

biorxiv preprint (residues 748-836), a central helix (ch) (residues 837-887), a twisted β-hairpin (bh) 304 (residues 888-929) and a β-sandwich like sd3 (residues 930-995) (fig. 1b and fig. 6a) . 305 like in other coronavirus spikes in the prefusion state, the model of hr2 after sd3 was 306 not built in the structure due to poor density. five disulfide bonds in s2 are detected.two of them (c 590 -c 612 and c 595 -c 601 ) stabilize the folded helices of uh, c 696 -c 706 308 bends the cr, c 884 -c 895 links the ch and the bh, and c 934 -c 943 is within the sd3 (fig.   309   6a ). the first four disulfide bonds are conserved in all coronaviruses, and the last one fig. 4) . the typical cr 321 in the s2 subunit contains three helices and one short strand, with a disulfide bond 322 bending the first and second helix to form a turning (fig. 6b) . in hku2, the second 323 helix is replaced by a short strand (713-716) and the third helix is replaced by a loop 324 (721-741), therefore there are two short strands and only one helix in hku2 cr (fig.   325 6c). the conserved disulfide bond c 696 -c 706 makes the first helix of cr in hku2 spike 326 turn upside down. the s2' cleavage site (between r671 and s672) is then covered by 327 the reversed cr helix and loops, and r671 interacts with e723 in the loop and k697 328 and k698 in helix 1 (fig. 6c) . in other coronaviruses, taking the mhv s2 for example, 329 the helix 1 does not cover the s2' site (between r869 and s870), and r869 only loosely 330 interacts with t929 in helix 3 (fig. 6b) . after the dissociation of the s1 subunit triggered 331 by receptor binding, the exposure of the s2' site for cleavage is a prerequisite for the 332 proteolytic activation of the coronavirus spike to mediate membrane fusion. the buried 333

biorxiv preprint s2' site indicates that hku2 spike, compared to other coronavirus spikes, would 334 require more conformational changes around the s2' site for the exposure. the hku2 and sads-cov have one ntd in the s1 subunit, and their structures 358 are more similar to the ntd1 than the ntd2 of -coronaviruses hcov-nl63 and 359 pedv, whereas the only ntd of hcov-229e is structurally more similar to the ntd2 360 than the ntd1 (fig. 2) . therefore, we suggest that α-coronaviruses have two subtypes 361 of ntd. the evolution relationship between them are not clear yet. it was once 362

biorxiv preprint suggested that the presence of two ntds in hcov-nl63 is a result of gene 363 duplication 31 . however, the sequence identity between these two ntds is only 15.7% 364 in hcov-nl63 and 12.9% in pedv. considering that hku2 (sads-cov) and 365 hcov-229e have one ntd belonging to either subtype i or subtype ii, a more plausible 366 evolution way of the ntd in α-coronaviruses is the recombination of two separate 367 primitive domains into the genome, resulting in the presence of two ntds in the s1 368 subunit α-coronaviruses including hcov-nl63 and pedv. to be note, these two ntd however, we argue that the evolution pathways may not be in the order of α-, δ-, γ-, 384 and β-genus. a more plausible pathway is that the β-, γ-and δ-coronavirus ntds may 385 evolve independently and parallelly from subtype i (β-and γ-coronavirus ntds) or 386 subtype ii (δ-coronavirus ntds) (supplementary fig. 7b ).the hku2 and sads-cov ctd structure have a one-layer core consisting of a 388 twisted five-stranded antiparallel β sheet. interestingly, -coronavirus ctds also have 389 the similar one-layer core structure and three strictly conserved disulfide bonds are also 390 present in the core of hku2 ctd. currently, all identified receptor-binding motif of -391 coronavirus ctds are within an inserted domain between two stands of the core sheet, 392 author/funder. all rights

ctd family, while the inserted domain in -coronaviruses 395 results from a recombinant event during evolution (supplementary fig. 7c) . the second 396 indication is that hku2 and sads-cov may not utilize the ctd to bind protein 397 receptors that have not been identified yet, and their different receptor usage may be 398 determined by the ntd that harbors almost 50% of residue difference between them.to be note, the ctds from other -coronaviruses, γ-coronavirus ibv and δ-coronavirus . three monomers of hku2 spike are colored magenta, green, and orange, respectively; three monomers of

has been declared as a pandemic by the world health organization (who) after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-cov-2 (sars-cov-2) (ng et al., 2020) . the primary host for the sars-cov-2 has been identified as bats and the terminal host as humans (khan et al., 2020) . the related research revealed that sars-cov und sars-cov-2 share approximately 76% of amino acid identity . the primary symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, myalgia, headache, hyposmia and with common complications like acute respiratory distress (29%), acute cardiac injury (12%), and acute renal injury (7%) (huang et al., 2020) .it has been well established that covs require the ace2 or dpp4 receptors for entry into the host cells (seys et al., 2018; walls et al., 2020; wrapp et al., 2020) . the organs or the cells expressing ace2 are more vulnerable to the cov infection (glowacka et al., 2011) .according to hoffmann et al. , the viral entry in the host cell depends on the sars-cov receptor ace2 for binding and requires the tmprss2 for priming and also relies on tmprss2 activity (hoffmann et al., 2020) . therefore, it is speculated that other auxiliary proteins or co-receptors might facilitate the entry of covs in the host cells. these coreceptors or auxiliary proteins include tmprss2, anpep, enpep (qi et al., 2020) .therefore, it has been proposed that organs representing the co-expression of co-receptors or auxiliary proteins such as tmprss2, anpep, or enpep for ace2 and dpp4 are more susceptible for the viral entry replication and severity of the disease. the thought of extrapulmonary spread is not evitable due to the presence of these receptors and co-receptors.the prominent population with increased risk of virus infection are older patients and those associated with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, copd, and cancers (sun et al., 2020) . viral infection with comorbidities is responsible for higher mortality. according to lee and colleagues, cancer patients are twice more likely to contract the infection than the normal population (lee et al., 2020) . patients who received chemotherapy or surgery within the 30 days before the covid-19 pandemic have more risk of infection than the patients who had not undergone chemotherapy or surgery (sharma et al., 2020) . according to an analysis of italian patients published in march, 20% of those who died from covid-19 in the country had active cancer . notably, the guidelines for cancer patients during the covid-19 pandemic focus on lung cancer patients undergoing active chemotherapy or radical radiotherapy, and on patients with blood cancers (burki, 2020) . the association of these receptors with the pathogenicity of the solid tumors is still to be solved.in the present study, we investigated molecular profiling data of the various proteins required for the entry of the covs in normal tissues and cancer tissues. immunological aspects of the study of pathogenesis cannot be overlooked. therefore, we also explored an immune perspective concerning cancer. understanding the usage of the multiplicity of receptors and co-receptors by the various covs can open new avenues for understanding the pathogenesis and development of intervention strategies.sars-cov-2 requires ace2 as its receptor for host cell entry which is involved in various biological functions primarily in the renin-angiotensin system ( figure 1a ). dpp4, anpep, enpep, and tmprss2 have also been proposed as co-receptors to initiate sar-cov-2 infection (qi et al., 2020) . string pathway analysis revealed a high confident interaction between these proteins, which have peptidase activity and are involved in angiotensin system, peptide metabolism, and viral entry into the host cell ( figure 1b and table 1 ). hence, we extracted the rna and protein expression data of all these receptors in healthy tissues and solid tumors. we found enrichment of ace2 at rna levels in testis, small intestine, and kidney ( figure 1c ). along with ace2, enrichment of rnas for the other four co-receptors occurred in normal lung, mammary, liver, prostate, thyroid, head and neck tissues, small intestine, and kidney tissues ( figure 1c ). the protein expression levels of ace2 and coreceptors showed a similar expression pattern as to their rna ( figure 1e ). renal tumors exhibited the highest expression of ace2 receptor among solid tumor tissues followed by gastrointestinal cancers such as colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancer ( figure 1d ). dpp4, anpep, and enpep rna expression were also elevated in renal tumors compared to other cancer tissues. of note, tmprss2 rna expression was highest in prostate cancer tissues, whereas renal tumors featured among the lowest expressing tissues. tcga data analysis also showed increased expression of all receptors except tmprss2 in renal tumor tissues as compared to their adjacent normal (sup fig 1) . we found that protein level data was also in concordance to rna expression data in solid tumors. renal cancer expressed higher percent positivity of all receptors except tmprss2, which exhibited the highest percent positivity in prostate tumor tissues ( figure 1f ,g).we observed that ace2, anpep, enpep, and dpp4 gene expression was higher in renal papillary carcinoma (kirp) and renal clear cell carcinoma (kirc), whereas tmprss2 showed increased expression in renal chromophobe (kich) (figure 2a and sup fig 2a) . we further analyzed the correlation of ace2 with all four receptors in each renal cancer types.we observed a statistically significant correlation of ace2 with dpp4 in kich (p<0.01, ρ = 0.365), kirc (p<0.001, ρ = 0.494), kirp (p<0.001, ρ = 0.393) and also with anpep in kirp (p<0.001, ρ = 0.277) ( figure 2b ). and also negatively correlated with tumor stages in kirp tumor tissues along with anpep (ρ = -0.153, p<0.05). enpep only showed a significant (ρ = -0.112, p<0.01) negative correlation with tumor stages in kirc tumors ( figure 2c ). as molecular subtypes of kirp are well defined, we also analyzed the expression pattern of these receptors in various molecular subtypes. we observed that all cov receptors showed significantly (p<0.001, kruskal-wallis test) increased expression in c1, c2a, and c2b subtypes compared to c2c-cimp subtype of kirp (subtype with high dna methylation) ( figure 2d ). had a higher expression of tmprss2 ( figure 3a and supl fig 2b) . we also analyzed the correlation between the cov receptor genes and immune cell signatures, for each of the 32 cancer types in tcga. the cov receptors tended to show a high correlation with immune signatures in most cancer types, though ace2 and tmprss2 exhibited weaker correlations than other receptors (supl fig 2c) . further, we specifically analyzed ace2, which is a primary sars-cov receptor and dpp4, highly correlated to ace2 across the kidney cancer subtypes along with immune cell signatures (innate and adaptive immunity, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines). we observed that ace2 and dpp4 exhibited increased expression in all molecular subtypes except kich, cimp subtype of kirp, and cc-e.3kirc subtype ( figure 3b ). we found that these receptors are highly correlated to the innate and adaptive immunity-related cells, as well as il-10, il-6, cxcl10, ccl2-ccl5, tgfb1in kirc tumors, whereas in kiprp tumor tissues il8, il1a and tnf were highly correlated ( figure 3b ). our results revealed that, in kirc tumors, the expressions of various markers of exhausted t cells (cd137, pd1, ctla4) and immunosuppressive microenvironment (pdl1, pdl2) were also significantly (p <0.01, t-test) correlated to cov receptors (supl fig   2d) .we 3) . ace2 was only found to be significantly positively correlated to macrophage (r = 0.329, p = 1.04e-07) immune infiltrate in kirp subtype ( figure 4a ). on the other hand, dpp4 was significantly positively and negatively correlated to macrophage (r = 0.219, p = 5.13e-04) and b cell (r = -0.147, p = 1.85e-02), cd8+ t cell (r = 0.162, p = 9.17e-03) immune infiltrate in kirp subtype ( figure 4b ). we observed either negative or no correlation of tmprss2 expression with immune infiltrates in renal carcinoma subtypes (suppl fig 3a) . we also found a significant correlation of anpep and enpep with immune filtrate in kirc as compared to kirp tumors (suppl fig 3b and   3c ). immune infiltrates of b cells, cd8+ t cells, macrophages, and dcs significantly correlated with these receptors except tmprss2 in kich tumors ( figure 4 and suppl fig 3) .these results strongly suggest a variable host immune response to cov infection depending upon the renal carcinoma subtypes.there is an increased risk of coronavirus related fatalities in the subpopulation with any underlying health conditions or comorbidities. the risk factors for an increased susceptibility for cov infection include, but not limited to, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking and cancer .cancer patients especially those undergoing chemotherapy and other anti-cancer treatment have increased risk of mortality due to cov infection (lee et al., 2020) . the precise mechanism of increased severity in cancer remains unclear. in this study, we did landscape profiling of cov receptors and co-receptors (viz ace2, tmprss2, anpep, enpep, and dpp4) in various normal and cancer cells.our findings are in concordance with previous studies reporting ace2 expression in stratified epithelial cells, colon, lung, liver, and kidney. single-stranded rna viruses can have multiple receptors for their host cell entry (zhang et al., 2019) . sars-cov utilizes ace2, cd209, clec4g, and clec4m for its infection to host (marzi et al., 2004; yang et al., 2004; gramberg et al., 2005; wang et al., 2008) . a recent study has suggested a few other receptors such as dpp4, anpep, enpep, and tmprss2 as co-receptors/auxiliary proteins to complement ace2 in initiating sar-cov-2 infection (qi et al., 2020) . we analyzed the data available on the gtex portal and observed the co-occurrence of these receptors in the small intestine and kidney at both rna and protein levels.corona infection is a multiorgan diseased condition and not limited to the lungs. few studies have reported low levels of ace2, in lung parenchyma as compared to other normal tissues (jia et al., 2005; qi et al., 2020) . cell type specificity also exists for ace2 expression, such as in lung expression is mainly in alveolar cells (type 2 pneumocytes) and immune cells (b cells, t cells or myeloid cells) (qi et al., 2020) . in kidneys, most of the cells of proximal collecting tubules and proximal straight tubules exhibit increased expression. and enpep along with ace2 receptors. we found that the expression of these receptors is inversely correlated to tumor stage and varies by molecular subtypes in renal carcinoma.as host immune response is crucial to eradicating viral infection, immunological aspects related to these receptors cannot be overlooked. we observed that cov receptors tend to show a high correlation with immune signatures in most cancer types. we further explored the possibility, whether cov receptors are involved in modulating tumor immunity. our analysis revealed for the first time that these receptors were correlated with immune cell infiltration in renal carcinoma. our findings supported the immunoregulatory functions as follows: ace2, dpp4, anpep, and enpep expression is closely related to the infiltration level of b cells, cd8+ t cell, macrophage, neutrophil, and dendritic cell. cytokine storm has been well-defined and described with the pathogenesis of the disease. chemokines are involved in several biological processes, such as the development of innate and acquired immunity, embryogenesis, and cancer metastasis (coperchini et al., 2020) . these chemokines along with cytokines recruit different immune cells (poeta et al., 2019) . we found that ace2 and dpp4 were highly expressed and significantly correlated to the innate and adaptive immunity-related cells, as well as il-10, il-6, cxcl10, ccl2-ccl5, tgfb1 in kirc tumors only. upregulation of cxcl10 can enhance the levels of tumor-infiltrating cd8+ t cell and natural killer cells (humblin and kamphorst, 2019; kikuchi et al., 2019; petty et al., 2019) . t regulatory cells and macrophages get recruited by ccl5 walens et al., 2019) . these results indicate that cov receptors can play an important role in cellular immunity by modulating the immune infiltrate via cytokines and chemokines secretion.cancer cells also can evade the immune system by promoting t cell dysfunction and exhaustion (jiang et al., 2015; thommen and schumacher, 2018) . we analyzed the expression of inhibitory immune-checkpoint molecules in renal carcinoma subtypes to understand the dysregulation of the tumor microenvironment. our results revealed that the expressions of various markers of exhausted t cells (cd137, pd1, ctla4) andimmunosuppressive microenvironment (pdl1, pdl2) are highly correlated to cov receptors in kirc tumors. therefore, targeting these cov receptors along with immune checkpoint inhibitors in coronavirus positive kirc patients can be beneficial.our study has some limitations as our findings are based on correlation and associations drawn on analysis of data extracted from several public databases. further experiments are warranted to confirm the role of cov receptors in immune modulation of renal carcinoma.in conclusion, our bioinformatics analysis revealed that renal carcinoma patients might be more susceptible to cov infection. we found evidence that tmprss2 may not be the auxiliary protein for coronavirus infection in renal carcinoma. ace2 and dpp4 increased expression in renal carcinoma tissues as compared to normal kidney. this association suggests that these patients are at increased risk of case related fatalities than healthy subjects. ace2, dpp4, anpep, and enpep each associated with a high level of immune infiltration, inflammatory chemokines, cytokines and markers of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and t cell exhaustion in kirc tumors. our study indicates that cov receptors may play an important role in modulating the immune infiltrate and hence cellular immunity in renal carcinoma.we downloaded rna-seq gene expression profiling datasets from the genotype-tissueexpression study (gtex consortium) for human normal tissues. the normalized rna-seq data in transcripts per million (tpm) was utilized for further analysis. we also downloaded rna-seq gene expression profiling datasets from the cancer genome atlas (tcga) (https://www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) (rsem normalized) for human normal and cancer tissues.the human protein atlas database (https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/tissue) includes expression profiles of rna and protein corresponding to ∼ 80% of the human protein-coding genes of specific tissues and organs. we downloaded the immunohistochemistry (ihc) data analysis of cov receptors protein in cancer and normal tissues (pmid: 24309898). the score of ihc-based protein expression was determined as the fraction of positive cells defined in different tissues: 0 = 0-1%, 1 = 2-25%, 2 = 26-75%, 3 > 75% and intensity: 0 = negative, 1 = weak, 2 = moderate, and 3 = strong staining. we utilized the combined data of positive fraction and intensity, which is represented as high (3), moderate (2), low (1) or no (0) staining. the ihc data representation for normal tissues was presented as staining of the protein. for carcinoma tissues, we used the percentage positivity based on tumor tissues with high or moderate staining compared to low or no staining detected. representative images of normal kidney and renal tumor tissues were also acquired from the same source.for analyses of interactions among cov receptors, the string database, which enables analysis for the structural and functional component of proteins (szklarczyk et al., 2017) was used. the sources for establishing the interactions and enrichment of molecular, functional processes were text mining, experiments, databases, co-expression, neighbourhood, andco-occurrence, and 0.4 was set as the cut-off criterion.the tumor immune system interaction database (tisidb) (http://cis.hku.hk/tisidb/) platform was used to analyze the correlation of ace2 with other cov receptors (dpp4, anpep, enpep, tmprss2) expression in different renal carcinoma subtypes. the correlation and association of cov receptors with tumor stage, molecular subtypes, and immuno-subtypes of renal carcinoma were also analyzed using the tisidb interface.the tumor immune estimation resource (timer) (https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/) platform comprised of the immune infiltrate data from the tcga patients (li et al., 2016 (li et al., , 2017 ) was used to investigate the association between cov receptors expression and the infiltration level of b cell, cd4+ t cell, cd8+ t cell, neutrophil, macrophage and dendritic cell. "diffexp" module was used to investigate the spp1 expression between tumor and adjacent normal tissues across all tcga tumors. the partial spearman's correlation and statistical significance after purity-correction were shown on the generated scatterplots.to computationally infer the infiltration level of specific immune cell types using rna-seq data from renal cell carcinoma samples from tcga, as described previously (chen et al., 2016) , we used a set of 501 genes specifically overexpressed in one of 24 immune cell types (bindea et al., 2013) . we analyzed various immune signatures, including innate immunity, adaptive immunity, pro, and anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory chemokines. the for pan-cancer correlation analyses, we used the set of 10224 rna-seq profiles from 32 different cancer types as featured in our previous study (chen et al., 2018) , using the bindea immune cell signature scores as computed for this study.the correlation among cov receptors expression and with immune infiltration level was determined by the timer interface using spearman's correlation analysis and statistical significance, and the strength of the correlation was determined using the following guide for the absolute value: 0.00-0.19 "weak," 0.20-0.59 "moderate," 0.60-1.0 "strong." the association between the cov receptors expression and molecular or immune-subtypes in renal carcinoma was analyzed by the tisidb interface using the kruskal-wallis test. for preparing the bar graph, the data was analyzed using graphpad™ software (version 6.01, graphpad software, inc., usa) and presented as mean ± sd. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. previously (chen et al., 2016) . three of these subtypes-cc-e.1, cc-e.2, and cc-e.3-are enriched for clear cell rcc cases; four other subtypes-p-e.1a, p-e.1b, p-e.2, and p.cimpe-are enriched for papillary rcc cases; one subtype, ch-e, is enriched for chromophobe rcc cases; and one subtype ("mixed") is not enriched for any of the above. treg cells, cryptosporidiosis is a very common infection in cattle worldwide xiao, 2010) . the agent responsible for this intestinal disease is a protozoan of the genus cryptosporidium. this parasite can infect a wide range of hosts including humans (fayer, 2010; xiao, 2010) . the species c. parvum is considered to be one of the most common entero-pathogenic species in humans and ruminants.in ruminants, which represent a major sector of the agricultural economy in many countries, cryptosporidiosis is a well-recognized cause of neonatal diarrhoea (noordeen et al., 2000; fayer and santín, 2009; silverlås et al., 2010) . the first case reported in cattle was in 1971 (panciera et al., 1971) . now, bovine cryptosporidiosis is considered as one of the major causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea characterized by emission of yellow watery stool, progressive dehydration, growth retardation and possibly death (de graaf et al., 1999) . in contrast, asymptomatic infection http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2014.03.004 0304-4017/© 2014 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. commonly occurs in yearling heifers and mature cows . in cattle, cryptosporidium has become a concern not only because of the direct economic losses associated with the infection, but also from a public health perspective because of the potential for environmental contamination with oocysts and especially contamination of water, an important source of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks as recently reviewed by baldursson and karanis (2011) . currently, no drug therapy is available and the high resistance of cryptosporidium oocysts in the environment makes cryptosporidiosis difficult to control (cacciò and pozio, 2006) .among the 26 cryptosporidium species considered valid, cattle are usually infected with four: c. parvum, c. ryanae, c. bovis and c. andersoni (chalmers and katzer, 2013) . a chronological sequence of species from birth to adulthood has been suggested by some authors, with c. parvum being predominant in pre-weaned dairy calves (<2 months), c. ryanae and c. bovis occurring mainly in weaned animals and c. andersoni becoming dominant in adult cows (santín et al., 2004 šlapeta, 2006; fayer, 2010; xiao, 2010) . for other authors the succession according to the age of dairy calves varies according to geographic area and management system adopted (feng et al., 2007; geurden et al., 2007; silverlås and blanco-penedo, 2012) . in belgium, hungary and the usa, the most prevalent species in young dairy calves (<1 month) was c. parvum (geurden et al., 2007; plutzer and karanis, 2007; santín et al., 2008) , whereas in other countries including sweden, india and china, c. bovis was shown to be the most prevalent species in young dairy calves (<1 month) (feng et al., 2007; silverlås et al., 2010) .as far as clinical infection is concerned, c. parvum is frequently recorded as the dominant species in diarrhoeic calves, while other species may occur mainly in subclinical situations (kváč et al., 2006; fayer et al., 2008; santín et al., 2008) . among other common pathogens, e. coli is known to cause diarrhoea in calves younger than 1 week, whereas coronavirus and rotavirus are mainly involved in 1-to-3-week-old diarrhoeic calves (foster and smith, 2009; silverlås et al., 2010) .molecular characterization studies of cryptosporidium species are less numerous in pre-weaned beef calves than in dairy cattle and few data are available specifically for non-diarrhoeic beef calves (geurden et al., 2007; budu-amoako et al., 2012; murakoshi et al., 2012) . cryptosporidium infection is usually considered less prevalent in beef calves than in dairy calves (kváč et al., 2006; geurden et al., 2007) .subtyping c. parvum at the gp60 gene level gives a high number of subtypes, some of them having zoonotic implications (plutzer and karanis, 2009; xiao, 2010) . previous studies have shown that cattle could be the main animal reservoir for zoonotic subtypes of c. parvum, i.e. those belonging to families iia and iid (xiao and fayer, 2008; chalmers and giles, 2010) . according to alves et al. (2006) , human infections with iia subtype are especially common in areas where intensive livestock production is found.in france, three longitudinal studies have recently been conducted. follet et al. (2011) reported the succession of species previously mentioned and the presence of different subtypes of c. parvum in dairy calves. the two other studies reported that the species c. bovis can be found early after birth in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic beef calves (rieux et al., 2013a,b) . our current study was a pluri-annual extension of this previous data and was designed to investigate annual patterns in oocyst excretion and in prevalence of cryptosporidium species and genotypes in pre-weaned beef calves in a single beef herd.this study was carried out in a beef cattle farm located in the deux-sèvres region in western france. this herd comprised 52 parthenais-breed cows. the calving season is from september to december. calves are usually born in the barn among the other animals. during the winter, from november to february, the young animals are raised indoors together with their mothers. in march and april, they spend sunny days outside, and from may they are always outdoors. cleaning of premises takes place once a year when animals are outdoors.this study included 25 calves sampled in 2010, 34 calves (16 males and 18 females) sampled in 2011 and 32 calves sampled in december 2012 (table 1) . results from calves sampled in 2010 and females sampled in 2011 were published previously, so they will not be presented in detail here (rieux et al., 2013a,b) . faeces were collected directly from the rectum using sterile plastic gloves once a week from birth to 1 month of age. for each animal, the sampling date, age, animal identification number and the consistency of the faeces (score of 0 or 1, 0: absence of diarrhoea, 1: presence of diarrhoea) were recorded. the samples were transported to the laboratory in a sample pot and then stored at 4 • c for a maximum of 48 h before analysis.samples were done in compliance with the animal welfare and did not cause any pain according to the ethics committee for animal experimentation no. 16 (french referential).one gram of faeces was used for oocyst concentration using ethyl acetate as previously described (castro-hermida et al., 2005) . one aliquot of 10 l of the sediment from each sample was fixed on slides using acetone at 4 • c and processed using an ift commercial kit (merifluor ® cryptosporidium/giardia, meridian bioscience europe, nice, france). the samples were observed by fluorescence microscopy at 400× magnification (geurden et al., 2007 (geurden et al., , 2008 . the number of oocysts per gram of faeces (opg) was calculated using the formula: [number of oocysts seen on slide/(volume of sample examined (ml) × weight of faeces (g))]. the limit of detection of this technique was estimated at 100 opg (1 oocyst seen per slide when using 1 gram of faeces). the mean oocyst excretion per group of calves (mean intensity of infection) was calculated from positive animals.2.3. immunochromatographic assay for rotavirus, coronavirus and e. coli f5 (k99)all diarrhoeic cryptosporidium-ift positive samples from beef calves between 1 and 3 weeks of age from the third cohort were tested with a commercially available dip-stick assay for rotavirus, coronavirus and e. coli f5 (bio k 156, prionics, switzerland). testing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, approximately 0.1 g of faeces was diluted into the reagent provided. a test strip was dipped into the homogeneous suspension and read after 3 and 10 min of contact. the presence of a control line assessing the validity of the test was checked.all ift-positive samples were submitted to dna extraction in order to perform molecular characterization.genomic dna was extracted from 500 l of oocyst suspension using an automatic extractor (maxwell ® mdx 16, promega) with a tissue kit (maxwell ® 16 tissue dna purification kit as1030), after a preliminary grinding step performed with a ribolyser tm (bio-rad ® ).a nested pcr protocol was used to amplify an 830 pb fragment of the ssu rrna gene. the polymerase chain reaction protocol was performed in two steps according to xiao et al. (1999 xiao et al. ( , 2001 . the specific primers used were f1 forward 5 -ttctagagctaatacatgcg-3 and r1 reverse 5 -cccatttccttcgaaacagga-3 for primary pcr and f2 forward 5 -ggaagggttgtatttattagataaag-3 and r2 reverse 5 -aaggagtaaggaacaacctcca-3 for secondary pcr. these amplifications were performed in an icycler thermal cycler from bio-rad ® . amplification products (10 l) were separated on 2% agarose and stained with ethidium bromide.for the samples which were positive using ift but which were negative by pcr, we performed dilutions at 1/10 and 1/100 in order to avoid inhibition. pcr was repeated twice for samples that were found positive using ift but which remained negative with pcr.all isolates from the second and third cohorts were analyzed by pcr-rflp. for the detection and differentiation of cryptosporidium species, the secondary nested pcr products were subjected to restriction digestion in a total of 20 l of reaction mixture with the sspi and mboii restriction enzymes (new england biolabs, beverly, ma, usa) (feng et al., 2007; xiao and ryan, 2008) . all isolates were digested at 37 • c with sspi for 2 h and mboii for 1 h. gel profiles with rflp products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining under uv light. based on the pcr-rflp banding pattern, cryptosporidium speciation was performed in accordance with feng et al. (2007) . for three samples with low oocyst burdens, the results after following the pcr-rflp protocol were equivocal and were therefore confirmed by sequencing.for all samples identified as c. parvum (alone and in combination with another species), a nested pcr protocol was used to amplify a 1000 bp fragment of the gp60 gene in order to identify the subtype. the polymerase chain reaction protocol was performed in two steps in accordance with gatei et al. (2007) . the specific primers were gp60f forward 5 -atagtctccgctgtattc-3 and gp60r1 reverse 5 -ggaaggaacgatgtatct-3 for primary pcr and gp60f2 forward 5 -tccgctgtattctcagcc-3 and gp60r2 reverse 5 -gcagaggaaccagcatc-3 for secondary pcr. these amplifications were performed on an icycler thermal cycler from bio-rad ® . amplification products (10 l) were separated on 2% agarose and stained with ethidium bromide.all the secondary 18s pcr products of the isolates from the first cohort and all the secondary gp60 pcr products obtained were sequenced in both directions. dna sequencing reactions were performed by genoscreen (lille, france) using internal primers of the nested pcr and an abi 3730xl sequencer (applied biosystems, warrington, uk). the sequence alignment was checked for sequencing accuracy using bioedit sequence alignement editor software (version 7.0.9.0). the sequences obtained for each strand were aligned and then were compared with sequences published in the genbank database using blast [basic local alignment search tool, ncbi (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast)].prevalence of excretion in each age group (3-9 days; 10-17 days; 18-23 days; 24-30 days) was compared between years using a 2 test at level (p < 0.05). the comparison of excretion in each age group was made using the non-parametric kruskal-wallis test at level (p < 0.05). statistical analysis was performed using systat 9.1 for windows, 1998, spss inc. (chicago, usa).312 faecal samples were collected from pre-weaned beef calves, aged from 3 to 30 days of age over three (table 1) . 201 faecal samples were microscopically positive for cryptosporidium sp. oocysts, using ift. 92-100% of calves from the three cohorts excreted oocysts on at least one sampling date. the first excretions were observed in two animals from the third cohort at 4 days (2100 and 9400 opg ).the prevalence of cryptosporidium excretion varied depending on the year of sampling (fig. 1) . the highest prevalence for the first cohort of pre-weaned beef calves was recorded when calves were 24-30 days old with 92% of calves being excreting, the corresponding mean arithmetic oocyst excretion was 1.6 × 10 5 opg. for the 2nd cohort, the highest prevalence was recorded when calves were between 17 and 23 days old with 96% [95% ci: 89-100], and the corresponding mean arithmetic oocyst excretion was 2.6 × 10 5 opg (fig. 1) . finally, the maximal prevalence of excretion from calves for the third cohort was recorded when animals were 10-16 days old, with 96.7% [95% ci: 89-100], the corresponding arithmetic mean was 5 × 10 6 opg. moreover, a high prevalence of excretion was observed in the youngest calves (4-9 days old) of the third cohort with 90.4% [95% ci: 79-100] (fig. 1) . prevalences were significantly different in each age group from one year to another (p < 0.01) (fig. 1) . the peak of excretion in the first cohort was recorded later (17-23 days) than in the other cohorts (10-16 days) and the mean number of oocysts at the peak of excretion of the first and second cohorts was lower (9 × 10 5 and 6 × 10 5 opg) than that observed during the third cohort (5 × 10 6 opg; range: 100 to 3.1 × 10 7 ) (fig. 1) . in addition, a high level of excretion was observed in the youngest oocyst-excreting calves (3-9 days) of the third cohort (mean oocyst excretion: 2.5 × 10 6 opg). mean oocyst excretion were significantly different in each age group between years (p < 0.001) (fig. 1) .all of the 201 ift-positive faecal samples from preweaned beef calves from the three cohorts were subjected to molecular analysis with nested pcr ssu rrna. 28 samples from the first cohort were successfully amplified and sequenced after nested pcr ssu rrna and 124 samples (2nd and 3rd cohorts) were successfully amplified and analyzed using a pcr-rflp protocol. 80 samples were identified as c. parvum, with 1, 24 and 55 samples from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cohort respectively. 53 samples were identified as c. bovis, with 25 and 28 samples from the 1st and 2nd cohort respectively. 19 samples were identified as c. ryanae, with 2, 5 and 12 samples from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd cohort respectively (fig. 2a-c) . in addition, 8 mixed infections (4 with c. bovis and c. parvum and 4 with c. bovis and c. ryanae) were identified in 8 calves from the 2nd cohort. mixed infections were not sought in calves from the first cohort and were not found in animals from the third cohort (fig. 2b) .subtyping was performed on samples identified as c. parvum-positive specimens. 51 c. parvum samples from the second (21) and third cohort (30) were used for sequence analysis. sequence analysis of the gp60 gene of isolates from the second cohort revealed 100% identity with the genbank sequence: jf727755.1 the sequence analysis of the gp60 gene of isolates from the third cohort revealed between 99% and 100% identity with the genbank sequences: ef073047.1 and jx183802.1. two different subtypes were thus identified: subtype iiaa15g2r1 in the samples from the second cohort and subtype iiaa18g1r1 in the samples from the third cohort.3.4. prevalence of c. parvum, c. ryanae and c. bovis in relation to calf age over three successive years cryptosporidium parvum was detected from 4 days of age, c. bovis from 11 days of age and c. ryanae from 18 days of age. the prevalence of each species changed with the age of the calves and the year of sampling (fig. 3a-c) . during the first year of sampling, one animal excreted oocysts of c. parvum, whereas calves in the second and third study excreted mainly this species during the first two weeks of life with excretions varying between 83 and 4.9 × 10 6 opg. prevalence of c. parvum decreased when calves were between 24 and 30 days old (fig. 3a) .the excretion dynamic of c. bovis was slightly different. this species was predominant in animals from the first cohort and was undetectable in calves from the third cohort. c. bovis was mainly excreted by calves at 10-30 days of age with an excretion level varying from 2 × 10 4 to 1 × 10 6 opg in the first cohort and lower levels, varying from 6 × 10 4 to 4 × 10 5 opg, in the second cohort (fig. 3b) .the species c. ryanae was noticeably excreted later than the two other species. the first excretions were seen from 18 days of age. animals from the second and third cohorts excreted c. ryanae from 17 to 30 days of age. the highest prevalence was observed in calves around one month of age. the level of excretion of c. ryanae was lower than for the two other species (range: 1 × 10 3 to 2. 2 × 10 5 opg) (fig. 3c) .eight mixed infections were observed in calves from the second cohort when animals were 17-30 days old; the levels of excretion were highly variable with the highest level concerning c. parvum/c. bovis infection with a mean excretion of 9 × 10 5 opg (range: 2.1 × 10 4 to 2 × 10 6 opg).the occurrence of several cryptosporidium species according to the age of the pre-weaned beef calves was black bars of the graph represent the prevalence of excretion of cryptosporidium species in the first cohort, dark grey bars represent the prevalence of excretion in the second cohort and grey bars represent the prevalence of excretion during the third cohort. the mean of oocyst excretion was represented by lines. ( ) represents the first cohort, (····) represents the second cohort and (---) represents the third cohort. graph a represents the evolution of c. parvum, graph b represents the evolution of c. bovis and graph c represents the evolution of c. ryanae.detected pathogens in diarrhoeic samples according to the age from pre-weaned beef calves between 1 and 4 weeks of life from the 3rd cohort using the dipstick assay. observed, with a transition from the species c. parvum and/or c. bovis to c. ryanae.animals from the second and third cohort presented various degrees of clinical signs whereas no clinical cases were observed in the first cohort.mild transient diarrhoea was observed at least on one occasion in 80% (2nd cohort) to 90% (3nd cohort) of calves and the greatest proportion of diarrhoeic samples was seen between 7 and 19 days of age. no mortality was recorded in calves from the 2nd cohort and one calf died with diarrhoea in the 3rd cohort.diarrhoeic samples from calves from the third cohort were also tested for other pathogens (rotavirus, coronavirus and e. coli f5) ( table 2) . 38/40 diarrhoeic samples from 25 calves were identified between 1 and 3 weeks of age (2 diarrhoeic samples were not successfully amplified after nested pcr ssu rrna). three cryptosporidium sp-ift positive samples were found negative with the dip-stick assay. no mono-infections with rotavirus, coronavirus or e. coli were present. mixed infections were present in 15/35 diarrhoeic faecal samples with: rotavirus and c. parvum (n = 5), coronavirus and c. parvum (n = 7), coronavirus and c. ryanae (n = 2) and one diarrhoeic sample with coronavirus, rotavirus, e. coli and c. ryanae.the species c. parvum was found in the majority of diarrhoeic samples: 21 diarrhoeic samples with c. parvum alone and 12 samples with c. parvum and coronavirus or rotavirus were found. the species c. ryanae was found in 2 diarrhoeic samples alone and in 3 diarrhoeic samples in association with rotavirus and/or coronavirus and/or e. coli (table 2) . shedding rates for different cryptosporidium species in diarrhoeic vs. non-diarrhoeic calves from the third cohort were 2 × 10 3 to 1.7 × 10 7 opg vs 8 × 10 2 to 8 × 10 6 opg (c. parvum) and 8 × 10 3 to 9.4 × 10 4 vs. 1.8 × 10 3 to 5.3 × 10 3 opg (c. ryanae).bovine cryptosporidiosis is one of the major causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea. young calves (<1 month of age) are frequently infected with cryptosporidium sp. (quílez et al., 1996) . in france, some epidemiological studies concerning infection with cryptosporidium sp. in calves have recently been conducted (follet et al., 2011; rieux et al., 2013a,b) .our study showed that 92-100% of the pre-weaned beef calves sampled during three successive years were infected with cryptosporidium before one month of age, which is similar to the results reported by santín et al. (2008) in dairy calves. the average levels of excretion of cryptosporidium sp. were also similar to what was reported in dairy calves by silverlås et al. (2010) . however, when including a pluriannual approach, we observed that the peak of excretion could occur at different ages depending on the year of sampling. this peak occurred between 17 and 23 days of age in calves of the 1st cohort while it took place at around two weeks of age (10-16 days) in calves of the 2nd and 3rd cohorts, this latter pattern being in agreement with previous data obtained with c. parvum in dairy calves (santín et al., 2004) . similarly, the highest prevalence of cryptosporidiosis varied from one cohort to another. in the first cohort, the maximum prevalence was seen in animals aged 24-30 days, while these peaks were reached early in calves from the second and third cohorts (between 17-23 and 10-16 days of age, respectively). both the earlier peaks of prevalence and excretion in cohorts 2 and 3 suggest a more intense contamination of the premises, leading to a very early exposure of the calves (silverlås et al., 2010 (silverlås et al., , 2013 . as cryptosporidium oocysts are widely dispersed and can survive for months in the environment (chalmers and giles, 2010) , the build-up of oocysts in a given environment, if not modified by adapted disinfectants or cleaning procedures, may represent a high risk to the newborn animals.numerous studies have shown an age-related sequence of cryptosporidium species in dairy calves. in our study, we identified in beef calves aged less than one month of age the three species commonly reported in young cattle: c. parvum, c. bovis and c. ryanae. several authors have reported that the species c. parvum constitutes the majority of infections in pre-weaned dairy calves, while c. bovis and c. ryanae are found in older or weaned calves (santín et al., 2004 coklin et al., 2009) . for santín et al. (2008) , the first detection of c. bovis and c. ryanae took place later, at 4 and 8 weeks of life respectively, whereas other studies demonstrated earlier excretion of these species (at 2-4 weeks of life) (feng et al., 2007; silverlås et al., 2010) . in our study, we did observe an effect due to age and year of sampling on the distribution of cryptosporidium species in pre-weaned beef calves. calves from the first cohort excreted mainly the species c. bovis between 10 and 30 days of age, whereas none of the calves from the third cohort excreted this species. calves from the second cohort excreted c. parvum and c. bovis with similar age patterns (7-27 and 11-30 days of age respectively) and levels of excretion (500 to 2 × 10 6 opg), whereas calves from the third cohort excreted mainly the species c. parvum from 4 to 26 days of age. the species c. ryanae was distinctly identified in older calves (from 18 to 30 days old) from each cohort and at lower levels of excretion (range: 1 × 10 3 to 2.2 × 10 5 opg). in view of these observations, it is possible that neonatal calves are more susceptible to infection with c. parvum and c. bovis than to infection with c. ryanae or, the higher infection dose in calves could come with a shorter prepatent period because shedding rates could pass the detection level earlier than at a lower dose (silverlås et al., 2013) , as has been described in lambs (blewett et al., 1993; ortega-mora and wright, 1994) . these observations also confirm that the age-related occurrence of cryptosporidium species in calves is not totally well defined and varies according to the survey location, the load of oocysts in the environment and, notably, calf management system (feng et al., 2007; geurden et al., 2007; santín et al., 2008; silverlås et al., 2010; budu-amoako et al., 2012) . the animals involved in our study were all housed together with the calves born earlier in the calving season. this may explain why they were infected with species usually found in older calves, in contrast with the dairy farms, where neonates are usually raised separately from older animals. however, this hypothesis deserves further investigation because the observations of silverlås and blanco-penedo (2012) showed that calves staying with the dam 3 days after birth excreted the same species of cryptosporidium than those immediately removed. here, we also observed differences in distribution of cryptosporidium species in the same cattle herd over time, while animal management parameters remained comparable.regarding clinical signs, calves from the first cohort expressed no clinical signs while 80-90% of calves from the second and third cohort were diarrhoeic on at least one occasion. the three cryptosporidium species were found in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples, although the species found in diarrhoeic samples was mainly c. parvum. the species c. parvum is frequently recorded as the dominant species in diarrhoeic calves, while c. ryanae seems to occur in subclinical situations (kváč et al., 2006; fayer et al., 2008; santín et al., 2008) . the role of c. bovis with regard to diarrhoea is more conflicting as this species has been described in both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples from dairy calves (silverlås et al., 2010) . other enteric viral or bacterial pathogens (e. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus) can be observed in calves during the first 3 weeks of life and can contribute to the severity of cryptosporidiosis (de graaf et al., 1999) . here, among the 40 diarrhoeic samples identified in calves (<3 weeks of age) from the third cohort, 21 were found to be infected with c. parvum only. this observation confirms the clear implication of c. parvum in the occurrence of clinical signs in beef calves less than 3 weeks of age.lastly, the risk to human health posed by cryptosporidium infection in beef calves was investigated. the detection of the zoonotic species c. parvum in beef calves between 4 and 26 days old confirmed the potential role of young beef calves in human cryptosporidiosis suggested by some authors (atwill et al., 2003) . following analysis of a fragment of the gp60 gene to determine c. parvum subtypes, we obtained two subtypes belonging to the iia family. in this study, subtypes iiaa15g2r1 and iiaa18g1r1 were identified. these subtypes were already described in calves (alves et al., 2006; plutzer and karanis, 2007; soba and logar, 2008; wielinga et al., 2008; coklin et al., 2009; follet et al., 2011) . subtype iiaa15g2r1 has been widely reported in calves and humans in several countries such as portugal, slovenia, the netherlands and france (alves et al., 2006; soba and logar, 2008; wielinga et al., 2008; follet et al., 2011; rieux et al., 2013b) . subtype iiaa18g1r1 was described for the first time in one diarrhoeic pre-weaned calf in hungary in 2007 by plutzer and karanis and was also found recently in young diarrhoeic calves in sweden (silverlås et al., 2013) . during our study this subtype was found in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic samples as well. in a given farm, the number of subtypes found can be restricted to only one when no animal movement occurs (brook et al., 2009; silverlås et al., 2013) . in our study, little trading within the cattle herd occurred, but other livestock flocks (dairy goats, meat sheep) were present at the same location and transportation of faecal material through animal workers cannot be ruled out. another explanation could be that the other subtype, iiaa18g2r1, were carried by exchange of faecal material by a new animal entering the herd, such as a bull or by another individual working on the farm. due to unreadable gp60 sequences of some isolates identified as c. parvum, it is also possible that both subtypes had been circulating in calves since the previous year, but that the dominant subtype was subtype iiaa18g2r1. these results suggest that the dominant subtype of c. parvum can vary in the same beef cattle herd from year to year. moreover, this observation confirms previous studies and strongly suggests a possible role for beef calves as a reservoir for human zoonotic isolates of c. parvum in western france.a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111discrepancies between the two test methods for both clinical sites were resolved by allplex rp (seegene, seoul, south korea) at the clinical site in bonn.testing at both clinical sites was performed by trained laboratory personnel, who had shown proficiency with both methods.residual respiratory samples as nasopharyngeal flocked swabs in utm (copan, brescia, italy) received for routine bacterial and viral testing from 445 patients were included in the study. samples were enrolled consecutively according to instrument capacity. clinical samples were included from two study sites after meeting the following inclusion criteria: respiratory samples were collected utilizing flocked swab (floqswabs™,copan, brescia, italy) placed in utm and were sent for viral and/or bacterial testing. the residual volume of all included samples was above 600 μl. all samples were tested by the qiastat rp and the filmarray rp within 4 days of collection when stored at 2-8˚c, and within 90 minutes after thawing when stored at -80 c.the samples were anonymized and assigned a study number linked to patient demographic information, including age, sex and hospitalization status (general practice, hospitalized, pediatric hospital/ward, intensive care unit). the samples had been collected under an institutional review board (irb)-approved protocol, which included a waiver of informed consent for the use of residual anonymized samples. the protocol was approved by ethikkommission an der medizinischen fakultät der rheinischen friedrich-wilhelms-universität bonn under the approval 052/18 and by de videnskabsetiske komiteer center for sundhed, region hovedstaden under the approval h-18001793.the qiastat dx system is a new highly multiplexed platform for integrated nucleic acid extraction and multiplex, rt-real-time pcr detection. the qiastat rp (catalogue number 691211) is designed to run on the qiastat diagcore analyzer testing respiratory samples from individuals with signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection. each qiastat rp cartridge contains a full process internal control (ic), which is a ms2 bacteriophage that is included in dried format and gets automatically rehydrated upon sample loading. the ic verifies all steps of the analysis process during testing, including sample resuspension/homogenization, lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, and pcr. the cartridge has two distinct loading ports and can be inoculated directly with a dry swab or with transport medium. in brief, samples were homogenized by vigorous inversion of the vial and 300 μl utm was transferred into the assay cartridge using the provided transfer pipette. the inoculated cartridge was placed on the instrument. the test started automatically and ran for 69 minutes. upon completing the test and ejecting the cartridge, the analyzer interpreted results and displayed a test summary. the analyzer will also report errors that may occur during processing. amplification curves and cycle threshold (ct) values can be viewed for detected pathogens and for the ic. a report can be printed or exported to an external usb storage device. the analyzer can be bidirectionally connected to laboratory information systems.the the filmarray rp is a multiplex sample-to-answer pcr panel that tests for 20 viral and bacterial pathogens on nasopharyngeal swabs in utm at a time. a sample volume of 300 μl is required for the testing with approximately two minutes of hands-on-time in the set-up of the test.the system consists of one to eight modules (biofire flimarray torch, salt lake city, utah, usa) that that allows for time independent parallel testing of one sample per module. the test runs for approximately 65 minutes. a report can be printed or exported to an external usb storage device. the analyzer can be bidirectionally connected to laboratory information systems.the for human coronavirus hku1 the filmarray rp assay was accepted as correct as the pathogen is not included in the panel on the allplex rp.samples that yielded discordant results between the qiastat rp and the filmarray rp were discrepancy tested by the allplex rp assay.the allplex rp is a rt-pcr assay that tests for 19 viral and seven bacterial pathogens on nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage at a time.the allplex rp runs on the seegene workflow that consists of a module for nucleic acid extraction and pcr setup, a 96-well pcr thermocycler and a computer for interpretation and reporting with a total sample-to-answer time in less than one day.the the allplex rp assay was used as the comparator method for primate bocaparvovirus 1+2, as this analyte is not included in the filmarray rp panel and the allplex rp results were accepted as correct.sensitivity and specificity are reported as the qiastat rp could be compared to a combined result from the filmarray rp and the allplex rp. results are reported as true positive (tp), false positive (fp), false negative (fn) and true negative (tn) results. binomial two-sided 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the wilson score method.for human coronavirus hku1 and primate bocaparvovius 1+2 results were compared by calculation of positive percent agreement (ppa) and negative percent agreement (npa) as only results from the qiastat rp and either the filmarray rp or allplex rp were available. primate bocaparvovirus 1+2 is not included as a target in the filmarray rp and the human coronavirus hku1 is not included in the allplex rp making it impossible to determine the sensitivity and specificity for these two targets. accordingly, overall agreement is also reported as ppa and npa as sensitivity and specificity was not determined for all targets.the ppa represent how often a new test (nt) agrees with a non-reference standard (nrs) and is calculated as ppa = "nt and nrs positive" / ("nt and nrs positive" + "nt negative and nrs positive"), whereas the npa is calculated as npa = "nt and nrs negative" / ("nt and nrs negative" + "nt positive and nrs negative").445 patients were included in the study. gender distribution was almost equal with 223 female patients and 222 male patients. 122 patients (27.4%) were younger than six years, 56 patients (12.6%) were between six and 21 years, 124 patients (27.9%) were between 22 and 49 years and 137 patients (30.8%) were 50 years or older. no age information was available for six patients (1.3%). the majority of samples, 307 (69.0%) were referred for testing by general practitioners. 106 samples (23.8%) were from hospitalized patients, 30 (6.8%) were from a pediatrics hospital/ward and two samples (0.4%) came from an intensive care unit. all patients had presented with signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection.the qiastat rp detected one or more potential pathogens in 333 (74.8%) of the 445 tested samples (table 1 ) for a total of 415 pathogens ( table 2) . multiple pathogens were detected in 19.5% of the positive samples (65/333), and the highest number of pathogens detected in a single sample was five (human respirovirus 3, human orthorubulavirus 4, human coronavirus oc43, rhino-/enterovirus and primate bocaparvovirus 1+2). the majority of multiple infection samples contained two pathogens, which was the case for 53/65 samples (81.5%). the qiastat rp detected a bacterial pathogen in 7.6% of all samples (34/445). in 25 out of 34 samples only bacteria were detected and in the remaining nine samples, additional viral pathogens were detected (four samples with two pathogens, four samples with three pathogens and one sample with four pathogens).the number of each potential pathogen detected by the qiastat rp in co-infections, by hospitalization and by age group is presented in table 2 . the most frequently detected pathogen was human orthopneumovirus, which was detected in 98 samples, 71 of which (72.4%) came from patients less than 6 years of age. the second most common pathogen was influenza a virus, which was detected in 75 samples, equally distributed between the h1 pdm2009 and h3n2 strains. rhino-/enterovirus was detected in 63 samples and influenza b virus was detected in 51 samples, highlighting the very active influenza b virus season in early 2018.for 440 of 445 specimens (98.9%), a valid result was obtained by the initial qiastat rp testing. five samples (1.1%) were invalid after the first qiastat rp testing, comprising one run aborted by the analyzer (0.22%), three runs with software errors (0.67%), and one run in which the internal control failed to amplify (0.22%). all five samples were retested with the qiastat rp and yielded a valid result after the second qiastat rp testing. the performance characteristics for individual qiastat rp targets before discrepancy resolution are presented in table 3 and the performance characteristics after discrepancy resolution are presented in table 4 .before resolution by discrepancy testing, qiastat rp and filmarray rp agreed on the detection of 376 pathogens in the 445 samples (table 3) . for all pathogens except human mastadenovirus a-g, rhino-/enterovirus, hmpv, influenza a virus no subtype and human respirovirus 3, the agreement was excellent (table 3 ). for human respirovirus 3 and influenza a virus no subtype the total number of positive samples by at least one method was only nine and five respectively. for human mastadenovirus a-g the qiastat rp and filmarray rp agreed on 27 positive samples out of 41 initial positive samples (table 3 ). after discrepancy testing the sensitivity for the qiastat rp was 97.1% (33/34, table 4 ). for rhino-/enterovirus the qiastat rp and filmarray rp agreed on 49 positive samples out of the 71 initial positive samples. after discrepancy testing the sensitivity for the qiastat rp was 94.4% (52/55). for hmpv the qiastat rp and filmarray rp agreed on 19 positive samples out of 21 initial positive samples. after discrepancy testing the sensitivity was 95.0% (19/20). after resolution by discrepancy testing on the allplex rp, a total of 402 pathogen results were considered as true positive (table 4) , of which qiastat rp detected 394, for an overall ppa of 98.0% (95%ci 96.0%-99.1%). after discrepancy testing, the overall npa of the qiastat rp was 99.8% (95%ci 99.6%-99.9).twenty-two pathogens detected by filmarray rp were not detected by qiastat rp ( table 3) . fourteen of these were also not detected by allplex rp and were considered as true negatives, leaving 8 pathogen detections as false negatives (table 4 ). thirty-nine pathogens detected by qiastat rp were not detected by filmarray rp (table 3) . twenty-one of these were also not detected by allplex rp and were considered as false positives ( table 4) .three of the 22 pathogens detected by filmarray rp but not detected by qiastat rp were detected in single infection samples and additional two of the pathogens not detected by qiastat rp were both detected in the same double infection sample. the five pathogens involved were rhino-/enterovirus (three), human mastadenovirus a-g (one) and human orthopneumovirus (one). all off these five pathogens were detected by the discrepancy method (allplex rp). the remaining 17 pathogens not detected by qiastat rp but detected by filmarray rp were from 17 samples with two or more pathogens. three of these 17 pathogens (one hmpv, one influenza a virus, no subtype and one human orthopneumovirus) were detected by the discrepancy method adding up to a total of 8 false negative pathogens. qiastat rp detected 39 pathogens not detected by filmarray rp. 10 of these pathogens were in single infection samples and the detected pathogens were rhino-/enterovirus (n = 1, ct value 27.6), influenza b virus (n = 1, ct value 20.7), influenza a virus, no subtype (n = 1, ct value 34.2), influenza a virus subtype h3n2 (n = 2, ct values 32.7 and 33.7), human orthopneumovirus (n = 2, ct values 28.8 and 32.9) and human mastadenovirus a-g (n = 3, ct values 21.3, 22.4 and 22.7) . the influenza a virus with no detected subtype sample could not be discrepancy tested due to insufficient residual volume and was accordingly considered false positive by the qiastat rp. one additional single-infection pathogen (the rhino-/enterovirus) was considered false positive, as this result could not be confirmed positive by discrepancy testing. the remaining eight single-infection pathogens were confirmed positive by the discrepancy method and thus considered true positives ( it was not possible to assess the sensitivity of the qiastat rp for legionella pneumophila or influenza a virus subtype h1n1 as these organisms were not detected by any of the methods. primate bocaparvovirus 1+2 was detected by the qiastat rp in five specimens, all containing at least one other potential pathogen. the allplex rp confirmed the detected primate bocaparvovirus 1+2 in three of five specimens. because primate bocaparvovirus 1+2 is not included in the panel of the reference method, the results are listed separately and are expressed as ppa/npa.this study demonstrates for the first time the clinical performance of the new qiastat rp assay for detection of 21 respiratory pathogens. by comparison to the filmarray rp, the overall ppa and npa after discrepancy testing were 98.0% (95% ci: 96.0%-99.1%) and 99.8% (95% ci: 99.6%-99.8) respectively. in general, the qiastat rp assay showed excellent agreement with filmarray rp. for all pathogens included on the qiastat rp test menu, except rhino-/ enterovirus (52 tp and 379 tn samples), influenza a virus, no subtype (3 tp and 440 tn samples) and hmpv (19 tp and 425 tn samples), the qiastat rp showed sensitivity/ppa >97% and specificity/npa >99% (table 4 ). the reason for the discordant results for rhino-/enterovirus is not known but may potentially be explained by different diagnostic tests targeting different genetic regions of the rhino/enterovirus genome.the ct values for the pathogen targets present in the discrepant qiastat positive rp and filmarray rp negative samples were detected by qiastat with ct values in the range 30-37, which may be considered as weakly positive. only three targets were detected as qiastat rp positive and filmarray rp negative target with ct values below 30, one human orthopneumovirus (ct 16.2) and two rhino-/enterovirus (ct 26.9 and 29.7) and thus as strong positive samples.it would have been beneficial to resolve discrepancy results by sequencing as this potentially would have clarified the discordant results for rhino-/enterovirus. this was not possible as both the qiastat rp and filmarray rp as assays are performed in sealed samples-to-answer cartridges that are constructed to prevent access to sample material remaining in the cartridge.the qiastat rp assay requires one manual pipetting step to load the patient sample into test cartridge. the test cartridge id and patient/sample id is entered by on-board scanner and the total assay time is approximately 69 minutes. the qiastat dx diagcore analyzer offers a small footprint, traceable internal inhibition controls (by amplification curve as well as ct value), low maintenance requirements and low failure rate as well as seamless connectivity and integration with hospital and laboratory information systems. in addition, the qiastat dx diagcore analyzer offers access to amplification curves and ct values of all detected pathogen targets. the qiastat rp assay cartridge has on-board wet and dry reagents, build-in amplification inhibition controls, detects 21 pathogens in a total of 8 separate reaction chambers, offers a direct dry swab testing option via a separate cartridge input port and stores at room temperature. the qiastat rp is ce ivd marked and fda approval is pending.the syndromic diagnostic approach for arti may provide multiple benefits for the institution (e.g. prudent use of side room isolation facilities, reduced prescription of antimicrobials, targeted use of antivirals) the benefits have been partly described in previous publications. trabattoni et al reported a significant reduction in emergency department (ed) length of stay as well as a significant reduction in hospitalization rate for patients tested by the alere i influenza assay in the ed [22] , and hansen et al reported a positive impact on admittance rate as well as total cost by roche liat influenza testing in the ed setting [14] . brendish et al reported on encouraging findings of poc testing of respiratory viruses, as their studies showed that this testing was associated with a reduced length of hospital stay, resulted in more single doses or brief courses of antibiotics as well as in an improved influenza detection and antiviral use [15] . however, understanding of the full impact on patient management by the syndromic testing approach for arti as well as the cost-benefit will require more prospective outcome studies. such studies would also provide information regarding which patient population(s) will benefit the most from respiratory tract syndromic testing and what the added benefits of syndromic testing compared to selected target testing (e.g. influenza a/b virus, human orthopneumovirus, hmpv, bordetella pertussis or combinations hereof).this study has several limitations. first, as this study was not designed as an epidemiological study, the included clinical samples were not collected consecutively and the detected coinfection rates and the frequency of different pathogens in the co-infected samples may not reflect the actual co-infection rates in the patient population at the time of sample collection. second, as several pathogens, e.g. coronaviruses, b. pertussis, c. pneumoniae and parainfluenzavirus 1-4, were only detected in few clinical samples, the performance of the qiastat rp assay for detection of these pathogens is uncertain.in conclusion, in this first clinical study of the new qiastat rp assay performed in two diagnostic laboratories providing 445 clinical samples for analysis, we observed excellent diagnostic accuracy of the qiastat rp assay compared to the comparator (filmarray rp). the qiastat rp assay could potentially impact positively on antimicrobial stewardship, hospital admittance and use of side room contact isolation facilities.in a word, we report a useful information as to the etiology and evolution of canine 40 coronavirus in china based on the available sequences, which is urgent for the devise 41 of future effective disease prevention and control strategies.coronaviruses, as single-stranded rna viruses, have been widely detected in a 46 variety of mammals and several birds [1, 2] . its genome has ranged from 26 to 32 kb in 47 kit (cw biotech, jiangsu, china) protein among ccov-iia strains sequenced here and the classical ccov-iia strains. 165 we found amino acid changes in around 45 residues, most of these are located in s1 ccov-ii groups ( figure 3b ). in contrast, the sequence of s2 domain of 189 b906_zj_2019 clustered closely with these strains identified in this study which 190 belong to ccov-iia ( figure 3c ). k-h l ja pa n d q 0 1 0 9 2 1 f c o v 7 9 -1 1 4 6 k p 1 4 3 5 0 7 f c o v 2 7 c 2 0 1 3 d 1 3 0 9 6 c c o v in s a v c -1 k c 1 7 5 3 3 9 1 7 1 g e rm a n y 1 9 7 1 ree scale: 0.1blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) cultures derived from healthy controls. the strain hsr-1 of sars-cov, used in this study, was obtained by inoculating vero cells with a sputum specimen from an italian patient affected by a severe form of pneumonia of unknown etiology, who had a history of travel from vietnam to italy in march 2003 [5] . pbmcs were chosen to perform the experiments because several studies indicated that sars-cov is able to infect in vitro pbmcs and to determine virus-specific rna production [6] [7] [8] . in order to make a comparison, we performed control experiments in which the same cells were induced to produce ifn by vesicular stomatitis (vsv) and newcastle disease (ndv) viruses. we used these viruses as control because of their high and wellknown capacity of ifn induction.briefly, human pbmcs were isolated from buffy coats of 10 blood donors provided by the blood bank of the 'sapienza' university of rome. blood was collected in edta tubes, and pbmcs were separated by ficoll-hypaque gradient sedimentation. pbmcs (5 ! 10 6 ) were plated in 6well plates (falcon 353046 multiwell 6-well; becton-dickinson, franklin lakes, n.j., usa) and infected with 100 l of sars-cov at a moi of 0.1 in serum-free medium mem (sial, italy) supplemented with 2 m m l -glutamine (sial, italy) and 50 g/ml of gentamycin (sial, italy). after adsorption at 37° for 1 h, the excess virus inoculum was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the wells topped up with medium plus 2% fetal calf serum (sial, italy) to 0.1 ml/well. cells were cultured for 24 and 48 h after infection with sars-cov. as stated before, control experiments with vsv and ndv at the same moi were carried out. for safety precautions, all culture supernatants, collected 24 and 48 h post-infection (p.i.), were uv irradiated for 1 h to inactivate residual infectious virus before ifn induction analysis. cells were collected 24 and 48 h after virus infection and were frozen at -80° for ifn-␣ subtype mrna expression analysis (see below).ifn activity was determined at 24 and 48 h p.i. evaluating the reduction of cytopathic effect on bovine madin-darby bovine kidney cells by vsv. in brief, 3 ! 10 4 cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plates (falcon 353072 microtest 96, becton dickinson) and incubated with threefold serial dilution of supernatant samples for 18 h at 37°. following incubation, cells were challenged with vsv at a moi of 0.5 and the plates were incubated at 37° for 18 h. virus-induced cytopathic effects were assessed by microscopic examination. the monolayer's cell was then stained with crystal violet in 20% ethanol. the dye taken up by the cells was eluted with 33% acetic acid and its absorbance measured at 540 nm with an elisa microplate reader. ifn concentrations were expressed as inverse dilution that provided 50% of cell protection against viral-induced cytopathic effect. figure 1 a shows the ifn-inducing capacity of sars-cov (hsr-1 strain). it can be seen that vsv and ndv induce a higher yield of ifn activity at both 24 and 48 h after infection of pbmcs derived from healthy donors than sars-cov (p ! 0.05 by student's t test).next, we characterized the antiviral activity in the supernatant of pbmc cultures stimulated with sars-cov by analyzing the ifn-␣ , -␤ and -␥ production using different elisa kits (human ifn-␣ , -␥ elisa kits, pbl biomedical laboratories, tema ricerca, italy). assays were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer's instructions. the results show that sars-cov elicits a significantly lower production of ifn-␣ and -␤ compared to vsv and ndv (p ! 0.05 by student's t test; fig. 1 b, c). the only exception being the amount of ifn-␤ induced at 24 h by sars-cov which is lower, but not significantly, than that induced by ndv.ifn-␥ levels in supernatant cultures from pbmcs infected with sars-cov show no significant differences compared to those induced by vsv or ndv ( fig. 1 d) . however, there was again a trend towards lower production of ifn-␥ in pbmcs infected with sars-cov, compared to vsv and ndv. in addition, we observed higher levels of ifn-␤ in supernatants of pbmcs infected with sars-cov at 24 h than at 48 h whereas ifn-␣ and -␥ levels remained rather stable up to day 2 p.i.next we investigated the transcriptional induction of the main ifn-␣ subtypes in pbmcs infected with sars-cov by real-time reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr taqman) using the abi 7000 sequence detector (applied biosystems, monza, italy). briefly, total cellular rna was extracted from 5 ! 10 6 cells using phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate reagent (trizol, gibco brl, grand island, n.y., usa), following the manufacturer's instructions. rna was then reverse transcribed using a high-capacity cdna archive kit (applied biosystems). next, we added the following primer pair and probes for ifn-␣ subtypes [9] to the universal pcr master mix (applied biosystems) at 300 and 100 n m , respectively, in a final volume of 50 l.the co-amplification of the ␤ -glucuronidase gene (assay-on-demand, hs99999908_m1, applied biosystems) was used to control the total amount of rna extracted from pbmcs. the relative amount of each transcript, normalized to ␤ -glucuronidase mrna, was calculated by using the arithmetic formula 2 -⌬ ct or 2 -⌬ ⌬ ct according to the supplier's guidelines (applied biosystems).pbmcs isolated from healthy donors were found to express a low quantity of ifn-␣ subtypes. this constitutive expression is variable depending on the examined ifn-␣ subtype. specifically the ifn-␣ subtype values in unstimulated pbmcs, determined using the equation 2 -⌬ ct according to the supplier's guidelines, range between 0.25 and 1.56 for the healthy subjects.the results also show, for the first time to our knowledge, that sars-cov in vitro infection of pbmcs leads to the transcriptional induction of several ifn-␣ subtypes and that they are induced to a different extent ( fig. 2 a) . in particular, among the subtypes detected at 24 h p.i., ifn-␣ 2 and -6 are the major transcripts followed by ifn-␣ 13/1 and finally ifn-␣ 5, -8, -10, -17, and -21 as minor transcribed subtypes. the difference between the level of expression of ifn-␣ subtypes 2, 6 and 13/1 measured at 24 h after infection with sars-cov is statistically significant (p ! 0.05 by student's t test). all the ifn-␣ subtypes reached much higher levels at 48 h p.i. than those measured in controls and at 24 h p.i. (p ! 0.05 by student's t test).as expected, a significant production of ifn-␣ subtypes in pbmcs infected with vsv or ndv at 24 h as well as at 48 h was observed (p ! 0.05 by student's t test; fig. 2 b, c) . interestingly, we found that, over a time course of 24 and 48 h of infection, lower levels of all of the ifn-␣ subtypes investigated were transcribed in pbmcs infected with sars-cov when compared with those induced by vsv and ndv. the ratio values, expressed as log values, in the ifn-␣ subtype levels between vsv and sars-cov after pbmcs infection were variable. the mean value at 24 h was 2.38 (range 1.93-2.78) and at 48 h it was 0.94 (range 0.6-1.2). the same analysis performed with ndv revealed that mean value at 24 and 48 h were 0.42 and 0.53, respectively. expression of ifn-␣ subtype mrnas in pbmcs from 10 healthy donors after sars coronavirus (cov, hsr1 strain) infection at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 ( a ). the same experiments were conducted with vsv and ndv viruses ( b , c ). at both 24 and 48 h after infection, cells were harvested and rna was isolated using trizol reagent. taqman reverse transcriptase pcr was used to quantify ifn-␣ subtype mrnas. the data, normalized to ␤ -glucuronidase mrna, were calculated by using the arithmetic formula 2 -⌬ ⌬ ct according to the supplier's guidelines. * ifn q = ifn-␣ 5, -10, -17, and -21. a * * p ! 0.05 compared with expression of ifn-␣ subtypes in uninfected pbmcs (controls) using student's t test. * * * p ! 0.05 compared with expression of ifn-␣ subtypes in uninfected pbmcs (controls) and at 24 h p.i. using student's t test. b , c * * p ! 0.05 compared with expression of ifn-␣ subtypes in pbmcs infected with sars-cov using student's t test.such findings, which are consistent with previous observations [9] , support the idea that the expression level of each ifn-␣ subtype is dependent on the kind of viral stimulus. to further support the view that sars-cov is a poor inducer of ifn-␣ subtypes and to gain new insights into the phenomenon, the increase of all ifn-␣ subtypes was measured in pbmcs collected from 5 healthy donors after transfection with double-stranded rna synthetic analogue such as polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly-ic) for 24 h. the results of these experiments are shown in figure 3 where it can be seen that relevant amounts of different ifn-␣ subtypes can be measured in cells transfected as above. this observation indirectly underlines that sars-cov infection of pbmcs was accompanied by a low induction of ifn-␣ mrna subtypes and suggests that toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) together with other pattern recognition receptors could be involved in the signaling leading to expression of type i ifn in pbmcs.altogether, the data presented in this study, along with previous results [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , demonstrate that sars-cov is a weak inducer of ifn-␣ , -␤ and -␥ . the potential limitations of our study include the fact that we did not compare ifn response in sars-cov-infected pbmcs with those in other relevant human virus. in line with this, it has been reported that in contrast to human coronavirus 229e and influenza a virus (h1n1) there was little or no induction of ifn-␤ in sars-cov-infected macrophages [20] . moreover, it has been shown that sars-cov infection of primary human macrophages is associated with a strong induction of chemokines without an associate type i ifn response compared to h5n1 infection [21] . this finding is consistent with the observation that sars-cov proteins that prevent ifn induction do exist [22] [23] [24] . in particular, the expression of nsp1 protein of sars-cov prevents sendai virus-induced endogenous ifn-␤ mrna accumulation without inhibiting dimerization of ifn regulatory factor 3, a protein that is essential for the activation of the ifn-␤ promoter [22] . furthermore, nsp1 expression promotes degradation of rna transcripts and host endogenous mrnas, leading to a stronger host protein synthesis inhibition. in addition, kopecky-bromberg et al. [24] found that sars-cov open reading frame (orf) 3b, orf 6, and n proteins inhibit the expression of irf-3, suggesting that, like other highly pathogenic viruses, sars-cov genome encodes more than one protein able to inhibit ifn.therefore, altogether these results may help to explain the rapid rise in virus titers during the initial phase of sars disease. in agreement with the above consider-ation, it has been reported that several ifn-stimulated genes, such as pkr, gbp-1/2, cxl-10/11, and jak/stat signal pathway were down-regulated in sars patients with acute severe phase compared to patients with the convalescent phase [11] .however, in contrast with our results and many other results obtained with in vitro experiments [10, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , it has been recently demonstrated that sars-cov induced a wide range of type i ifns and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 in the lungs of macaques [25] . moreover, it has also been reported by okabayashi et al. [26] that the ifn system was not suppressed by sars-cov infection. the reasons for these discrepancies are still unclear. several factors should be taken into account. these include differences in: (i) cells types used to investigate sars-cov capability to induce ifn; (ii) methods employed to determine ifn induction; (iii) timing of sample collections for the analysis of ifn induction with respect to sars-cov infections, and (iv) type of virus used to make a comparison with ifn production in sars-cov infection. further studies are required to gain a better understanding of the activation of ifn system during sars-cov infection.importantly, the results of this study also demonstrate that lower levels of all of the ifn-␣ subtypes investigated were transcribed in pbmcs infected with sars-cov, in contrast with those induced by vsv and ndv. in addition, we observed that sars-cov induce a characteristic profile of ifn-␣ subtype production.it is generally believed that the transcription of different ifn-␣ subtypes is modulated through multiple signaling pathways depending on the virus and the type of cells infected. however, the expression and function of ifn-␣ subtypes during infection with highly pathogenic viruses have been poorly investigated. interestingly, hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection has been reported to be associated with low ifn-␣ 5 mrna levels, which is the main ifn-␣ subtype expressed in the liver [27] . our results show that ifn-␣ 5 mrna production at 24 h p.i. was lower compared to the other ifn-␣ subtypes investigated, when induced with sars-cov too. on the contrary, the levels of ifn-␣ 6 and -2 are higher, although it has been reported that ifn-␣ 6 is up to 52 times less activated than ifn-␣ 2 after infections of pbmcs with either herpes simplex virus or other different viruses of the paramixoviridae family [9] .it is well known that different ifn-␣ subtypes possess distinct antiviral and antiproliferative effects both in vitro and in vivo [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . it has been reported that ifn-␣ 8 has the most potent antiviral activity against murine encephalomyelitis virus in various human cell lines, while ifn-␣ 1 is the least efficient [33] . in agreement, koyama et al. [34] demonstrated that ifn-␣ 8 was the most effective of the ifn-␣ subfamily against intracellular hepatitis c virus replication.in light of the above findings, the fact that sars-cov induced lower levels of ifn-␣ 8 compared to ifn-␣ 2, -6 and -13/1 could suggest a scenario in which during sars the virus affect selectively the expression of specific ifn-␣ subtypes with the most biological activity. the impaired expression of specific ifn-␣ subtypes caused by sars-cov could contribute to the main immunopathological processes involved in sars. a better understanding of sars-cov strategies to alter ifn-␣ subtype expression may elucidate the mechanism underlying virusinduced airway disease.in summary, our data, together with previous results, demonstrate that sars-cov (hsr-1 strain) induces a weak ifn response in comparison with well-established ifn-inducing viruses, such as those for vsv and ndv. this phenomenon has also been described for murine hepatitis coronavirus, which is closely related to sars-cov [14] . interestingly, our results further indicate that sars-cov-induced activation of the ifn system in human pbmcs is associated with a selective expression of individual ifn-␣ subtypes, ifn-␣ 2 and -6 being the most abundant subtypes detected at 24 h p.i. our results will hopefully make a contribution to further studies of sars pathogenesis.porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) is an acute and highly contagious enteric infectious disease characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration in pigs of all ages, but especially in newborn piglets [1, 2] . pedv was first reported in england in 1971 [3] and then detected in japan in 1982 and subsequently confirmed in other southeastern asian countries [4] . in the usa, pedv was first reported in 2013 and has since rapidly spread throughout the country [5, 6] . in china, the incidence of pedv outbreaks has rapidly increased since 2010, especially among newborn piglets aged from a few hours to one week, often resulting in death due to watery diarrhea and dehydration [7, 8] . although the use of inactivated and attenuated vaccines may have helped to reduce the prevalence of disease, pedv has continually emerged, causing tremendous losses to the swine industry in china [9] .pedv, a member of the genus alphacoronavirus in the family coronaviridae, has a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome of approximately 28 kb encoding four structural proteins: the spike (s), nucleocapsid (n), envelope (e), and membrane (m) proteins [10, 11] . the s protein is a glycoprotein consisting of 1383-1387 amino acids (aa) on the viral surface, which is composed of four regions, a signal peptide (aa , an extracellular region, a transmembrane domain (aa 1,334-1,356), and a short x. wang [12] . unlike other coronaviruses (i.e., murine coronavirus and bovine coronavirus), the s protein of pedv cannot be cleaved into s1 and s2 domains after pedv maturation. thus, the s1 domain (residues 1-789) and s2 domain (aa 790-1383) of pedv are artificially defined based on homology to other coronavirus s proteins [13, 14] . the s protein is responsible for binding and fusion of the virus to the host cells. it therefore not only determines cellular tropism but also plays a vital role in inducing production of neutralizing antibodies in the host [15, 16] . the s gene of pedv is often used to evaluate the genetic diversity of coronaviruses [17, 18] . based on phylogenetic analysis of the full-length s sequences isolated in china, pedvs can be divided into two genotypes, g1 and g2 [19] . furthermore, pedv detected in china from 2010 to 2012 were mostly variant strains (most belonging to subtype g2) that differed genetically from the cv777 vaccine strain (belonging to subtype g1) [20] . however, many pig herds vaccinated with inactivated or attenuated cv777 vaccines still experienced high mortality rates among newborn piglets [17, 21] . therefore, further evaluation of the immunogenicity and antigenic relationships of pedv subtypes g1 and g2 is of vital importance. in the present study, we expressed the full-length s gene in a eukaryotic expression system, prepared anti-s polyclonal antibodies (pabs), and performed subsequent experiments to investigate differences in antigenicity between the pedv subtypes to determine if mutations in the s gene are the cause of immunization failure. the findings of this study also lay a foundation for further study of the function of the s protein and to facilitate development of pabs against pedv.the pedv g1 cv777 vaccine strain (genbank accession number: kt323979) was preserved at harbin veterinary research institute (harbin, china). pedv g2 strain lnct2 (genbank accession number: kt323980) was isolated in vero e6 cells in our laboratory. vero e6 cells and hek 293t cell were cultured in gibco ò dulbecco's modified eagle medium (dmem; thermo fisher scientific, inc., waltham, ma, usa) with 10 % fetal bovine serum (thermo fisher scientific, inc.) and maintained at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % co 2 . the expression vector paav-ires-hrgfp was kindly provided by professor shibo jiang (fudan university, shanghai, china). x-tremegene hp dna transfection reagent was purchased from roche diagnostics gmbh (mannheim, germany). mouse monoclonal anti-flag ò antibody produced in mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)conjugated goat anti-mouse igg were purchased from sigma-aldrich corporation (st. louis, mo, usa). anti-dykddddk g1 affinity resin was purchased from genscript usa, inc. (piscataway township, nj, usa). a bca protein assay kit was purchased from thermo fisher scientific, inc. horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg was purchased from zsgb-bio (beijing, china), and irdye@680rd goat anti-mouse igg was purchased from li-cor biosciences (lincoln, ne, usa).full-length s sequences of the pedv cv777 vaccine strain, the classical chinese strain ch/s, and 20 epidemic chinese strains isolated from 2011 to 2015 were used for sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis. homology among multiple aa sequences was analyzed using megalign sequence alignment software (dnastar, inc., madison, wi, usa). a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the aligned nucleotide sequences by the maximumlikelihood method using mega 5.05 statistical analysis software (http://www.megasoftware.net/).to improve the expression levels of the s protein, s gene sequences were codon optimized with the strategy of 'one amino acid-one codon', in which the most preferred codon of the host for a given amino acid is used in the target sequence without changing the amino acid sequences [22] . the nucleotide sequences of the cv777 and lnct2 s genes were edited in accordance with the codon table for homo sapiens in the codon usage database (http://www. kazusa.or.jp/codon/) for optimal expression in hek 293t cells and biochemically synthesized for cv777-s and lnct2-s by beijing genomics institute (beijing, china). full-length sequences of the s gene were cloned between the bamhi and xhoi restriction sites in the paav-ires-hrgfp plasmid. the recombinant plasmids paav-opti cv777 s-flag and paav-opti-lnct2 s-flag were extracted using a plasmid maxi kit (qiagen, hilden, germany).hek 293t cells were cultured to 60 % confluency in a sixwell tissue culture plate at 37°c and then transfected with 2 lg of paav-opti cv777 s-flag and paav-opti lnct2 s-flag together with 2 ll of transfection reagent. after 48 h, the hek 293t cells were collected, treated with ip lysis buffer (thermo fisher scientific, inc.), and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. next, proteins in the supernatants were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) on 10 % gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) membrane for 60 min. the pvdf membrane was blocked with 5 % skim milk for 2 h at 37°c, incubated with mouse anti-flag antibody (dilution, 1:5,000) at 37°c for 1 h, and then further incubated with irdye 680rd goat anti-mouse igg (dilution, 1:4,000) at 37°c for 45 min. the protein bands were visualized using an odyssey ò clx infrared imaging system (li-cor biosciences).hek 293t cells were cultured in 75-cm 2 bottles and transfected with 20 lg of paav-opti pedv-s-flag plasmids. at 48 h post-transfection, the cell lysate was harvested as described above, recombinant s protein was purified using anti-dykddddk g1 affinity resin, the cell lysate was loaded onto a column, and the soluble proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-flag resin. the purified proteins were concentrated using amicon ultra centrifugal filters (molecular weight cutoff, 100 k; emd millipore, billerica, ma, usa). protein concentrations were measured using the bicinchoninic acid (bca) protein assay, and the final products were analyzed by sds-page to confirm purification of the target protein.all animal procedures were approved by the ethics committee of harbin veterinary research institute. three groups of 6-week-old female pathogen-free balb/c mice were respectively immunized subcutaneously three times, at two-week intervals, with 50 lg/mouse of recombinant cv777 s protein, lnct2 s protein formulated in freund's adjuvant (sigma-aldrich corporation) and phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) which was used as a negative control. blood was collected from the tail vein of three mice from each group, and serum samples were prepared prior to the first immunization and at one-week intervals, then stored frozen until assayed.detection of igg antibodies of immunized mice using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)igg antibodies of the immunized mouse's serum samples were detected by elisa [23] . ninety-six-well plates (costar tm ; thermo fisher scientific, inc.) were coated with the purified recombinant cv777 and lnct2 s proteins (200 ng/well) in coating buffer (20 mm na 2 co 3 , 20 mm nahco 3 , ph 9.6) at 4°c overnight. the antigencoated plates were washed three times with pbs with tween ò 20 (pbst) and blocked with 200 ll of 5 % skim milk for 1 h at 37°c. the blocked wells were washed three times with pbst. anti-s lnct2 or anti-s cv777 polyclonal antisera (pabs) collected at different time points were diluted from 1:200 to 1:204,800 with pbs and added to the wells. the plates were incubated at 37°c for 1 h, washed three times with pbst, and hrp-conjugated goat antimice igg (1:5000) was added to each well. the plates were incubated at 37°c for 45 min and washed three times with pbst. then, 100 ll of abts [2,2 0 -azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] peroxidase substrate was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37°c in the dark. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m naf, and the absorbance was read at a wavelength of 405 nm (od 405 ) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) plate reader.confluent monolayers of vero e6 cells in 24-well plates were washed three times with pbs. subsequently, each well was incubated with 10 4 times the median tissue culture infective dose (tcid 50 ) of strain cv777 and/or lnct2 in dmem supplemented with 10 lg of trypsin per ml. after incubation at 37°c for 48 h, monolayers were rinsed with pbs and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4°c for 30 min. they were then washed twice with pbs and incubated with 0.2 % tritonx-100 at 37°c for 20 min. after washing with pbs, the wells were blocked with 1 % bovine serum albumin at 37°c for 2 h, washed three times with pbs, and incubated with cv777 or lnct2 anti-s pabs at 37°c for 1 h. to determine titers, serum samples were initially diluted 400-fold and then serially diluted twofold and rinsed three times with pbs. fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg at a dilution of 1:2,000 in pbs was added to each well. after 45 min of incubation in the dark at 37°c, the plates were washed three times with pbs and incubated with 4 0 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole at a dilution of 1:1,000 for 15 min in the dark at 37°c. after washing three times with pbs, the samples were examined using a digital inverted microscope (thermo fisher scientific, inc.).the cross-reactivity between two types of virus s protein and anti-s protein pabs were assessed by western blot analysis. briefly, vero e6 cells in 75-cm 2 bottles were infected with either the cv777 or lnct2 virus variation between porcine epidemic diarrhea virus subtypes 539 (multiplicity of infection = 1) for 48 h, treated with mammalian protein extraction reagent (thermo fisher scientific, inc.) for 20 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min. the supernatants containing total virus proteins were subjected to 10 % sds-page followed by western blot analysis as described above with anti-s pabs diluted to 1:1,000.the sn test was performed according to the fixed-virusdilution serum method described by reed and muench [24] . briefly, confluent monolayers of vero e6 cells in 96-well plates were washed three times with dmem. pabs against the s protein were inactivated at 56°c for 30 min and then diluted twofold starting at 1:25. they were then mixed with the same volume (50 ll) of 200 tcid 50 of virus diluted with dmem supplemented with 10 lg of trypsin per ml and incubated at 37°c for 1 h. subsequently, 0.1 ml of each virus-serum mixture was inoculated onto vero e6 cell monolayers in 96-well tissue culture plates. after 5 days, specific cytopathic effects (cpes) of cells were observed under an inverted microscope. sn titers were expressed as the titer of the highest serum dilution resulting in 50 % inhibition of pedv infection.one-way analysis of variance was used to determine statistical differences between groups. all statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism version 5.0 software (graphpad software, inc., la jolla, ca, usa). probability (p) values of \0.05 and \0.01 were considered statistically significant and highly statistically significant, respectively.the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic relationships inferred from the aa sequences of the s protein confirmed that the two genotypes were pedv strains g1 and g2. the cv777 vaccine strain was subtype g1, while the lnct2 strain was subtype g2 (fig. 1) expression and purification of full-length recombinant pedv s proteins hek 293t cells in six-well tissue culture plates were transfected with recombinant plasmids (paav-cv777 s-flag and paav-lnct2 s-flag) containing unoptimized s genes and recombinant plasmids (paav-opti cv777 s-flag and paav-opti-lnct2 s-flag) containing optimized s genes. as the s protein was co-expressed with the hrgep protein, the fluorescence intensity reflected the expression level of the s protein.we found that the expression levels of the s proteins were significantly increased by codon optimization ( fig. 2a) . s proteins were detected by western blotting using anti-flag mouse monoclonal antibody (mab) as the primary antibody. the results showed that the recombinant proteins reacted specifically with the primary antibody, and each had a molecular weight of 250 kda (fig. 2b) . these results were in accordance with those of the sds-page analysis with the purified s protein (fig. 2c) .specific igg antibodies were detected in serum samples collected at different time points using an indirect elisa, as described previously. a shown in fig. 3 , igg antibody levels against the s protein in serum from immunized mice were significantly increased at 14 days post-immunization (p \ 0.05) and then highly significantly increased at 21 days, as compared with mice immunized with pbs (p \ 0.01), while there were no significant differences in titers of igg antibodies induced by cv777 and lnct2 s proteins at different time points (p [ 0.05).the elisa results indicated high cross-reactivity between the pabs and the two types of pedv s protein. the titers of anti-s pabs reacting with same subtype s protein reached 1:204,800, while the titers reacting with different subtype s proteins reached 1:102,400. as shown in fig. 4a and b, the od 405 values of anti-s cv777 protein pabs at different dilutions reacting with the cv777 s protein were much higher than those reacting with the lnct2 s protein.the ifa results indicated that pedv s protein was present in the cytoplasm of vero e6 cells (fig. 5a ). both pedv cv777 and lnct2 could induce obvious cpe: vero e6 cell fused with each other and formed syncytia. the structure of cells infected by lnct2 was still clear, while cv777-infected cells were all fused and no single cellular morphology was generally observed. the syncytia of cv777-infected cells were larger than those of lnct2infected cells (fig. 5a and b) .the ifa results confirmed that the anti-s pabs crossreacted with pedv strains cv777 and lnct2. next, we detected the fluorescence intensity of the antigenic crossreaction between the the anti-s protein pabs and the two pedv subtypes. consistent with the elisa results, which showed twofold differences between different pedv subtypes based on titers of the anti-s pabs, the highest titer of anti-s pabs reacting with pedv within subtypes (observing green fluorescence) reached 1:51,200, while the reaction of anti-s pabs and pedv across subtypes only reached 1:25,600 ( table 2) .anti-s pabs bound with the pedv s protein, which was about 220 kda, slightly smaller than the recombinant s protein, as was expected. the results of the western blot assay demonstrated that the anti-s pabs cross-reacted with strains cv777 and lnct2 (fig. 6a and b) , indicating that pedv s proteins had at least one common antigenic epitope across the g1 and g2 strains. the titers of anti-s pabs neutralizing pedv were calculated by the kärber method. the average titer of anti-s cv777 pab, which protected 50 % of cv777-infected cells, was 1:336, while the titer cross-neutralizing lnct2 was 1:150. the average titer of anti-s lnct2 pabs neutralizing lnct2 reached 1:230, while the titer of neutralizing cv777 was 1:387 (fig. 7) . the sn titer of anti-s cv777 pabs neutralizing cv777 strain was more than twofold higher than those neutralizing the lnct2 strain, while the neutralizing titers of anti-s lnct2 pabs were less than twofold of those reacting with the two strains.the ongoing epidemic of pedv has resulted in significant economic losses to the swine industry in asia as well as europe and north america. in china, mortality due to pedv infection can reach 80 %-100 % in piglets less than 10 days old [25] . in the usa, pedv infection has resulted in a loss of almost 10 % of the domestic pig population after only a 1-year epidemic period [26] . located on the surface of pedv, the s protein plays an pivotal role in recognizing receptors of target cells, thereby inducing production of neutralizing antibodies by activated host immune cells [15, 16] . although there have been relatively few studies using full-length sequences of the pedv s protein, most investigating the immunogenicity of the pedv s protein have focused on the s1 region [27] [28] [29] . as pedv s protein cannot be cleaved into s1 and s2 domains after virus maturation and s2 domain may also have potential neutralizing linear and conformational epitopes, the whole s protein with its native conformation might be a better immunogen than the s1 protein. previously, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) spike proteins have been shown to produce high-titer antibodies in mice [30] . in the present study, we successfully expressed and purified the full-length s protein using a eukaryotic expression system. western blot analysis confirmed that the s protein was specifically detected by anti-flag antibodies (fig. 1b) . the ifa indicated that the s protein was expressed at higher levels in hek 293t cells through codon optimization (fig. 1a) , as demonstrated with other coronaviruses [31] . the pedv s protein has 27-30 potential glycosylation sites that help to maintain its biological function [32] . therefore, we chose a eukaryotic expression system that was particularly useful for the production of such a large multi-domain protein requiring complex folding machinery and post-translational modifications [33] so that the structure of the s protein was close to the naturally occurring conformation. other advantages of choosing a eukaryotic expression system were that the expressed fusion protein was soluble as the biological function was maintained [34, 35] . in the present study, we established a method to express and purify the pedv s protein, which can be used not only to evaluate immunogenicity but also to study s protein function. the igg levels of mice immunized with the s protein were significantly increased beginning on post-immunization day 14, and antibody titers reached 1:204,800 on post-immunization day 42 according to the elisa results (fig. 2) . the high igg antibody titers of immunized mice indicated that purified s protein may be a good candidate as an immunogen for pab production and diagnostic methods.since 2010, pedv outbreaks in several provinces have caused significant economic losses to the swine industry in china [7, 8] . although a cv777-inactivated vaccine has been used to immunize swine herds against pedv infection, its efficacy has been rather low [8] . therefore, it is of vital importance to develop a cv777 vaccine that can cross-protect against epidemic strains of the g2 subtype. previous studies have found differences in the antigenicity between pedv cv777 and strains isolated in the usa, and some pig antibodies and mabs showed 4-to 16-fold differences between the titers of the homologous and heterologous strains ccif and vn, as at least one epitope on the n-terminal region of pedv/tgev n protein contributed to this cross-reactivity [36] . however, the mabs used in the previous study were against the n protein, which is not the major antigen that induces production of neutralizing antibodies by host cells. in our previous study, we also found twofold differences in pig antibodies based on sn titers between strains cv7777 and lnct2 (data not shown). a comparison of sequences of two types of pedv g2 s protein from 14 recent chinese epidemic strains from 2011 to 2015 showed that they had 90.4 %-93.8 % sequence identity to the cv777 vaccine strain (table 1) , and sequence variations were concentrated in the n-terminal region of the s protein due to a point mutation, a deletion, and an insertion of four amino acids. the lnct2 strain we chose belonged to the g2 subtype, and its s sequence was 92.3 % identical to that of the cv777 vaccine strain (g1 subtype). the neutralizing epitope domain coe (aa 499-638) had eight different amino acids, and the the luminescence intensity was divided into four degrees: ???, strong; ??, moderate; ?, weak; -, negative epitope motif ss6 (764lqdgqvki771) had two aa mutations between the two pedv subtypes [19] . based on these differences in s protein sequences, we investigated whether mutations in the s protein resulted in a change in antigenicity between strains g1 and g2. the elisa and ifa results showed significant antigenic cross-reactivity between the two pedv subtypes. however, there was approximately a twofold difference in the antigenic responses based on the titers of the pabs. especially, the elisa results showed that reactivity of the anti-s cv777 pabs at different dilutions with the cv777 s protein was much greater than that with the lnct2 s protein, indicating that the ability of anti-s cv777 pabs to crossreact with different subtypes was lower than that of the anti-s lnct2 pabs. in addition, previous studies have shown that the pedv cv777 strain induces larger syncytia than korean strain dr13 and three us strains [36] [37] [38] .comparing the ifa results of the cv777 and lnct strains, we also found a similar phenomenon (fig. 7) . these results indicated that cv777 and epidemic strains may have differences in their ability to enter cells and induce fusion and may have different effects on cell morphology.the results of western blot analysis indicated that the pedv s proteins had at least one common antigenic epitope, allowing the s protein pabs to cross-react with different pedv subtypes. likewise, the results of the sn assay confirmed the presence of high titers of pabs against the s protein that were able to cross-neutralize other pedv subtypes. however, consistent with the elisa and ifa results, there were obvious differences in serum neutralizing responses across subtypes. the sn titer of anti-s cv777 pabs neutralizing strain cv777 was more than twofold higher than the pabs neutralizing strain lnct, while the differences in the neutralizing titers of anti-s lnct2 pabs across subtypes was less than twofold. these results indicate that the neutralizing epitopes of the lnct2 s protein had changed or that new neutralizing epitopes had emerged due to mutations in the s protein. in the subsequent experiments, we found that the 5f7 monoclonal antibody against the lnct s protein could react with strain lnct, but not strain cv777 (data not shown). further studies to identify the mab 5f7 epitope are underway.in summary, the full-length sequence of the pedv s gene was codon-optimized and successfully expressed in hek293t cells. the findings of this study confirmed that the recombinant s protein was highly immunogenic in cross serum neutralization (sn) between the s proteins of the two pedv subtypes and anti-s pabs. reciprocals of pedv neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the dilution inhibiting pedv infection by 50 %, which was calculated as follows: log50 % neutralizing titer = l-d (s-0.5), where l is the log of the lowest dilution factor, d is the difference between the dilution factors, and s is the sum of the ratios of positive wells variation between porcine epidemic diarrhea virus subtypes 545 mice and could effectively induce production of antibodies, especially neutralizing antibodies. furthermore, we found significant antigenic relationships between the pedv s protein of subtypes g1 and g2, which indicated that the cv777 vaccine could cross-protect against g2 epidemic strains, at least to some extent. however, the antigenic and serologic neutralization responses against the s protein also reflected antigenic differences of twofold between the two pedv subtypes, based on anti-s pabs titers. therefore, future development of vaccines against emerging pedv strains should involve multiple s proteins containing neutralizing epitopes from both the g1 and g2 subtypes.coronavirus (cov) is a class of genetically diverse rna viruses found in a wide range of hosts including reptiles, birds, and mammals. most pathogenic covs usually cause respiratory and intestinal symptoms in animals [1,2,3,4,5]. over the past 20 years, a few novel beta-coronaviruses originated from bats have been transmitted to humans and caused severe respiratory syndrome. sars-cov and mers-cov were first introduced to humans in 2002 and 2012, respectively [3]. recently, a new novel beta-coronavirus named sars-cov-2 first broke out in wuhan city, china. the first case of this virus was reported in december 2019 and this virus has subsequently spread explosively worldwide and severely threatened human health [3,6].cov is generally composed of four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (n), membrane (m), envelope (e), and spike glycoprotein (s). among these proteins, the s glycoprotein plays crucial roles in viral entry and pathogenesis as its widely exposed structure forms large petal-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion [7]. mutations in the spike glycoprotein can allow novel coronavirus strains to infect humans and spread pandemically [8]. therefore, s gene encoding s glycoprotein has widely been used for molecular analysis of coronaviruses due to the significant features of the s glycoprotein affecting the antigenicity and immunogenicity [2,4,9,10,11,12,13]. thus far, there has been little data comparing and analyzing s gene sequences within sars-cov-2. generally, several types of coronavirus are divided into subtypes depending on amino acid mutations in s gene sequences, and molecular analysis based on the s gene can provide insights into antigenicity, immunogenicity, or evolutionary trends [2,4,10,12,13]. thus, we analyzed the s gene sequences of sars-cov-2 to better understand this virus in this study. for phylogenetic analysis based on the s gene, 144 sequences of sars-cov-2 that globally originated from several countries (china, usa, italy, spain, japan, vietnam, taiwan, and pakistan) were retrieved from genbank. using iq-tree v1.6.12 [14], the genetic relationships between sars-cov-2 were inferred by the maximum likelihood (ml) method. the “-m mfp” option was invoked to help select the data best-fit amino acid substitution model. the branch support values were estimated by ultrafast bootstrap approximation [15] implemented in iq-tree [14] via the “-bb 1000” option. the reconstructed phylogenies were displayed and midpoint rooted by figtree v1.4.3. in the ml tree, completely divided clades were identified among the analyzed sars-cov-2 strains (figure 1a). interestingly, only one reliable synonymous change was found to distinguish between subtypes a and b in this study. sars-cov-2a and -2b strains consistently exhibited ala (d) and gly (g) at the amino acid sequence position 614, respectively (figure 1b). the virus consistently evolves to evade the host immune system with synonymous mutations that are so-called positive selection. more evolved viruses are better able to survive, thus such viruses will likely be dominant within the group [16]. sars-cov-2a includes the china strains confirmed in 2019, but sars-cov-2b only includes the usa strains confirmed after 2020. in addition, the usa was one of the latest countries to experience a covid-19 outbreak. although there was only a few months’ difference, sars-cov-2b may be a more evolved form. if the mutation of d614g plays a crucial role in the positive selection process, sars-cov-2b will be the dominant type of sars-cov-2 in the future. more long-term tracking will be required to validate this assumption.the s glycoprotein is important for viral entry and pathogenesis with the most variable sequences in the coronavirus genomes. human beta-coronavirus s proteins are cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits by host proteases [17]. the s1 subunit forming a globular shape is responsible for receptor binding [18] while the s2 subunit forming a rod shape mediates membrane fusion [19]. more specifically, the s1 subunit is composed of two major domains (s1-ntd and s1-ctd) and two sub-domains (sd-1 and sd-2). one or both of the major domains is potentially responsible for binding host-receptors, and the sub-domains that are complex folding of elements may allow receptor-induced conformational changes [11,20,21]. thus, mutations within the s1 region are associated with changes in antigenicity and viral pathogenicity [22]. in fact, the s1 subunit contains numerous major and minor neutralizing antibody epitopes [21,23]; thus, it is difficult to investigate all putative epitopes to discover which can play a crucial role on the antigenicity and immunogenicity of viruses. in this situation, inferences considering both aspects of virus evolution and epitope analysis can be helpful to investigate which epitopes really play a crucial role. b-cell epitopes on the s1 subunit were predicted by bepipred-2.0 [24], the chou & fasman method [25], the kolaskar and tongaonkar method [26] and parker’s hydrophilicity [27]. regions between amino acids 614 and 621 were equally identified as a b cell epitope by all four methods (figure 1c). the predicted b-cell epitope including amino acid 614 was located in a relatively well-exposed part of the s1 subunit in the 3d-view structure (figure 1d); this b-cell epitope sequence was identified within the sequence corresponding to the sd-1/-2 domain (figure 1e). the antigenic indexes of each amino acid in this region (amino acids 613–621) were calculated by the jameson–wolf method. when an antigen index was >0.5, it was believed to be a reliable position as an epitope [28]. the results of the antigenic index analysis showed severely reduced indexes of amino acids 615–617 in the sars-cov-2b strains compared to sars-cov-2a; it is predicted that the change of d614g affects the antigenicity of this region (figure 1f). since no amino acid changes were found in this area other than the change of d614g, it is believed that this amino acid change alters the conformation of these immunogenic determinants; consequently, this region is expected to no longer act as a b-cell epitope in sars-cov-2b. b-cell plays a major role in recognizing pathogens and stimulating adaptive immunity in the immune response against virus infection. thus, the elimination of b cell epitopes will likely reduce immunogenicity by hampering the immune cell recognition of the virus [29,30]. when reflecting the above results, sars-cov-2b may have reduced immunogenicity compared to sars-cov-2a. if so, it can permit persistent or recurrent infection of sars-cov-2b while evading immune cell recognition. in addition, the mutation of the s1 domain may induce different antigenicity and viral pathogenicity between the two subtypes. different virus subtypes will likely have somewhat different serological features depending on their antigenicity, although there may be some cross-reactivity. in addition, a certain subtype can serologically cover other serotypes [12,31]. thus, this point should be considered to create a new sars-cov-2 vaccine. indeed, if the two serotypes have different serological characteristics, a vaccine that includes both subtypes will be more effective at preventing covid-19, particularly when developing a killed vaccine that has a narrow protection range compared to a live vaccine. this study was confined to investigating the phylogenetic and genetic features of sars-cov-2 due to limited information. therefore, further study on the cross-reactivity between these two subtypes is required to validate our assumption. viruses have continually evolved through genetic mutations to evade host immune systems in the long history of the fight between humans and viruses. sars-cov-2, which has only recently been introduced in humans, will continue to evolve for survival in the current situation, in which this virus has already become a pandemic. to respond properly against this virus, continuous surveillance of this virus’ adaptation to evade host immune systems is important in the future. we propose an efficient framework for genetic subtyping of sars-cov-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the covid-19 pandemic. efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. however, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: sars-cov-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. we propose to identify mutational signatures of available sars-cov-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. these signatures, informative subtype markers (isms), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. through ism compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and orf1ab sites covarying with the d614g spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread. isms are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. by analyzing sequence data available in the gisaid database, we validate the utility of ism-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using isms to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in asia, europe, and the united states. in addition, we show the relationship of isms to phylogenetic reconstructions of sars-cov-2 evolution, and therefore, isms can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the nextstrain [1] project. the developed pipeline dynamically generates isms for newly added sars-cov-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on github at https://github.com/eesi/ism and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/. author summary the novel coronavirus responsible for covid-19, sars-cov-2, expanded to reportedly 8.7 million confirmed cases worldwide by june 21, 2020. the global sars-cov-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking viral transmission dynamics in real-time. through june 2020, researchers have obtained genetic sequences of sars-cov-2 from over 47,000 samples from infected individuals worldwide. since the virus readily mutates, each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individual’s exposure location and sample date. but, there are over 30,000 bases in the full sars-cov-2 genome—so tracking genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy. we describe a method to instead efficiently identify and label genetic variants, or “subtypes” of sars-cov-2. applying this method results in a compact, 11 base-long compressed label, called an informative subtype marker or “ism”. we define viral subtypes for each ism, and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic. major findings include (1) covarying nucleotides with the spike protein which has spread rapidly and (2) tracking emergence of a local subtype across the united states connected to asia and distinct from the outbreak in new york, which is found to be connected to europe.genetic grouping of sars-cov-2 coronavirus sequences using informative subtype markers for pandemic spread visualizationcryptosporidium parvum, a well-known protozoan intestinal parasite of the phylum apicomplexa, causes enteric diseases in domestic ruminants and humans. c. parvum is strongly associated with diarrhea in neonatal calves [1] . a report mentioned that the prevalence of this parasite reached 75% in pre-weaned calves in japan [2] . diarrhea is a complex and multifactorial disease symptom influenced by the nutritional and immunological status of a calf, the management of the herd, the environment, and various infectious agents [3] . co-infection with multiple pathogens may increase diarrhea severity and mortality rates. in addition to c. parvum, rotavirus, bovine coronavirus and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (e. coli k99) are well-known enteropathogens associated with neonatal diarrhea in calves throughout the world [4] [5] [6] . however, investigations to identify the multiple causative agents of diarrhea in calves have not been performed yet in japan. therefore, one of the aims of the present study was to determine the prevalence of the four major causative agents associated with clinical diarrheal cases in preweaned calves through use of commercial immunochromatography test (ict) strips.traditionally, c. parvum has been diagnosed by microscopy of fecal samples following sample concentration by the sugar floatation parasitology international 64 (2015) 161-166 method. however, c. parvum cannot be differentiated from c. bovis and c. ryanae using microscopy because their oocysts are of similar size and morphology [7] . c. bovis and c. ryanae have been detected exclusively from cattle, and infections with the two species are most likely asymptomatic [8] . it is therefore important to accurately distinguish those species from c. parvum. recently, the nucleotide sequences obtained from nested polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) of the small subunit ribosomal rna (ssurrna) and glycoprotein 60 (gp60) genes have been employed as tools for accurate species identification and subtyping analysis, respectively [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . although some epidemiological studies on c. parvum in japan have been performed using these dna markers [14] [15] [16] [17] , they did not characterize the c. parvum populations from more than one region of the country. therefore, the aim of the present study was not only to obtain epidemiological information about c. parvum based on ssurrna and gp60 gene sequences, but also to compare the characteristics of this parasite in two different japanese prefectures, southernmost okinawa and northernmost hokkaido.sampling location information is summarized in fig. 1 . we collected 50 diarrheic samples from calves aged from 6 to 88 days, from 29 farms located on three islands in okinawa prefecture, japan, from december 2012 to january 2013. one to seven samples were collected from each farm and the fecal properties of the samples were recorded. commercial ict strips (bio-x diagnostics sprl, jemelle, belgium) were used to detect c. parvum, rotavirus, coronavirus, and e. coli k99 antigens in the diarrhea samples (table 1) . twenty-five diarrheic samples were also collected from calves aged from 4 to 21 days in hokkaido prefecture, japan, from december 2012 to may 2013. one to five samples were collected from 11 farms ( table 2 ). these samples tested positive for c. parvum antigen using ict strips, and molecular characterizations were performed to compare those with c. parvum from okinawa prefecture. rotavirus, coronavirus, and e. coli k99 were not investigated for the samples from hokkaido prefecture. all the fecal samples were stored at 4°c and transported to laboratories for further analyses.the centrifugal sugar flotation method was used to detect cryptosporidium and other parasitic oocysts and/or eggs that might cause diarrhea. floatation was performed after suspending 1 g of a diarrheal sample in sucrose solution (1.2 g/ml), thereby allowing the approximate number of oocysts per gram (opg) to be calculated. the average number of oocysts for 10 fields at a magnification of 400 was calculated, and the average number was converted into opg by using the total number of fields under the microscope.opg values were compared between c. parvum single infections and mixed infections with rotavirus using a student's t-test. correlations between the fecal properties and the pathogens were evaluated for c. parvum-associated and non-associated diarrhea using fisher's exact test.total dna was extracted using a qiaamp® dna stool mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. before dna extraction, 0.2 g of each fecal sample was transferred to a 1.5 ml plastic tube and three cycles of freezing/thawing were performed; quick freezing was performed in a −80°c freezer for 15 min, while quick thawing was conducted in a 37°c water bath for 15 min. thereafter, ssurrna and gp60 genes were amplified by nested pcr. a previously described primer set [9] was used for nested pcr to amplify the ssurrna gene. for the gp60 gene, gp60 nested 1st f (5′-atg caa aaa tac gtg gac tgg gt-3′) and gp60 nested 1st r (5′-tcg cac gaa aga ttt cca ttg-3′) primers were used for the first round of [18] . in the phylogram construction, the gp60 sequences obtained in this study along with the c. parvum reference sequences were used. bootstrap analyses were conducted using 1000 replicates. for the 50 diarrheal samples from okinawa, 25 (50.0%) were c. parvum antigen-positive, 14 (28.0%) were rotavirus antigenpositive, one (2.3%) was coronavirus-positive, and two (4.7%) were e. coli k99 antigen-positive. eight samples were positive for both c. parvum and rotavirus, and one was positive for both c. parvum and coronavirus. the properties of the diarrheal samples are summarized in fig. 2 , and watery stools were significantly correlated (p b 0.05) with c. parvum infections (table 3) .among the samples from okinawa, the opg values ranged from 12 to 4.5 × 10 4 . cryptosporidium oocysts were not found in seven of the samples although they were positive for c. parvum antigen (ishigakijima island; table 1 ). no significant difference was observed in opg values between c. parvum single infections and mixed infections with rotavirus (fig. 3) . eimeria spp. oocysts were detected in three calves from okinawa (table 1) .ssurrna and gp60 genes were analyzed for accurate species identification and for subtyping analysis, respectively, and pcr amplicons were obtained from 29 and 20 samples in the both targeting regions ( table 2 ). the ssurrna gene was amplified in one sample from ishigakijima island, two samples from iriomotejima island, and one sample with no location data, even though all were negative for c. parvum antigen. in contrast, gp60 gene was not amplifiable from three ishigakijima island samples despite being positive for c. parvum antigen. surprisingly, we could not obtain a gp60 amplicon from one sample from kuroshima island and another sample with no location data, although both were c. parvum antigen-and oocyst-positive. however, the two dna target sequences were successfully amplified from the 25 samples from hokkaido ( table 2) .the nucleotide sequences of all the 786-bp ssurrna pcr amplicons from the two prefectures were identical to that of the c. parvum sequence deposited in genbank (accession no. ab746195). the nucleotide sequences of all the gp60 pcr amplicons (925bp) were also identical to each other, and shared 100% similarity values with the iiaa15g2r1 subtype sequence deposited in genbank (fig. 4) . nucleotide sequences representative of the ssurrna and gp60 genes have been deposited in genbank under accession nos. ab968045 to ab968048.this study is the first attempt in japan to detect the causative agents of diarrhea in pre-weaned calves using commercial ict strips. among the diarrhea samples from okinawa, the c. parvum antigen showed the highest frequency (50%). a previous study performed in hokkaido reported that the prevalence of c. parvum reached 75% in pre-weaned calves [2] . in contrast, the previously reported prevalence rates for rotavirus in japan were 9.6% [19] and 5.2% [20] . further investigations on diarrhea cases from different locations in japan may reveal the major pathogens involved in calf diarrhea more clearly. the present study revealed that the diarrhea cases associated with c. parvum tended to have watery diarrhea (table 3) . watery diarrhea causes severe dehydration in neonatal calves, which in turn may lead to a significant economic loss in cattle industry. our study did not reveal any significant difference in the opg values between single infections of c. parvum and mixed infections with another diarrhea-causing agent. however, the number of co-infections observed was insufficient to draw any conclusions about the effect that more than one pathogenic organism might have on the opg values. hence, continuous sampling from clinical cases of calf diarrhea is needed to obtain more accurate opg calculations to evaluate whether any correlations between c. parvum oocyst numbers and the presence or absence of other pathogens exist.in this study, the nested ssurrna gene appeared to be the more efficient of the two pcr tests at detecting c. parvum. the ssurrna gene was probably amplified efficiently because it is a multicopy gene whereas gp60 is a single locus gene [21] . the ict strip readily detected c. parvum antigen; however, our results suggest that there is a risk of misdiagnosis when this test strip alone is used to detect c. parvum. the gp60 nested pcr did not seem to always be effective at diagnosing c. parvum because we were unable to obtain amplicons from two of the okinawa samples, despite them being c. parvum antigen-and oocyst-positive according to microscopic observations. therefore, the results of this study suggest that it is better to use more than one method to reliably detect c. parvum.many c. parvum subtypes are categorized as the iia subtype family on the basis of their worldwide gp60 sequences [11, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . interestingly, the gp60 nucleotide sequences detected from the two different locations were identical to each other, and were classified as the iiaa15g2r1 subtype. furthermore, previous analyses of the gp60 subtype of c. parvum from gifu, kobe, hokkaido, and the most recent epidemiological study performed in the ishikari district of hokkaido also reported the occurrence of the iiaa15g2r1 subtype alone [14, 17, 37] . these findings suggest that c. parvum with the iiaa15g2r1 subtype is predominant in japan. because iiaa15g2r1 is a zoonotic subtype [10] , cryptosporidiosis control in japan is important for the health of domestic ruminants and humans alike.alphacoronavirus 1 (nidovirales: coronaviridae: coronavirinae: alphacoronavirus: tegacovirus) is a large enveloped virus species with a singlestranded positive-sense rna genome that is 29 kb in size (decaro et al., 2015) , and this virus can infect dogs, cats and pigs. the 5 0 2/3 of the genome encodes multiple replicase proteins important for replication, with two overlapping open read frames, orf 1a and 1ab, encoding 16 nonstructural proteins that generate the replicase complex (decaro et al., 2015; erles et al., 2007) .located downstream of orf1b are up to 11 orfs that encode the 4 structural proteins spike glycoprotein (s), membrane (m), envelope (e) and nucleocapsid (n) and a variable set of accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 3c, 7a and 7b) (decaro and buonavoglia, 2011) . alphacoronavirus 1 encompasses the host-type species canine coronavirus (ccov), feline coronavirus (fcov), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) and porcine respiratory virus (prcov) (decaro and buonavoglia, 2011; ntafis et al., 2013) .two genotypes of ccov are known, ccov-i and ccov-ii, with type ii divided into the subtypes ccov-iia (classical strains) and ccov-iib (tgev-like strains), with a putative recombination between ccov-ii and tgev strains (decaro et al., 2010 (decaro et al., , 2009 ). in addition, one unique subtype has emerged in the past decade and belongs to ccov-iia; this subtype is considered pantropic as it can cause enteric and systemic signs, reported in belgium, brazil, france, greece, hungary, ireland, italy, romania and the caribbean island of st. kitts (de barros et al., 2018; decaro et al., 2010; navarro et al., 2017; ntafis et al., 2013; pinto et al., 2014; soma et al., 2011; zicola et al., 2012) .similarly, two genotypes of fcov are also known: fcov-i and fcov-ii. type i ccov and fcov have been proposed to evolve from a common ancestral virus, while type ii ccov and fcov strains arose from multiple recombination events (regan et al., 2012) . fcov may be found as the mild enteric feline enteric coronavirus fcov and as the highly virulent feline peritonitis virus (fipv) (jaimes and whittaker, 2018) . this paper reports on the previously unknown molecular diversity of alphacoronavirus 1 in cats and dogs in colombia to provide phylogenetic information regarding this virus species in south america.a total of 43 fecal samples from puppies and young dogs under 1 year of age with hemorrhagic enteritis and from 5 cats between 75 days and 2 years with ascites or thoracic effusion were collected from 2014 to 2018 in a private veterinary practice in bogot a, colombia.the fecal samples were prepared as a 20% (v/v) suspension in depctreated water and clarified at 5,000âg for 15 min at 4 c. the effusions were used undiluted. dna was isolated from the fecal suspensions using guanidine-isothiocyanate (chomczynski, 1993) , and total rna was extracted from the fecal suspensions and effusions with trizol reagent™ (life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa).complementary dna (cdna) was prepared for all samples with random primers and m-mlv reverse transcriptase™ (life technologies, carlsbad, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used in pcr targeting pancoronavirus nsp12 (escutenaire et al., 2007) . all positive samples were submitted for the amplification of the partial m, n, s and 3b genes (de barros et al., 2018) .all samples were tested for canine protoparvovirus cpv-vp1 (demeter et al., 2009 ). gapdh was used as an internal control in both the rna and dna samples (2019leuteneger, 1999) . primers and amplicon sizes are shown in table 1 .amplicons for s, m, and n were purified with illustra exoprostar 1-step (ge healthcare, chalfont st. giles, uk) and sequenced bidirectionally using bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit™ (applied biosystems) and abi-3500 genetic analyzer™ (applied biosystems) following the manufacturer's instructions. positions with phred scores !20 were assembled with bioedit 7.0.5.3 (ibis biosciences, carlsbad, ca, usa), and the final sequences were aligned with homologous sequences from genbank (accession numbers in figures 1, 2 , 3, and 4) using clustal w in bioedit 7.0.5.3. the nucleotide alignments were used to build a maximum likelihood tree (tamura-nei model) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using mega 7 (kumar et al., 2016) , and crcov was used as a root for the trees because it is a betacoronavirus. recombination was assessed using rdp4 software (muhire et al., 2015) .twelve dog fecal samples and one cat effusion sample were positive for coronavirus after screening, while for carnivore protoparvovirus, 35 samples were positive, with 12 samples copositive (dogs) for coronavirus (a.1).regarding the m gene from the dog fecal samples, two subclusters were found for ccov type ii, one with the mh795525, mh717720 and mh795523 samples (bootstrap 83) and the other with the mh717721 and mh795527 samples (bootstrap 99), while the samples mh717724, mh717722 and mh717719 segregated in a more dispersed pattern within the colombian cluster (identities ranging from 99.4 to 95.1%, figure 1 ). the ccov strains mh795526 and mh795524, however, were classified as ccov i (identities ranging from 86.9 to 87.8%, figure 1 ) in a subcluster containing only colombian strains. finally, the feline sample mh717723 from a cat with ascites was categorized into the fcov type ii cluster (identity ¼ 92.1% with nc002306.3) (figure 1) .for the n gene, one sample from a dog resulted in a sequence typed as the ccov-i h717716 sample, which clustered closely to ccov-i strains detected in brazil in 2009 (kp322089.1) and in italy in 2003 (ay548235.1), while three sequences were found to be related to ccov-ii mh717718 and mh717717 in one subcluster and mh795528 in a second subcluster (identities ranging from 90.1 to 91.7%, figure 2) , each of which was distinct from the pantropic ccov type (dq112226.1).for the s gene, two primer sets (subtype i and iib) were used, resulting in the identification of one sequence related to ccov-i mh603132 (identity 0.962), which segregated into a cluster containing strains from brazil from 2012 ( figure 3) ; three additional colombian strains were classified as ccov-ii mh795529, mh708884, and mh603133 (identities ranging from 92 to 93.8%) in a cluster containing only colombian strains that was distinct from pantropic ccov-iia ( figure 4 ).all sequences generated in this study were submitted to genbank under the accession numbers mh717719-24 and mh795523-27 (11 for the m gene), mh717716-18 and mh795528 (4 for the n gene) and mh603132-33, mh708884 and mh795529 (4 for the s gene). although no recombination events were found, notably, the vaccine strain d13096 insavc-1 was located in the ccov-i type cluster when classified by the n gene; however, when based on the spike protein, this strain was located in the ccov-ii cluster (figures 1, 3, and 4) .alphacoronavirus 1 is a major viral agent that causes gastrointestinal symptoms in dogs and cats. the detection frequency of ccov in ill puppies in this study was low (27%) compared with that in other studies, with 65.1% of the samples positive for ccov (ntafis et al., 2013) ; some studies have shown low positive results of 4.8% (navarro et al., 2017) for single infections, while other studies reported a prevalence of 20.3% for ccov (alves et al., 2018) and 18% for cpv in dogs (wang et al., 2016) . infections with more than one virus are infrequent, and different studies have shown that the coinfection percentage varies between 20% (soma et al., 2011) and 40% (costa et al., 2014) . both ccov-i and ccov-iib have been found in dog fecal samples, and fcov-ii was found in an ascitic cat in colombia in this study, showing that these types of alphacoronavirus 1 are present and play a role in canine enteritis and feline infectious peritonitis in this country. as no previous reports on either the prevalence or sequences of these viruses in colombia are available and due to limited sampling, a more conclusive evolutionary relationship cannot be drawn from the results, but as shown in the trees, colombian ccov strains are closely related to the brazilian strains described by de barros et al., 2018 based on the m, n, and si genes evaluated in this study; however, these genes typically clustered into subclusters harboring the colombian strains. notably, subtypes iia and iib have been associated with fatal enteritis in puppies in the usa (licitra et al., 2014) .recombination in alphacoronavirus 1 is a well-documented phenomenon, resulting mainly from copy choice related to the trs motif (decaro et al., 2010 (decaro et al., , 2009 ntafis et al., 2013; p erez et al., 2014; terada et al., 2014) ; however, no recombination events were found among the colombian alphacoronavirus 1 strains in this study, possibly due to the limited number of sequences analyzed; thus, further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenicity of alphacoronavirus in colombia.nonetheless, the vaccine strain insavc-1 (d13096), a ccov-iia strain based on the spike protein (decaro et al., 2013 (decaro et al., , 2007 , was found herein in the ccov-i cluster when classified by the n gene, suggesting intergenic homologous recombination (terada et al., 2014) . 1 introduction percent of acute respiratory infections are viral ones (nitsch-osuch et al. 2015) . the multiplex rt-pcr method is a highly sensitive alternative to other diagnostic procedures (templeton et al. 2004 ). it saves time and reagents necessary to test samples for the presence of genetic material of respiratory viruses, which also expedites the introduction of proper treatment (stefańska et al. 2012) . the methods enables to detect several co-infecting contagions during a single test. the most common respiratory viruses are influenza virus type a and b, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, 3, and human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and human coronavirus (do et al. 2011) .influenza is a disease which, due to its constant evolution, causes persistent epidemics and less frequently pandemics (brydak 2014) . co-infections with influenza viruses may induce re-assortment between the viruses, leading to a more pathogenic subtype (liu et al. 2010) . in particular, co-infections with different subtypes of influenza a virus constitute a likely source of reassortants that can acquire unpredictable properties (pajak et al. 2011) . a sectional structure of the influenza virus genome brings about the variation of genotype and phenotype of the virus. when the host cell is infected with more than one strain, viruses equipped with a new set of genes may appear. considering the essential role of co-infections in spread and severity of the disease, the goal of this study was to determine the frequency and a crisscross pattern of co-infections with influenza and influenza-like viruses.the study protocol was approved by an institutional ethics committee. in total, during the influenza season 2015/2016 in poland 8542 samples from patients of all ages were tested. swabs from the nose and throat and the washings from the bronchial tree (balf) were taken. the tests were performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr. the analysis was carried out in the roche light cycler 2.0 system. the qrt-pcr reactions were performed in capillary tubes of 20 μl volume with 0.5 μm primers and 0.2 μm probe for each reaction. the probes and primers were obtained from the influenza reagent resources (irr) program operated by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc 2016 a/switzerland/9715293/2013 (h3n2), b/phuket/3073/2013, and a negative control was provided by rnase-free water. before the start of amplification, viral rna was rewritten to cdna, using the reverse transcriptase enzyme at 50 c for 30 min. then, samples were analyzed according to the following scheme: initialization at 95 c for 2 min and 45 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 c for 15 s, annealing at 55 c for 30 s, and extension at 72 c for 2 min.conventional multiplex rt-pcr in the influenza season 2015/2016 73,co-infections with influenza viruses were reported, as shown in table 1 .the following types of co-infections were confirmed: subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 with subtype a/h1n1/ (4 cases), subtype a/h1n1/ pdm09 and subtype a/h3n2/ (2 cases), subtype a/h1n1/ and influenza virus b type (1 case), subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 and influenza type b (15 cases), and co-infection of unsubtyped type a with type b virus (51 cases).co-infections were reported in people of all ages, from month 1 to 90 years of age. most co-infections caused by influenza viruses were reported among children up to 4 years of age (22 cases), in the other age-groups the number of co-infections was lower: 5-9 years -18 cases, 10-14 years -5 cases, 15-25 years -3 cases, in the epidemic season 2015/2016 co-infections between influenza viruses and influenza-like viruses and among influenza-like viruses were noted, as shown in table 2 . seventeen cases co-infections with influenza and influenza-like viruses were recorded. the following types of co-infections were confirmed: subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 and rsv (5 cases), a/h1n1/pdm09 and rsv and rv a/b (3 cases), a/h1n1/pdm09 with influenza type b virus and rsv (1 case), a/h1n1/pdm09 and hcov oc43 (2 cases), a/h1n1/pdm09 and influenza type b virus and hcov oc43 (1 case), a/h1n1/pdm09 and influenza type b virus, hmpv and rsv (1 case), influenza virus type a and rsv (2 cases), influenza virus type a and hcov oc43 (1 case), and influenza virus type a with rv a/b (1 case). furthermore, six co-infections of influenza-like viruses were confirmed: rsv and hcov 229/nl63 (2 cases), rsv and rva/b (1 case), rsv and piv-1 (1 case), adv and hcov 229/nl63 (1 case), hcov 229/nl63, and rsv and piv-2 (1 case) ( table 2) . concerning the regional distribution of co-infections, most of those caused by another influenza virus were observed in the provinces of mazovia (39 cases) and lesser-poland (25 cases), co-infections with more than one influenza virus were noted in sub-carpathian (3 cases), lower-silesia (2 cases), and single cases in kuyavian-pomeranian, silesia, and lublin provinces (table 3) .co-infections of subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 with a/h1n1/, subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 with a/h3n2/, and a/h1n1/ with influenza b virus were confirmed only in the province of mazovia (4, 2, 1 cases, respectively). co-infections of subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 with influenza b virus were reported in mazovia (8 cases), sub-carpathian, lesser-poland (in 2 cases), lower-silesia, kuyavian-pomeranian, and lublin provinces (1 case each). the most frequently confirmed co-infection was a combination of infection with influenza virus type a and b, with the most cases reported in mazovia (25) and lesser-poland province (23). moreover, in sub-carpathian, silesia and lower-silesia provinces one case was confirmed per each region (table 3) .the 2015/2016 epidemic season was dominated by co-infections of unsubtyped influenza a and b virus (51 cases), reported among people from 1 to 84 years of age. there were also 15 cases of subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 and influenza virus type b co-infections. moreover, there were detected single cases of co-infections of subtype a/h1n1/ with influenza virus type b (65 years of age) and of subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 with a/h3n2/ (63 and 5 years of age). there also were four confirmed cases of co-infections between subtypes a/h1n1/pdm09 and a/h1n1/ among children up to 4 years of age and adults above 46 years of age. co-infections of influenza viruses with influenza-like viruses and co-infections among influenza-like viruses were reported only in children up to 11 years of age. here, the following co-infection were detected: subtype a/h1n1/ pdm09 with influenza type b virus, hmpv, and rsv (1.5 years of age). there were also four cases of co-infections with three respiratory viruses: three cases of co-infections with subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 and rsv and rv a/b, and one case of co-infection with subtype a/h1n1/ pdm09, influenza type b virus and hcov oc43 (table 2 ).in the 2015/2016 epidemic season, there was a higher number of confirmed co-infections with influenza and respiratory influenza-like viruses, compared with previous seasons. in the 2012/ 2013 season, co-infections were as follows: ten of subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 with a/h3n2/ and 8 of a/h3n2/ with type b virus (czarkowski et al. 2014) . in the 2013/2014 season, co-infections were as follows: two of subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 with a/h3n2/, seven of influenza with influenza-like viruses (two of influenza type a virus, rsv a virus, and rv a/b virus in one-day old and one-month-old children each), and three of influenza-like viruses (bednarska et al. 2015) . in the 2014/2015 season, in a framework of the i-move (influenza monitoring of vaccine effectiveness) program, the following co-infections were detected: seven of subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 with type b virus and eight of subtype a/h3n2/ with type b virus. in that last season, in addition, one co-infection of influenza viruses and four of influenza viruses with influenza-like viruses were noted in children under 14 years of age . a significant increase in the number of infections with more than one respiratory virus in the 2015/2016 season could be associated with a higher number of samples tested (8542 samples) compared with the two preceding seasons (2479 and 2416 samples, respectively) bednarska et al. 2015) . nonetheless, influenza viruses constantly evolve, undergoing antigenic changes, which provides them the ability to elude the host immune response system (webster et al. 2013 ).respiratory infections are one of the most common reasons for hospital admission [1, 2] . identification of the causative agent is often omitted or limited to a few pathogens easily detectable by direct antigen tests [2] . however, the reliable diagnosis of respiratory infection is important for therapy [3] , implementation of isolation measures [4] , and better use of antimicrobial therapy [5] . epidemiological data from the laboratory can be used for prescribing prophylactic treatments for at risk patients [6, 7] , or for alerting to new or seasonal spread of pathogens [2] .direct fluorescent antibody testing and viral culture are time consuming and demand significant expertise in the performance of the test and interpretation of test results. on the other hand, rapid antigen testing appeared to lack sensitivity in the detection of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), with reported sensitivities as low as 21% and 59% respectively [8] [9] [10] . nucleic acid detection tests for respiratory virus assays have gained popularity due to their quick turnaround-time and propensity for multiplexing and automation.the fda cleared four molecular multiplex respiratory panels, namely the filmarray rp (respiratory panel) (biofire diagnostics, salt lake city, ut), the esensor rvp (respiratory viral panel) (genmark dx, carlsbad, ca), the luminex xtag rvpv1, and the luminex xtag rvp fast (luminex molecular diagnostics, austin, tx). these platforms are able to detect 12-20 targets simultaneously, at reported sensitivities and specificities of 78.8%-95.4%, and > 99.0% respectively [3] .the filmarray rp (fa-rp) is the most automated, requiring no preextraction and additionally tests for three bacterial agents not detected https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.07.002 received 12 january 2018; received in revised form 18 may 2018; accepted 5 july 2018 by the other three platforms, namely bordetella pertussis, chlamydophila pneumoniae, and mycoplasma pneumoniae. the fa-rp is a melt curvebased real-time pcr (rt-pcr) method, whereby the amplification occurs in two steps: the 1 st step is to enrich for the target nucleic acids in the sample in a multiplex reaction and the 2nd step is to amplify each target in multiple miniaturized individual wells containing single specific primer-pairs. the nucleic acid extraction, distribution of nucleic acid into wells and pcr amplification are fully automated and integrated and occur in a single-use pouch.the anyplexii rv16 (seegene, south korea) is an alternative to fda-approved integrated platforms. it requires pre-extraction and prereverse transcription, but runs on common rt-pcr platforms such as cfx-96 (bio-rad, hercules, ca) and ab7500 (thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma). it utilizes proprietary toce ™ technologies to achieve simultaneous detection of melt curves from 16 viral targets in two-tube reactions.the argene real-time pcr assay-respiratory range (biomerieux, france) is compatible with major extraction platforms and real-time pcr systems as well as on various sample types. the argene pcr kits have been validated to exhibit good analytical sensitivity and specificity, thus represent a rapid and reliable test for the detection of viruses and bacteria causing respiratory infections. the turn-around time for the assays, not including extraction, is within 2 h.the objective of this study was to compare the clinical performance (using actual clinical respiratory samples) of the two multiplexing strategies represented by the fa-rp (version 1.7) and anyplexii rv16 (version 1.1), with that from a more conventional, two-plex rt-pcr kit represented by respiratory virus assays from the argene (biomerieux, france) range.the research study protocol was submitted to the singhealth centralised institutional review board (cirb ref no.: 2015/2930) and was exempted from review based on the nature of the study.a total of 224 specimens, which comprised 189 nasopharyngeal swab specimens in universal transport medium (utm, copan, italy), and 35 endotracheal aspirate (ett) specimens were collected from symptomatic patients from august 2015 to march 2016. the first 107 study specimens were collected prospectively in sequential order, and the remaining 117 specimens comprised fa-rp positive universal transport medium (utm) specimens and respiratory aspirates (positive and negative specimens). the distribution of microorganisms detected in the samples used for this study is shown in supplemental table 1 .the fa-rp, anyplexii rv16, and argene assays (comprising adenovirus/bocavirus, coronavirus/piv, influenza a/influenzab, rsv/ mpv, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) were highly similar in their targets. bocavirus and the fa-rp bacterial targets (b. pertussis, c. pneumoniae, and m. pneumoniae) were not compared, as bocavirus was not covered in fa-rp, and the bacterial agents were not covered in anyplexii rv16 and argene. coronavirus (nl63, oc43, khu1, 229e) and parainfluenza (piv1, piv2, piv3, piv4) can be detected by argene kit but cannot be subtyped and were reported as groups. fa-rp can detect and subtype four coronavirus subtypes (229e, hku1, oc43, and nl63) while anyplexii rv16 covered and subtype three (229e, oc43, and nl63).influenza a was not subtyped by anyplexii rv16 and argene. rhinovirus/enterovirus and rsv were reported as groups by both fa-rp and argene. in contrast, anyplexii rv16 distinguished between rhinovirus and enterovirus, and could subtype rsv into rsv a and rsv b.quality control, assay validation and result interpretation were performed according to individual manufacturer's instructions. for anyplexii rv16 and argene, microbial nucleic acids were extracted using the ez1 virus mini kit (qiagen, singapore) on ez1 or ez1xl (qiagen, singapore) automated sample preparation platforms (sample extraction volume: 400 μl, elution volume: 150 μl). the fa performs extraction and nucleic acid amplification on the same platform. utm samples were used directly for fa-rp or for ez1/ez1xl extraction. other respiratory aspirates underwent pre-processing using a "dunk and swirl" method in utm [11] prior to nucleic acid extraction. briefly, the sputum samples were diluted and mixed with an equal volume of sterile water, a sterile swab was then dunked into each sample, withdrawn and then swirled in 700 μl of sterile water. the swab was removed and solution used for testing. anyplexii rv16 and argene rt-pcr runs were carried out using cfx-96 (bio-rad) and rotorgene (qiagen), respectively.the fa-rp automatically interpreted and showed the results for each target (detected/ not detected/ invalid). for fa-rp, influenza a results which were "equivocal" or "no subtype", the specimens were further tested by an in-house influenza a/b multiplex qpcr assay which can detect prevalent influenza a virus (all subtypes), influenza a virus h1n1pdm09 subtype and influenza b virus. samples which were "equivocal" or "no subtype" by fa-rp were confirmed by argene or anyplexii as true positives but with a low viral load. the in-house pcr assay was used as an extended reference test for fa-rp for "equivocal" or "no subtype" samples. for argene assays, a cycle threshold of < 40 denotes the presence of the target organism in the sample according to manufacturer's instructions. for anyplexii rv16 assay, melting curve was called for positive or negative results according to kit instruction. for all three platforms, only results from valid runs were used for calculations in this comparison study.an approach of extended (composite) reference was used for the interpretation of results: that is, a true positive was defined as being positive by two or more of the three platforms compared.to facilitate comparison, for cases where targets were reported as a group, identification to correct group would be considered as a concordant case when compared with another assay that may provide more a specific identification. for example, detection of influenza a by anyplexii rv16 and argene, and the detection of influenza a/h1-2009 by filmarray for the same specimen would be considered as a concordant result. results from multiple-positive samples were grouped into respective targets for sensitivity and specificity calculations.the performance of fa-rp method on different sample types (utm vs ett) in terms of sensitivity and specificity was evaluated. this was accomplished by comparing the results obtained using fa-rp against those from the composite gold standard between the two sample types. a concordance in results between fa-rp and composite gold standard (i.e. both positive and both negative) was considered a match. twotailed fisher's exact test was used to assess for any significant difference in the correct diagnosis using fa-rp method (with composite gold standard as reference) between the two sample types. a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.the first 107 specimens were prospectively collected in sequential order, reflecting the actual clinical distribution of samples sent to the laboratory. 38 specimens (36.5%) were positive by fa-rp. the most common viruses detected were human rhinovirus/enterovirus (12.5%), influenza a & b (8.7%), and rsv (7.7%). there were 2 samples detected with dual-infection (1.87%).subsequent to the first 107 specimens, the samples were collected selectively, with the purpose of selection of additional positive targets for comparative testing. as such, the final collection comprised 60.7% (136) positive samples, representing all targets covered by fa-rp except influenza (h1). only one positive specimen was collected for coronavirus 229e, parainfluenza virus 4 (piv4). all other targets were represented by 3-20 samples (supplemental table 1 ). there were 11 specimens which were positive for 2 targets, and a single specimen positive for 3 targets. there were 28 influenza specimens in this study covering all categories of influenza a results except the "h1 subtype" category.the overall performance of all three platforms was comparable, with sensitivities and specificities ranging from 95.8% to 97.9%, and from 96.1% to 98.0%, respectively. the discordant rates for fa-rp, argene, and anyplexii rv16 were also similar (5.1%, 5.8%, and 5.1% respectively). discordant cases were randomized across the targets, with no prominent shortcoming specifically associated with any of the platforms tested (table 1) .among the three platforms, argene had the most false-negatives and was associated with the lowest sensitivity but the highest specificity, while the fa-rp was associated with the highest sensitivity but lowest specificity ( table 1 ). the differences were not statistically different at p < 0.05. the specificities for the individual assays were ≥99.0% for all the three platforms (table 1) . for fa-rp, the lowest sensitivity was for detection of adenovirus (92.3%). for argene, the lowest sensitivity was for detection of rhino/enterovirus and rsv (both 88.9%). any-plexii rv16 had the lowest sensitivity (92.0%) for influenza a.there were two dual-positive samples in the sequentially collected samples (1.9%), and 11 (10.3%) dual-positive samples in the entire test panel. one discordant case was observed (cov and rsv by fa-rp, cov by argene and anyplexii rv16), suggesting that dual positive samples can be diagnosed accurately using fa-rp, argene and anyplexii rv16.there were 7 specimens that represented influenza a "no sub-type" or "equivocal" results, as reported by fa-rp. these samples were tested using the comparator platforms, and further compared with an in-house qpcr test which tested for the presence of influenza a/h1-2009/ influenza b. all three "no sub-type" samples were influenza a positive by argene (ct-values of 26-31), anyplexii rv16, and in-house tests (ctvalues of 28-33). the ct-values for argene and in-house test were comparable. all four "equivocal" samples were influenza a positive by argene, but in-house test and anyplexii rv16 were negative for two of the samples. these two influenza a equivocal samples were considered to be positive by fa-rp. all the "equivocal" samples had ct-values of > 30. this suggests that "equivocal" samples may be weak positive samples and that "no-subtype" samples may also be moderate-to-weak table 1 summary of discordant cases in this study. fn, false-negative; fp, false-positive. for the sake of simplicity, entries which represent "0″ or "100%" are replaced by "." instead. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] positive samples.among the utm samples, 124 out of 126 samples which were tested positive by fa-rp turned out to be positive on composite gold standard. 62 out of 63 samples which were tested negative by fa-rp turned out to be negative on composite gold standard. hence according to the definition, there were three discordant results-two false positives and one false negative for utm samples. this translated to 99.2% sensitivity and 96.9% specificity of the fa-rp method using utm samples.among the ett samples, 9 out 10 samples which were tested positive by fa-rp turned out to be positive on composite gold standard. 24 out of 25 samples which were tested negative by fa-rp turned out to be negative on composite gold standard. hence, there were two discordant results-one false positive and one false negative for ett samples. this translated to 90% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity of the fa-rp method using ett samples.the statistical analysis showed that 98.4% of utm versus 94.3% of ett samples were correctly classified. the percentage difference of 4.1% was not statistically significant (p = 0.175, fisher's exact test).a wide range of diagnostic kits for respiratory pathogens have emerged, addressing both american (fda-approved) and european (ce-ivd) markets. these kits vary widely in terms of extensiveness of target coverage, throughput, and degree of automation. among non-fda approved platforms, the respifinder (pathofinder), seeplex rv15 (seegene), magicplex rv panel (seegene), clart pneumovir (genomica), and resplex ii panel (qiagen) have been compared extensively, with reported sensitivities ranging from as low as 56.2% to 91.6%, albeit with excellent specificities (> 94%) for all pathogens [2] . among the fda-approved platforms, the performance of the fa-rp, luminex xtag rvp, luminex xtag rvp fast, and esensor rvp have been investigated [3] . sensitivities ranged from 84.4% (luminex xtag rvp fast) to 98.3% (esensor rvp), while specificities were high for all assays (> 99%) [3] . fa-rp had an overall sensitivity of 84.5%, with substantially lower sensitivity noted for detection of adenovirus [3] .there are comparatively fewer evaluations of anyplexii rv16, but in a comparative study in 2013, the assay was reported to have an overall sensitivity of 95.2% [12] .in this comparative study, the fa-rp, anyplexii rv16 and argene assays were noted to have comparable sensitivities and specificities of 97.9% and 96.1%; 97.2% and 97.1%, and 95.8% and 98.0%, respectively. in a comparison study between anyplexii rv16, seeplex rv15 (seegene), and xtag rvp, the overall sensitivity of rv16 was better than that of xtag rvp [12] . however, improvement of the sensitivity for rhinovirus was required [12] . in this study, fa-rp and anyplexii rv16 had the same sensitivity (96.2%) for rhinovirus/enterovirus, better than that for argene (92.6%). hence, the lack of sensitivity towards rhinovirus previously reported was not observed in this study. the sensitivity of fa-rp to adenovirus had been a concern because the original version (v1.6) of this kit was not able to detect several adv serotypes [13] . in the modified version (v1.7), the sensitivity improved from 66.6% to 90.5% in retrospective studies, and 42.7% to 83.3% in prospective studies [13] . however, there was still one serotype (serotype 31) that remained undetected in v1.7 and the performance for adenovirus testing was still lower when compared to an in-house assay [14] . in this study, the sensitivity of fa-rp (v1.7) for adv was 92.3%, comparable to that reported earlier [13] .respiratory aspirates are of specific interest for the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. however, the fa-rp is fda-cleared only for testing on nasopharyngeal swab specimens transported in utm. in contrast, respiratory aspirates were considered acceptable samples for argene and anyplexii rv16, both of which are ce-ivd.two previous studies evaluating the fa-rp on a large number of bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) specimens supported the utility of respiratory aspirates for fa-rp [15, 16] . in this study, there was no final run-qc failure associated with the use of respiratory aspirates on the fa-rp. furthermore, there was no significant difference in the percentage of matches (comparing fa-rp with composite gold standard) between utm and ett sample types. hence, this and earlier studies suggest that respiratory aspirates are acceptable sample types for fa-rp.there were 7-8 samples for adv, influenza b, and rsv. all other targets were represented by sample sizes ranging from 10-21. although more samples for adv, influenza b and rsv are desired, collection period will be prolonged. similarly, more influenza a "equivocal" and "no-subtype" samples will be desirable. similarly, most of the respiratory aspirates were ett, while sputum and bal were poorly represented or not represented at all. there were only one each of piv4, coronavirus 229e, and 3-targets positive samples. hence, these categories were not well represented. another shortcoming was the use of "positive by at least two platforms" as the reference result for calculating sensitivity and specificity. hence, an assay with greater sensitivity than all other assays tested would result in reduced specificity. finally, all the platforms compared herein were multiplexed assays. the argene duplex-assays were the closest to conventional qpcr assays. ideally, each target should be compared with individual qpcr assays, but this was not practical due to the lack of laboratory developed tests (ldts) for every target, as well as financial constraints.one shortcoming of the filmarray is that despite its short turnaround time (1 h), only one sample could be processed per run, while most platforms have higher sample throughput (up to 96 samples) despite a longer turnaround time (5.5 h for xtag, 2.75 h for xtag fast, 0.92 h for esensor, and 7 h for anyplexii rv16) [3, 12] . anyplexii and argene are thus of higher throughput and geared towards batched testing, while the low complexity filmarray is more suited for on-demand analysis and requires minimum hands-on time. since the fil-marray performed comparably to anyplexii, the laboratory's required turnover and workflow considerations would be major determinants in the selection of a platform for screening respiratory agents. it should also be noted that the filmarray also had the highest reagent costs among these automated platforms [3] .it is worth noting that the three chosen technologies employed in this study were designed for very different laboratory purposes. the biofire system is, regarding its workflow, clearly suitable for emergency or point of care testing with an excellent time to result. the seegene anyplexii (or the alternative allplex in one-step rt-pcr) fits well with routine activity involving batched samples for testing on a daily basis. the argene solution offers quite similar features with the added advantage that the test panel may be adapted with a focus on particular organisms such as influenzae or rsv during the epidemic period depending on the ongoing epidemiology of respiratory infections.we have demonstrated the comparable clinical performance of three commercial kits for respiratory viral detection, namely: filmarray respiratory panel (rp), anyplexii rv16, and argene using archived clinical respiratory samples, based on common overlapping targets across the platforms. a more extensive study with larger sample size representative of the different viral categories is required to evaluate the platforms' performance at higher resolution.the authors declare no conflict of interest.(nmrc/cg/002/2013 -cg12aug02-15).supplementary material related to this article can be found, in the online version, at doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.07.002.in april 2009, outbreaks of influenza-like illnesses caused by a novel influenza a virus, pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 (also referred to as "swine-origin influenza virus, s-oiv"), were identified in mexico and the united states (centers for disease control and prevention, 2009; dawood et al., 2009 ). these outbreaks have led to a global influenza pandemic (brownstein et al., 2009) . recent surveillance data show that the pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 is co-circulating with seasonal influenza viruses in many countries (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/pdf/external f0939.pdf; http://www.who.int/csr/don/2009 10 23/en/index.html). because pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 and seasonal influenza transmit in a similar manner and present almost identical symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/qa.htm), the control and prevention of this novel pandemic has been challenging. critical for viral containment, surveillance, and treatment is the development of sensitive, accurate, and reliable diagnostic tests that can discriminate the h1n1 influenza virus from other strains.among the current laboratory diagnostic tests, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr), which determines virus copies by monitoring the fluorescence accumulations, has many advantages over other detection techniques. these include: ease of performance, great accuracy, high sensitivity and specificity, fast turn-around time, a high-throughput capacity, and minimal carry-over contamination (mackay et al., 2002) . however, rrt-pcr assays for subtyping seasonal influenza viruses (daum et al., 2007) have not been suitable for the detection of pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 because of genetic variations.several rrt-pcr assays have been developed recently to detect the pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 (carr et al., 2009; hall et al., 2009; jiang et al., 2010; pabbaraju et al., 2009; wang et al., 2009; whiley et al., 2009 ). however, these assays are not able to type and subtype seasonal influenza viruses simultaneously. another limitation of these rrt-pcr assays is that they only target the novel h1 gene of the pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 virus (jiang et al., 0166-0934/$ -see front matter © 2010 elsevier b.v. all

primer-or probe-targeted genes. in addition, there has been a report of some cross-reactivity between the pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 virus and the influenza a virus h5n1 when using the us cdc's rrt-pcr assay, which is recommended by the world health organization (who) . the development of an rrt-pcr assay with improved sensitivity, specificity, and performance, as well as the ability to distinguish pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 from seasonal influenza viruses would be most useful.a taqman probe-based, multiplex rrt-pcr assay is described that can detect all currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses, including the pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 virus. the assay can type simultaneously influenza viruses a and b, and the major human subtypes: human h1, h3, n1 and n2. this rrt-pcr protocol could aid in the surveillance, diagnosis, and management of the pandemic a/h1n1 2009 influenza and seasonal influenzas.the primers and taqman probes for the pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 named n1-2009 and for the consensus influenza a virus named flu a m were synthesised as previously described (whiley et al., 2009 ) and based on the who's recommendations (http://www.euro.who.int/document/inf/cdc realtime rtpcr h1n1.pdf). other primers and probes for the pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 virus and for seasonal influenza viruses such as human h1n1 and h3n2 were designed based on the sequence data obtained from the influenza virus resource (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/flu/) ( table 1) . primers/probes for typing of the viral strains were designed to target the conserved regions of the m gene segment for the influenza a virus and of the np gene segment for the influenza b virus. primers/probes for subtyping of viral strains were designed to target the ha gene segment for each of the three ha subtypes (h1-consensus, h1-pandemic a/h1n1 2009 and h3) and the na gene segment for each of the three na subtypes (n1consensus, n1-pandemic a/h1n1 2009 and n2). in silico coverage of primers/probes was calculated using an in-house program based on work described previously (bose et al., 2009) , with some modifications. briefly, a sequence was defined as a "hit" if there were two or less substitutions within the probe, or if there were no substitutions within five bases from the 3 end; one or less substitutions within 10 bases from the 3 end; or three or less substitutions within the primers. for degenerate primers or probes, an acceptable "hit" was defined by the presence of an accurate match between the sequence data consensus (made by bioedit 7.01 software) and its primers or probes.all primers/probes were grouped into four sets based on the pcr product size, fluorochrome-labels, and the pilot tests (table 1 ). the four sets were designed for the detection of different subtypes: set 1 for h1 of pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 and for the consensus h1 of influenza a viruses; set 2 for n1 of pandemic influenza nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from peking union medical college hospital and from beijing children's hospital between january 2007 and december 2008. samples were preliminarily screened for influenza viruses and other respiratory viruses using pcr assays, as described elsewhere (ren et al., 2009 ). among the 119 randomly selected samples, 105 samples tested positive for influenza a virus, two positive for influenza b virus, two positive for coronavirus oc43, two positive for adenovirus, and eight negative for all known respiratory viruses.in addition to these samples, 32 nasopharyngeal swab specimens that were positive for pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 were collected by the beijing cdc between may and july 2009. these latter samples were screened using the us cdc's realtime rt-pcr protocol for pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 as recommended by who (http://www.euro.who.int/document/ inf/cdc realtime rtpcr h1n1.pdf).to extract viral nucleic acids, 200 l of each nasopharyngeal swab, clinical sample or viral culture were added into 2 ml of lysis buffer and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. after lysis, the samples were loaded onto the nuclisens ® easymag tm (biomérieux, marcy l'etoile, france) for total nucleic acid extraction according to the manufacturer's protocol. the viral nucleic acids were stored at −80 • c prior to detection.one-step reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) was performed and optimised using superscript tm iii one-step rt-pcr system with platinum ® taq dna polymerase (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, 2 l of nucleic acid solution was added to 23 l of master mix containing the following components at the indicated final concentrations: 1× reaction buffer, 1 l of superscript tm iii rt/platinum ® taq mix, 500 nm of each primer, and 300 nm of the probe labelled at the 5 end with a reporter dye and at the 3 end with a non-fluorescent quencher based on the four sets of multiplex rrt-pcr assays (table 1) . thermocycling was carried out as follows: 30 min at 50 • c and 3 min at 95 • c for reverse transcription (rt) and denaturation; five pre-cycles at 95 • c for 15 s, at 50 • c for 30 s, and at 72 • c for 1 min; followed by 40 cycles at 95 • c for 10 s, and at 55 • c for 40 s. the multiplex rrt-pcr assay was performed on a cfx 96 (bio-rad laboratories inc., hercules, ca). the baseline fluorescence threshold for each analysis was manually adjusted based on the background fluorescence of the 'no template' control reaction using the baseline subtracted curve fit analysis mode in bio-rad cfx manager software. for each analysis, a sample amplification curve exceeding baseline fluorescence with a corresponding c t (cycle threshold) value (not exceeding 36 in a 40-cycle run) was considered as positive. in addition, a c t value between 36 and 40 was considered as weakly positive. an amplification curve lower than the baseline fluorescence was defined as negative. table 3 in silico coverage of the primers and probes in the multiplex rrt-pcr assay. a the host parameter from the influenza virus resource database was "human". b the parameters selected from the influenza virus resource database were "coding region", "full-length sequences only", "remove identical sequences" and "include lab strains". c "hits" were calculated using an in-house program (s base matching c or g base, y base matching c or t base and r base matching a or g base) considering degenerate bases. d "hits" were determined by the accurate match between the sequence data consensus and its probe.2.6. sensitivity, reproducibility, and specificity of the multiplex rrt-pcr assaythe titres of the three known influenza a virus strains (seasonal h1n1, h3n2 and pandemic a/h1n1 2009), influenza b virus, oc43 and ad35 were measured by 50% tissue culture infective dose (tcid 50 ) and calculated by the reed-muench method (cunningham, 1973) . copies of rna extracts of the three known and 11 unknown subtypes of influenza a virus strains were quantified by sybr green rrt-pcr. quantification was done using a standard curve made by serial dilutions of pgem-np, a plasmid containing a partial np gene of influenza a virus (data not shown). the limits of detection (lods) were determined using 10-fold serial dilutions (10 8 -1 copies/reaction or 1.8 × 10 4 to 1.8 × 10 −6 tcid 50 /ml) of the quantified viral rna extracts and of the plasmids cloned with genes of influenza a viruses including h1-2009, n1-2009, h1, n1, h3, n2, and m. in addition, another five clinical respiratory specimens positive for influenza b virus (#426a), influenza c virus (#828a), adenovirus (#8313), human metapneumovirus (hmpv; #1152a) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (piv3; #2722) were recruited for the cross-reaction assay. viral rna extracts were tested at high concentrations (10 8 copies/reaction above the lod) ( table 2) to determine the analytical specificity of the rrt-pcr assay. other respiratory viral nucleic acid extracts including influenza b virus, coronavirus oc43 and adenovirus were tested at high tcid 50 s ( table 2 ). the analytical reproducibility assay was calculated at a degree of dilution of 10 5 copies/reaction (3.6 × 10 −2 tcid 50 /reaction for influenza b virus). all of the analytical assays were run at least three times and each run was performed on different days. inter-assay and intra-assay variability (coefficient of variation, cv), both measures of the reproducibility of the rrt-pcr assays, was determined by the following formula:sd c t s: standard deviation of c t values; mean c t s: mean c t values.the primer sequences of conventional rt-pcr for subtyping of seasonal influenza a viruses were provided by the cnic. the sequences and nucleotide positions of the primers were h1-f768: 5 -actactggactctgctggaac-3 (768-788nt), h1-r1094: 5 -caatgaaaccggcaatggctcc-3 (1094-1073nt) for the h1 subtype; n1-f1059: 5 -aaggggttttcatacagggtatggt-3 (1059-1083nt), n1-r1165: 5 -tctgtccatccattaggatcc-3 (1165-1185nt) for the n1 subtype; h3-f671: 5 -atcagggagagtcacagtctc-3 (671-691nt), h3-r940: 5 -atgcttccatttggagtgatgc-3 (940-919nt) for the h3 subtype and n2-f779: 5 -ggaaatcgttcatattagcccattg-3 (779-803nt), n2-r955: 5 -agcacacataactggaaacaatgc-3 (955-932nt) for the n2 subtype. conventional rt-pcr assays were performed and optimised using the superscript tm iii one-step rt-pcr system with platinum ® taq dna polymerase (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, 5 l of each nucleic acid sample were added to a 20 l master mix containing the following components at the indicated final concentrations: 1× reaction buffer, 1 l of superscript tm iii rt/platinum ® taq mix and 500 nm of each primer. thermocycling was carried out as follows: 1 min at 60 • c, 10 min at 42 • c, 30 min at 50 • c and 15 min at 95 • c for reverse transcription (rt) and denaturation; 35 cycles at 94 • c for 30 s, at 52 • c for 30 s, and at 72 • c for 1 min, followed by 10 min at 72 • c. amplified products were analysed using electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.purified pcr amplicons were cloned into the pgem-t easy vector (promega, madison, wi) and sequenced using an abi3730 dna analyzer (applied biosystems, norwalk, ct).statistical significance for the multiplex rrt-pcr assay and other standard detection methods such as for conventional subtyping pcr and the us cdc's real-time pcr was determined via mcnemar's chi-square test for matched pairs. a p-value ≤0.05 was considered significant.to evaluate the coverage of all the primers/probes designed for the new multiplex rrt-pcr, an in silico analysis using an in-house program was performed (see section 2.1). the results showed that the coverage of these primers/probes -including sequences acquired from the literature (whiley et al., 2009 ) and from the who -was 90.1-100% (table 3) .to assess the specificity of the multiplex rrt-pcr, the sequences of primers/probes were analysed by blast analysis. no crossreactivity with other respiratory viruses was found (data not shown). subsequently, the cross-reactivity of the singleplex primers/probe was examined using a panel of virus strains and clinical specimens (table 2 ). no obvious cross-reactivity was observed within influenza a virus type and its subtypes nor with influenza b virus type or any other respiratory viruses. in addition, one (a/beijing/4046/2008) of the 11 influenza a virus isolates with unknown subtypes was identified as the h1n1 subtype, and the other 10 strains as the h3n2 subtype (table 2) . these results were confirmed by subsequent sequencing of the pcr products. all of the specific reactions had high positive fluorescence signals. the mean c t s were in the range of 15.3-22.7, the standard deviations (sds) of the c t values ranged between 0.0-0.4, and the coefficients of variation (cvs) were all less than 5%. these data demonstrate the high specificity of the primers/probes designed for this novel multiplex rrt-pcr assay.the limits of detection (lods) for each influenza virus in the multiplex reaction ranged from 10 to 10 4 copies/reaction (table 4 ). the lod for pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 detected by h1-consensus primers/probe in set 1 was 10 7 copies/reaction (6.67 × 10 2 tcid 50 /ml). however, as the lods of the h1-2009 in set 1 and the n1-2009 in set 2 were 10 4 and 10 2 copies/reaction, respectively, the detection sensitivity of pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 was not affected. the cvs of the c t values of the lods were all less than 4% based on statistical analysis, suggesting that these results were reproducible.reproducibility of the multiplex rrt-pcr assay a . b rxn refers to "reaction". c n refers to "nondetectable".to assess the reproducibility of the multiplex rrt-pcr assay, mean c t values and sd c t s were calculated at 10 5 copies/reaction for influenza a viruses and at 3.6 × 10 −2 tcid 50 /reaction for influenza b viruses. the results showed that the cvs were 0.08-0.97% for intra-assays and 0.04-0.45% for inter-assays, suggesting that the multiplex rrt-pcr assay is highly reproducible (table 5) .to validate the performance of the new multiplex rrt-pcr assay, parallel detections were performed using conventional subtyping pcr protocols recommended by the cnic and the us cdc's protocol for pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 with a panel of 151 clinical samples. the results of these detections and those for influenza a virus subtyping are summarised in table 6 .the multiplex rrt-pcr assay subtyped the 105 seasonal influenza a viruses into 34 h1n1 and 71 h3n2. furthermore, the multiplex rrt-pcr assay identified four new h1n1 and four new h3n2 strains, which had not been identified by conventional pcr previously. these new strains were confirmed through sequencing of the pcr products. statistical analysis (table 6) suggested that there were significant differences between the new multiplex rrt-pcr and the conventional subtyping pcr in the detection of seasonal influenza a virus (p = 6.15 × 10 −5 ) and in h1n1 subtyping (p = 8.74 × 10 −4 ). however, there was no significant difference between the two methods in h3n2 subtyping (p = 0.13). based on these observations, the new multiplex rrt-pcr assay is more sensitive in subtyping influenza a viruses than the conventional pcr techniques.the newly developed multiplex rrt-pcr showed high consistency (96.88%) in detecting pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009. this is consistent with us cdc's rrt-pcr protocol, as no significant differences were found between the two assays (p = 1.00) (table 6) . interestingly, sample #ls1125-4, which was identified as "pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 positive" by the us cdc's rrt-pcr, was subtyped as h3n2 with the multiplex rrt-pcr assay. the identification of h3n2 was later confirmed by sequencing the pcr product.in this report, a new and rapid four-tube multiplex rrt-pcr system for influenza virus diagnosis was developed. this system can simultaneously detect pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 virus, distinguish seasonal influenza a and b viruses, and subtype influenza a viruses into three ha and three na subtypes (pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009, seasonal h1n1, and h3n2) (fig. 1) . the assay improves on current standard assays and may aid in minimizing the transmission of pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 by identifying and distinguishing new cases of pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 from seasonal influenza.the newly developed multiplex rrt-pcr system has several advantages over other assays for detection of influenza viruses. first, it is more sensitive than conventional pcr assays in subtyping influenza a viruses (p = 6.15 × 10 −5 compared with seasonal influenza a virus detection; and p = 8.74 × 10 −4 for h1n1 subtyping). the analysis of the lod for pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 virus indicates that the strategy of multiple-targeting detection ensures the sensitivity of the assay system and effectively lowers the false-negative rate. second, owing to the de-novo design of primers/probes for two target genes (h1-2009 and n1-2009 of the pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 virus, and h3 and n2 +  119  18  137  0  31  31  52  13  65  68  4  72  0  2  2  31  0  31  −  0  14  14  0  120  120  0  86  86  0  79  79  0  149  149  1  119  120

2009 virus (fig. 1a) and that of the h3n2 subtype ( fig. 1c and fig. 2a) .as shown here, one sample identified as pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 by the us cdc's rrt-pcr assay was confirmed to be the h3n2 subtype by the new assay. based on sequence alignment, the h1-2009 primers/probes had very low homologies with that for h3n2 (fig. 2b) . however, there were high homologies between the sw h1 primers/probes of the us cdc's rrt-pcr and some h3n2 strains (such as a/hong kong/1-9-ma21-3/1968, a strain that is highly homologous to the sequencing product of this test). in particular, the sw h1 reverse primer has eight continuous matches with ha sequences found at the 3 end in h3n2, an important terminal site for primer specificity (kwok et al., 1990; peacey et al., 2009) (fig. 2c) . third, in the new multiplex rrt-pcr system, the consensus primers/probes cover the majority of ha and na sequences of each human influenza a subtype (h1, h3, n1 and n2) found in the influenza virus resource database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/flu/) (table 3) . this allows the new assay to identify a wide range of influenza subtypes, as seen in tables 6 and 2 , which present data for subtyping 105 randomly selected influenza a virus positive samples collected between january 2007 and december 2008, and 11 influenza a virus isolates of unknown subtypes. fourth, the new multiplex rrt-pcr assay is highly flexible, as primers/probes can be easily adapted for the detection of some other or newly occurring subtypes of influenza viruses. this adaptation would make the multiplex rrt-pcr a useful platform for the simultaneous detection and surveillance of multiple influenza viruses and/or possibly other pathogens.in summary, a rapid multiplex rrt-pcr assay with high analytical sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility has been developed. the assay will be useful for the surveillance, control, and prevention of pandemic influenza a/h1n1 2009 and seasonal influenzas.others [5] . the advantages of using such a system is its rapid production, it is 53 quantifiable, and is relatively safe since progeny viruses can only undergo a single 54 replication cycle [6, 7] . in the lentivirus-vector system, although most of the vectors 55 are derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), modified versions of 56 the lentivirus vector are non-pathogenic [8] . this is also the case in the vsv-δg 57 pseudovirus system. in this system, the vsv-δg vector lacks the g envelope protein 58 of vsv, thus allowing for recombination with a foreign envelope protein and/or 59 reporter gene. establishment of pseudoviruses using the lentivirus-vector system have 60 been previously reported for emerging and re-emerging viruses that require bsl-3/4 61 facilities such as niv to generate sars-cov or sars-cov-2 and avian influenza virus pseudovirus, 94 we applied the lentiviral vector system provided by national rnai core of academic 95sinica taiwan to produce the pseudoviruses expressing full-length s protein and 96 ha/na proteins, respectively. for sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudovirus, the 97 sequences of s protein were de novo synthesized. synthesized genes were cloned into 98 pmd.g plasmid to express sars-cov or sars-cov-2 pseudoviruses. for avian 99 influenza virus pseudovirus, ha and na sequences from different avian influenza 100 viruses h5n2, h5n6, and h5n8 (h5nx) were synthesized and replaced the vsv-g 101 envelope glycoprotein in pmd.g plasmid. cloned plasmids were transformed into 102one shot stbl3 chemically competent cell (invitrogen) and were amplified in 103lysogeny broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. plasmids were extracted by zymo 104research midi kit. the 293t cells were seeded at the concentration of 2x10 6 cells in 105 6-well plates at 37°c with 5% co 2 for 24 hours, and then the cells were transfected 106 with 1 μg of pcmvdeltar8.91, plas2w.rfp-c.pneo and pmd.g plasmids (pmd.g 107 with s gene for sars-cov or sars-cov-2 tagged by ha on the c-terminus and 108 pmd.g with indicated ha and na gene pairs for avian influenza virus, respectively) 109 by polyjet reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (fig. 1 ). in the following in following the generation of the pseudoviruses, we first focused on 212 group, and maximum % rfp achieved 31.05% referring to 3.85 x 10 6 tu/ml. taken 227 together, the tu result implied similar pseudovirus production efficiency between 228 sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in our lentiviral pseudovirus system. 229early sars coronavirus reports have shown that s1-s2 cleavage can be 230 enhanced by exogenous proteases, such as trypsin, thermolysin, and elastase [16, 39] . 231next, we examined whether exogenous trypsin increases the transduction efficiency 232 of our generated sars-cov and sars-cov-2 pseudovirus. we added exogenous 233 trypsin during sars-cov and sars-cov-2 pseudovirus absorption to vero-e6 cells, 234 until we harvested cells for cytometry analysis. unexpectedly, we observed a 235 reduction in virion transduction with trypsin presence, especially for sars-cov 236 virions. with trypsin treatment, the tu of sars-cov virions decreased 93% from 9.5 237x 10 5 to 6.5 x 10 4 tu/ml. in contrast to dramatic tu reduction of sars-cov virions, 238 the tu of sars-cov-2 moderately reduced 43% from 1.09 x10 6 to 6.2 x 10 5 tu/ml 239 (fig. 4b) . the transduction reduction effects of exogenous trypsin presence since after successfully establishing emerging virus sars-cov-2 pseudovirus 281 transduction and neutralization assays, we next investigated the generated 282 pseudovirions of re-emerging virus avian influenza virus h5nx. in contrast to using influenza h5nx subtypes showed similar transduction unit (tu) within 10 6 to 10 8 290 tu/ml in mdck cells (fig. 3c) although the diverse tus were seen among the 291 subtypes. we thus successfully transduced pseudovirions of re-emerging avian 292we next examined the applicability of avian influenza virus h5nx pseudovirus 294 in neutralization assay. contrast to single type of sars-cov-2 due to only one 295 dominant strain, various avian influenza virus subtypes co-circulated in worldwide. 296taiwan and worldwide, including h5n2, h5n6, and h5n8 subtypes to determine the 298 neutralization antibody by using h5nx pseudovirus. instead of raising antibody by 299 structural protein expressing recombinant protein subunit vaccine in sars-cov-2 300 virus, we concentrated the inactivated avian influenza pseudovirus as immunogens to 301 raise antisera against avian influenza ha and na structural proteins in mice. we 302 determined neutralization antibody titers of raised antisera against different subtypes 303 of influenza virus and generated an antigenic map to analyze the similarity of 304 antigenicity according to neutralization antibody titers. mouse antisera were 305 respectively generated by each selected strain and examined neutralization activities 306 against all selected avian influenza pseudovirions. neutralization titers demonstrated 307 that avian influenza virus exhibited partial cross-reactivity among h5n2, h5n6, and 308 h5n8 subtypes. high neutralization titers of antisera between 1:160 and ≧1:5120 309were observed among examined subtypes ( although on average high neutralization titers were generally seen among the antisera 316 against diverse subtype pseudovirus, we still observed the 2 to 8-folds of different 317 titers among examined pseudovirions as which were neutralized by each antiserum. diarrhoea is a common problem in young calves and a cause of impaired animal welfare. farmers may suffer large economic losses due to veterinary treatments, mortality and reduced growth rates. calf diarrhoea has a multifactorial aetiology, and cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite that is frequently associated with the disease (de la fuente et al. 1999; joachim et al. 2003; snodgrass et al. 1986 ). the parasite is resistant in the environment (fayer 2008) , creating high infection pressures in some affected herds. other common diarrhoeal pathogens are rotavirus, coronavirus and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli f5+ (barrington et al. 2002; de la fuente et al. 1999; foster and smith 2009 ). e. coli f5+ causes diarrhoea in calves younger than 1 week, whereas the other three pathogens mainly cause diarrhoea in 1-to 3-week-old calves. individual calf factors such as failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies, and management associated factors such as personnel and stable hygiene, routines at calving, milk feeding regimens and crowding, affect the course of disease (barrington et al. 2002) .a limitation with previously performed studies on the association of diarrhoea and cryptosporidiosis in calves is that all oocysts approximately 5 μm in diameter until recently were recognised as c. parvum. however, molecular diagnostic methods have shown that three morphologically similar species, c. parvum, cryptosporidium bovis and cryptosporidium ryanae, can be found in cattle.several studies applying dna analysis have identified c. parvum in 88.0-95.5% of preweaned calf diarrhoeal samples, with c. bovis and c. ryanae detected in 0-5.9% and 1.6-5.9% of samples, respectively (plutzer and karanis 2007; soba and logar 2008; thompson et al. 2007) . in contrast to c. parvum, c. bovis, c. ryanae and a fourth larger species, cryptosporidium andersoni, are considered to be associated with subclinical infection in cattle (fayer et al. 2007; langkjaer et al. 2006) . we have shown that cryptosporidium parasites are ubiquitous in swedish dairy herds but we found no association between infection and diarrhoea in individual calves (silverlås et al. 2009 ). with the help of dna analysis, we identified c. bovis as the most prevalent species (74%) in preweaned calves, and c. parvum, c. bovis and c. ryanae were all detected in diarrhoeal calves (silverlås et al. 2010) . it is thus not correct to conclude that diarrhoea is associated with c. parvum solely based on the presence of c. parvum-like oocysts. the improved diagnostic methods call for to further examine the relationship between cryptosporidium infection and diarrhoea. it is also important to identify additional factors affecting the course of infection because a key component for improved calf health in herds with cryptosporidium-associated diarrhoea is to decrease infection pressure by improved management. the objective of this herd level case-control study was to investigate the role of cryptosporidium infection, with the added value of information on the different cryptosporidium spp. in swedish dairy herds facing a problem with calf diarrhoea. to get a more complete picture of the diarrhoeal problems, other pathogens and animal and management factors were also investigated.ten case herds and 10 control herds with ≥50 milking cows/year were included. case herds were defined as herds that had current problems with diarrhoea in calves. each case herd was matched to a control herd (without calf health problems) with approximately the same number of cows and situated in the same veterinary district. possible case and control herds were identified by herd health veterinarians, who had followed these herds over several years and thus had a long-time insight into the calf health of each herd.a questionnaire was designed to get information about herd structure and management factors believed to influence prevalence of cryptosporidium-infected and diseased animals. questions were grouped as follows: general herd information, routines at calving, calf management, disease in calves, weaned calf and young stock management. the questionnaire is available in swedish from the first author upon request.sampling procedure and data collectionthe study was conducted during the indoor seasons (mid october to end of march) 2006-2007 (n=3 pairs) and 2007-2008 (n=7 pairs) , and each herd was visited once. samplings were done by herd health veterinarians or by author cs. matched case-control herds were sampled by the same veterinarian within a week from each other. a total of eight veterinarians participated. detailed instructions about sampling procedures and data collection were sent to participating veterinarians to minimise personnel bias. rectal faecal samples were collected from 10 calves (≤2 months old), 10 young stock (4-12 months old) and five periparturient cows (1 week before expected partus to 2 weeks post partum). any additional calves with diarrhoea were also sampled. eight herds had insufficient number of calves, young stock or periparturient cows at sampling, in which case all calves or young stock in the preset age interval and five cows as close to the preset interval as possible were sampled. jugular vein blood was collected in serum tubes from a maximum of five 1-to 8-day-old calves in each herd. for sampled calves, a number of parameters, e.g. age, the consistency of faeces, general condition, pen environment and any medical treatment (drug, disease and dates of treatment) were recorded. for sampled young stock and cows, consistency of faeces and age were recorded. for cows the number of days in relation to calving was also recorded. the visiting veterinarian completed the questionnaires through interviews with the farmers.detection of cryptosporidium oocysts and dna analysis of cryptosporidium positive samples all faecal samples were processed by a saturated sodium chloride flotation method and analysed for cryptosporidium oocysts by epifluorescence microscopy as described previously (silverlås et al. 2009 ). the detection limit of this method is 50-100 oocysts per gram faeces (opg) (andersson 2004) . concentrated samples were stored at 4-8°c.the aim was to analyse two samples positive for c. parvum-like oocysts (∼5 μm ø) from each age group and herd. if more than two positive samples were present, random selection was done. all samples with the larger c. andersoni oocysts (∼5×7.5 μm) were analysed. dna was extracted using a combined freeze-thawing and qiaamp dna stool mini kit (qiagen) protocol. a nested pcr protocol for amplification of a ∼800-bp segment of the 18s rrna gene and sequencing of pcr products was used for species determination. samples containing c. parvum were subtyped through amplification of a ∼800-bp segment of the 60-kda glycoprotein (gp60) gene using a nested pcr protocol and sequencing. all methods have previously been described (silverlås et al. 2010 ).detection of other pathogens and control of colostral uptake all calf faecal samples were investigated for presence of rota-and coronavirus, whereas presence of e. coli f5+ was investigated in samples from calves ≤14 days. faeces for viral and bacteriological analyses were frozen at arrival to the laboratory, and thawed and analysed at the end of each sampling season. total protein (tp) in blood was estimated the day samples arrived at the laboratory.rotavirus and coronavirus were detected by indirect antigen elisas. e. coli f5+ was detected by cultivation on blood agar and agglutination test of a few, randomly selected colonies. these methods are used in the routine diagnostics at the swedish national veterinary institute (sva).blood samples were centrifuged at 1500×g for 10 min at room temperature, and tp was assessed by refractometry of the serum. calves with ≥55 g/l tp were considered to have sufficient colostral antibody uptake (radostits 2000) .statistical analysis was done using stata 10 (© 1984-2008, statacorp, college station, tx, usa). an animal was considered cryptosporidium positive if at least one c. parvum-like oocyst or c. andersoni oocyst was detected in the microscope. statistical calculations were done at herd and calf level, using χ 2 test, fisher's exact test or the mann-whitney test. epidemiological modelling was done at calf level to determine factors associated with being a case herd calf, using logistic regression with robust standard errors to adjust for clustering of observations within herds. variables were first screened in univariable logistic regression models, and variables with p≤0.25 were considered for further analyses. collinearity between variables was investigated using spearman rank correlations. multivariable modelling was done by forward selection, using p≤0.05 as a retaining criterion. confounding was assessed as each variable was entered or deleted from the model. if the odds ratio (or) of any variable category changed >25%, the confounding variable was retained in the model. when a final main effects model had been achieved, previously deleted variables were re-entered and evaluated again, and then two-way interactions were investigated. the final model was diagnosed using the pearson goodness-of-fit test and the receiver operating characteristic curve, and plotting deviance and pearson residuals against the linear prediction of residuals. any detected outliers were investigated further.eight of the case herds had a long-time history of diarrhoeal problems (at least since the preceding indoor season) and two herds had a sudden outbreak of diarrhoea and mortality. in total, 483 faecal samples from 100 cows, 187 young stock and 196 calves, and 47 blood samples were collected. median age of all sampled calves was 25.5 days (n=96) in control herds and 24 days (n=114, range 2-62 days) in case herds (p = 0.68, mann-whitney test). median age of sampled diarrhoeal calves was 20 days (n=9, range 2-62 days) in control herds, and 29.5 days (n=22, range 9-62 days) in case herds (p=0.50, mann-whitney test).cryptosporidium-positive animals were identified in all herds. mono infection with c. parvum-like oocysts was identified in 208 animals and with c. andersoni oocysts in four animals. in addition, five animals had both c. andersoni and c. parvum-like oocysts, giving in total 217 cryptosporidium-positive animals (44.9% prevalence). overall mean prevalence in case herds was 45.7% and in control herds 41.7%. group specific mean prevalences in case vs. control herds were: 61.6% vs. 64.6% in calves, 42.1% vs. 34.7% in young stock and 23% vs. 14% in cows. neither overall mean prevalence nor group specific mean prevalences differed between case and control herds (p> 0.05, mann-whitney test). the prevalence of cryptosporidium shedders in relation to age was similar in case and control herd calves, with a maximum prevalence in the third to fourth week of life in both groups (fig. 1) .shedding rates of c. parvum-like oocysts were 100−2× 10 8 opg in calves (n=129), 100−45,900 opg in young stock (n=70) and 100-650 opg in cows (n=14). shedding rates of c. andersoni were 100-1,200 opg in calves (n=3), 100 opg in young stock (n=2) and 100-1.65×10 6 opg in cows (n=4).≤1 w 3-4 w 7-8 w 1-2 w 4-5 w 8-9 w 2-3 w 5-6 w 6-7 w cryptosporidium species and c. parvum subtypes of 94 samples subjected to dna analysis, 75 (80%) were successfully amplified at the 18s rrna locus. of these, 59 were c. bovis, eight were c. parvum, six were c. ryanae and two were c. andersoni. c. bovis was identified in all herds, whereas c. parvum was identified in one control herd and four case herds, c. ryanae in two control herds and four case herds and c. andersoni in two case herds. species distribution did not differ significantly between case and control herds (p>0.05, fisher's exact test). c. bovis was identified in all age groups, c. ryanae in calves and young stock, c. parvum in calves and c. andersoni infection was only confirmed in cows (table 1) . data on species distribution in individual animals from case and control herds are given in table 1 .all eight c. parvum samples were successfully sequenced at the gp60 locus. they belonged to subtypes iiaa16g1r1 (n=5), iiaa17g1r1 (n=2) and iiaa21g1r1 (n=1). subtype iiaa17g1r1 was the only one detected in diarrhoeal calves.data on distribution of rotavirus, coronavirus and e. coli f5+ in calves from case and control herds are given in table 1 .mono infection with rotavirus or coronavirus was present in four and two calves, respectively. mixed infections were present in 16 calves as follows: rotavirus and c. parvum (n=3), rotavirus and undetermined c. parvum-like spp. (n=7), rotavirus and e. coli f5+ (n=1), coronavirus and c. bovis (n=1) and coronavirus and undetermined c. parvum-like spp. (n=3).diarrhoea was present in 22 calves from nine of 10 case herds (herd prevalence 0-40%, median 20%) and nine calves from six of 10 control herds (herd prevalence 0-25%, median 10.6%) at sampling. a significantly higher proportion of case herd calves had diarrhoea (p=0.03, χ 2 ), and herd prevalence differences approached statistical significance (p=0.08, mann-whitney test). the case herd without diarrhoeal calves was one of the herds that suffered from an acute outbreak. the matched control herd also had only healthy calves at sampling. pathogens detected in diarrhoeic calves were: c. parvum, c. bovis, undetermined c. parvum-like spp., rotavirus and coronavirus ( table 1) . one of the diarrhoeic coronavirus-positive calves had a few c. parvum-like oocysts of undetermined species, but otherwise no co-infections were detected in diarrhoeic shedding rates for different cryptosporidium species in diarrhoeic vs. non-diarrhoeic calves were 12,750−3×10 6 opg vs. 2,800−2×10 8 opg (c. parvum), 9,250−2×10 6 opg vs. 1,200−1.65×10 6 opg (c. bovis) and 100−3.5× 10 6 opg vs. 100−6.65 × 10 6 opg (undetermined c. parvum-like spp.). no significant differences were found. in comparison, shedding rates in the non-diarrhoeic calves with c. ryanae were 3,650-500,000 opg.management routines, total protein and mortality disinfection of single pens between calves was more common in case herds (p=0.02, fisher's exact test). used disinfectants were virkon (viroderm; n=3), stalosan f (svenska lantmännen, containing phosphates, kaolin, iron and copper compounds; n=3), stalosan f and virkon (n=1) and stalosan f and powdered hydrated lime (n=1). several other differences in case and control herd management were indicated although significant differences were not detected or statistical tests could not be performed due to zero observations in some categories. these variables are presented in table 2 . all control herds fed colostrum by bottle, whereas routines varied in case herds. two case herd and two control herd farmers routinely checked colostral quality. total protein ranged from 42-71 g/l (median 55 g/l) in 25 case herd calves and from 44-66 g/l (median 57 g/l) in 22 control herd calves (p=0.18, mann-whitney test). all farmers stated that they had storage of frozen colostrum.neonatal mortality was registered as number of deaths before weaning in the last 20 calves born alive. calves had died in six case herds and in one control herd (table 2) . mortality was mostly due to diarrhoea, but respiratory disease, trauma and unknown causes were also registered. no calves had been treated prophylactically or therapeutically against cryptosporidiosis prior to sampling.seven variables had p≤0.25 in univariable modelling ( table 3) . the multivariable regression model contained three significant variables and one confounder (table 3) . 'c. bovis status' gave reduced odds of belonging to a case herd, but calves with unknown c. bovis status (undetermined c. parvum-like spp.) did not differ from calves negative for c. bovis (i.e. cryptosporidium negative or infected with c. parvum or c. ryanae). the variable 'c. parvum identified in herd' did not produce a significant odds ratio, but acted as a confounder for both 'disinfection of single pens' and 'most common type of diarrhoea'.odds of being a case herd calf were higher if the type of diarrhoea varied considerably, compared to if pasty diarrhoea was most common in a herd. there was also a tendency of higher odds in calves from herds where watery diarrhoea was most common. when a farmer reported to routinely disinfect single pens between calves, the odds of being a case herd calf were higher than if disinfection was not a routine. no significant interactions were detected. the model had a rather poor fit (table 3) , but the area under the receiver operated characteristics curve was 0.91 (maximum 1) and no residual outliers were detected.the complexity of cryptosporidium infection and its association to clinical symptoms is reflected in that we found cryptosporidium-infected calves in all investigated herds and similar shedding rates of c. parvum, c. bovis and undetermined c. parvum-like spp. in diarrhoeic and nondiarrhoeic calves, which shows that massive c. parvum infection is not sufficient to produce diarrhoea. shedding rates approximately follow bell shaped curves over time, and shedding intensity and diarrhoeal intensity seem to peak around the same time (jarvie et al. 2005; joachim et al. 2003; lallemond et al. 2006; lefay et al. 2001; villacorta et al. 1991) . for calves with high c. parvum shedding rates, it is thus likely that the parasite is associated with diarrhoea, and the identification of high numbers of c. bovis oocysts in diarrhoeic samples indicates that this species can cause diarrhoea in calves. c. bovis has been associated with subclinical infection (santín et al. 2004 ), but massive intestinal invasion with subsequent diarrhoea should be possible if enough other factors, such as lack of passive immunity, are present, even if this species would lack virulence factors similar to those present in c. parvum.the interpretation of diarrhoeal samples containing a few oocysts is not as straightforward, especially when such a sensitive diagnostic method as ours is used and only one sample per calf is collected. because intestinal damage is caused by the intracellular parasite stages, diarrhoea might be present already when the first few oocysts are shed because these do not reflect the intensity of intestinal invasion. moreover, calves with failure of passive transfer of colostral antibodies have poor health to start with, and might develop diarrhoea more easily and at a lower degree of intestinal invasion than calves with sufficient passive transfer. on the other hand, if the few oocysts reflect lowgrade infection, the real cause for diarrhoea could be an unidentified pathogen. repeated samplings are crucial to confirm or reject the association between infection and diarrhoea in these calves, but that could not be done in this study.we have earlier identified the c. parvum subtypes iiaa16g1r1 and iiaa21g1r1 found here in swedish cattle (silverlås et al. 2010) , whereas subtype iiaa17g1r1 was first identified in this study. we found subtype iiaa16g1r1 in one non-diarrhoeic calf in the preceding study (silverlås et al. 2010 ) as well as in five non-diarrhoeic calves from this study, but this subtype and iiaa17g1r1 have both previously been identified in diarrhoeic calf samples (plutzer and karanis 2007; soba and logar 2008; thompson et al. 2007) . we were first to report subtype iiaa21g1r1 in two calves (silverlås et al. 2010) , and this subtype has now been identified in three non-diarrhoeic calves in total. the gp60 locus used to identify these c. parvum subtypes encodes a glycoprotein situated in the apical region of invasive stages of the parasite. gp60 subtypes are also identified in the human species c. hominis and have been associated with varying pathogenicity in hiv patients (cama et al. 2007 ). due to the low number of subtyped samples in this study, conclusions about pathogenicity or association with diarrhoeal problems cannot be made.this study was designed at herd level, and diarrhoeic calf samples were not targeted for dna analysis. still 40% of diarrhoeic cryptosporidium-positive calf samples were sequenced, compared to 28% of non-diarrhoeic samples. although only two cryptosporidium-positive calf samples per herd were subjected to dna analysis, these represented a random sample and should not bias the species distribution. at least one of the investigated pathogens were detected in most diarrhoeic samples but an equal or even higher percentage of the non-diarrhoeic calves also harboured them. in addition, only one of 16 calves with mixed infections had diarrhoea. about half of all diarrhoeic calves were older than 4 weeks. this indicates that other diarrhoeal causes such as eimeria spp., or dietary imbalances could also be present in the herds of this study. however, diarrhoeal pathogens outside the "c. parvum diarrhoeal window" were not targeted because the main focus was to investigate the role of different cryptosporidium species in herds with diarrhoeal problems. the reason for including calves older than 4 weeks is that we have shown cryptosporidium infection to be common in this age group (silverlås et al. 2009 ). preweaned calves are often kept close together so these calves may act as an important infection source for the younger ones. indeed, a high prevalence in old calves was shown in this study as well (fig. 1) . young stock and cows were also included to get an impression of the overall cryptosporidium infection pressure in the herds.even though rotavirus and coronavirus are considered major diarrhoeal pathogens in calves, they were uncommon also in case herds in the present study. we have no explanation for the results regarding rotavirus. we used the same elisa, and the same person performed the (björkman et al. 2003; de verdier klingenberg and svensson 1998) . the coronavirus results are not so surprising. björkman et al. (2003) found a low prevalence (3%) of coronaviruspositive diarrhoeal samples, and in a recent norwegian study (gulliksen et al. 2009 ) no diarrhoeal samples were positive for coronavirus. in addition, our results are supported by snodgrass et al. (1986) who found coronavirus to be equally common in healthy and diseased calves. the low prevalence of e. coli f5+-positive samples was in accordance with previous studies (björkman et al. 2003; de verdier klingenberg and svensson 1998) . other pathogens such as salmonella spp. have been reported as common calf diarrhoeal pathogens (barrington et al. 2002) . in addition, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bvdv) is recognised as an important calf health modulator worldwide, among other things causing immunosuppression and diarrhoea. as a result of successful control programmes, bvdv and salmonella are uncommon in swedish cattle, with 99.8% of herds being free from bvdv (professor stefan alenius, personal communication), and salmonella only being identified in five to 13 herds per year (anonymous 2007). although diarrhoea was more common in case herd calves, in total only 31 of 196 sampled calves had diarrhoea at sampling. this could be due to naturally fluctuating infection pressures. even if diarrhoeal prevalences were quite low in case herds and pathogen distribution was similar in healthy and diarrhoeal calves from case and control herds, the identification of herds as cases or controls were performed by veterinarians with insight into the herds' calf health status. we thus are confident that cases and controls were correctly classified. ten case-controls is a small sample size, but a larger sample was not possible for logistic reasons.several variables indicated differences between case and control herds (table 2) , and more case herd calves had diarrhoea compared to control herd calves. at a glance, individual calving pens, colostral feeding by bottle etc were more common in control herds, indicating better management routines and thus better biosecurity. management routines in case herds also seemed to vary more than in control herds (table 2 ). all case herd farmers applied at least one good management routine, but which one(s) differed. this indicates that different routines have to be addressed to improve biosecurity in the case herds.because of the differences in colostrum feeding strategies between case and control herds, we did not expect median tp values to be comparable. both case and control herd calves had median tps close to the acceptable value of 55 g/l (radostits 2000) , which shows that approximately half of all calves had insufficient colostral uptake. colostral routines obviously needed improvement, but just as much in control herds as in case herds.a swedish study including 8,964 heifer calves noted a 3.1% mortality rate in the first 90 days from birth (svensson et al. 2006) . accepting a 5% mortality rate (i.e. one of 20), three case herds and one control herd had elevated mortality rates (10-15%).an interesting finding was that disinfection of single pens between calves was much more common in case herds. the same association has been shown for weaners . this association could be seen as an effect-i.e. herds with diarrhoeal problems start to disinfect. however, because these herds still had problems, disinfection seemed either not to work or to be insufficient. moreover, if disinfection routines were started a short time prior to sampling, the full effect might not have been reached at the time of sampling. we did not ask about how long these routines had been used, and cannot investigate this possibility further because of the high risk of recall bias. a potential explanation for disinfection not working is that farmers rely on the disinfectant to do the work of reducing infection pressure instead of cleaning thoroughly. without proper cleaning, only the surface of the dirt layer is disinfected, pathogens can continue to thrive beneath, and calves are exposed again as soon as the top layer is disrupted. cryptosporidia are resistant to most commercial disinfectants (fayer 2008) . thus, if cryptosporidia constitute a large part of the problem even proper disinfection that reduces viral and bacterial pathogens would not be successful. of the disinfectants used by farmers in this study, virkon has not proven effective against cryptosporidium oocysts (fayer 2008, table 1.9) . lime seems to reduce oocyst numbers (graczyk et al. 2008; zintl et al. 2010) . these studies used quicklime (cao) on sewage sludge (graczyk et al. 2008) or hydrated lime (ca [oh] 2) in water solution and purified oocyst solutions incubated in used bedding material (zintl et al. 2010 ). the effect of powdered hydrated lime on faecal oocysts has to our knowledge not been tested. still, this might be at least partially effective in reducing oocyst load. we have not been able to identify references concerning the components of stalosan f. drying and heating are effective for decreasing oocyst viability (fayer 2008 , table 1 .7). thus, proper cleaning (with water), followed by drying and use of powdered quicklime, or the use of deep litter bedding (provided that the surface is regularly overlaid with dry, clean bedding material) might be two effective ways of keeping cryptosporidium infection pressure down.model of factors associated with being a case herd calfcalves infected with c. bovis had lower odds of belonging to a case herd, indicating that c. bovis is more common in herds without diarrhoeal problems, and that c. parvum is really the species associated with diarrhoea. the fact that disinfection of single pens was identified as a risk factor could have several explanations that have already been discussed. the type of diarrhoea most common in preweaned calves could also be seen as an effect rather than a risk for belonging to a case herd. this variable was introduced in the model as an indicator of total infection pressure, hypothesising that a low total infection pressure would be more associated with pasty diarrhoea and that a high total infection pressure would be more associated with watery diarrhoea. because some farmers stated that the type of diarrhoea varied considerably, this represented a third level of the variable. indeed, although the level watery diarrhoea tended to have higher or, this was the level that produced a significantly higher or compared to pasty diarrhoea. a highly fluctuating infection pressure, due to e.g. long time between thorough cleaning of pens or fluctuations in calving intensity, could explain the significant association.cryptosporidium infection was equally common in case and control herds, showing that these parasites can be abundant without causing diarrhoeal problems. our results emphasise that management factors are important to whether diarrhoea will develop or not after infection with one or more of the investigated pathogens, including the pathogenic cryptosporidium species c. parvum.in december, 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause appeared in wuhan, hubei province, china. by 7 january 2020, china rapidly isolated the novel coronavirus and shared the viral genome sequence to world health organization (who) [1] . the novel coronavirus was identified as a novel enveloped rna betacoronavirus and named 2019 novel coronavirus (later named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [sars-cov-2] by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses), which has a phylogenetic similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), but the contagosity is higher than sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) [2] . in order to prevent the epidemic of this contagion, chinese government made a decision to temporarily shut down the traffic departing from wuhan on 23 january 2020 and adopted a series of control measures. who declared the spread of sars-cov-2 was listed as a public health emergency of international concern, and subsequently designated the pneumonia infected by sars-cov-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) [3] . until 19 april 2020, covid-19 has swept across 213 countries and regions which reported 2 245 872 confirmed cases and 152 707 deaths. the largest number of confirmed cases were in the united states, followed by spain and italy [4] . this phenomenon signified fighting with covid-19 is not only a matter for china, but an imperative event for global.nowadays, the majority of studies on covid-19 in china are focused on wuhan, the hardest-hit area, and little is known about the clinical features of covid-19 outside of wuhan [5] [6] [7] . the study of chang et al. [8] included 13 cases in beijing and the research of xu et al. [9] enrolled 62 cases in zhejiang, however, due to the small sample size, clinical characteristics might be not comprehensive. researches with a larger number of confirmed cases were urgently needed outside of wuhan. the clinical spectrum of covid-19 appears to be wide, comprising mild type without pneumonia, common type with pneumonia, severe type with respiratory distress, and critical type with respiratory failure, shock or even death [10] . diverse subtypes have their unique features, whether in epidemiology or laboratory results. a study with 72 314 cases reported by the chinese center for disease control and prevention (china cdc) showed that the case-fatality rate was 49.0% among critical cases [11] . therefore, mastering the characteristics of different subtypes and early identification of the severity of illness is of great significance for the treatment.hence, the aim of our study is to summarize the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiograph findings, treatments, and outcomes of different subtypes of patients with covid-19 in zhejiang province. on this basis, we want to explore risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with covid-19 and appeal to clinicians to attach importance to these factors.we conducted a retrospective study investigating on the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiograph, treatments and outcomes characteristics of confirmed cases of covid-19 in zhejiang province from 17 january to 12 february 2020. diagnosis of covid-19 was in accordance with the interim guidance from the who [12] . a confirmed case of covid-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay of sputum and throat swab specimens. only laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled in our study. data were uniformly collected by the health commission of zhejiang province, where all patients were allocated at specific hospitals for unified treatment according to the government emergency rule. all data enrolled in our study had been shared with who and the preliminary results were reported to the authority of zhejiang province.information of medical records were gathered and sent to the data collection center in hangzhou. demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatments and outcomes data were exacted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. a group of doctors who have experiences in treating the patients with covid-19 reviewed and disposed the data. when information was incomplete, the working team in hangzhou would contact the doctor in charge for explanation.this study was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the first affiliated hospital, college of medicine, zhejiang university (no. iit20200005c). written informed consent was waived by the ethics commission of the designated hospital, and oral consent was obtained from patients.sputum and throat swab specimens collected from all patients were tested by rt-pcr for sars-cov-2 rna. briefly, the cdc of zhejiang province and at municipal level, and the first affiliated hospital, school of medicine, zhejiang university were responsible for confirmation of sars-cov-2, with national authorization.laboratory tests were conducted on admission, including blood routine examinations, serum biochemical tests, coagulation function examinations, infection-related biomarkers, and an identification of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza a virus, influenza b virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. chest radiograph or computed tomography (ct) was done for all inpatients at admission. treatment measures and outcomes were followed up to 12 february 2020.the illness severity of covid-19 was defined according to the chinese management guideline for covid-19 (version 6.0) [13] . patients with covid-19 was categorized as mild, common, severe, and critical according to the illness severity. mild type was defined as mild symptoms and no pneumonia on imaging. common type was defined as having respiratory tract symptoms and imaging with pneumonia. severe type was defined as satisfying any of the following items: 1) respiratory distress and respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min; 2) blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93% at rest; 3) pao 2 /fio 2 ratio ≤ 300 mmhg; 4) lung infiltrates > 50% within 24-48 h. critical type was defined as satisfying any of the following items: 1) respiratory failure occurs and require mechanical ventilation; 2) shock occurs; 3) combined with other organ failure and requires icu monitoring and treatment. the incubation period was defined as the time from exposure to the onset of illness, which was estimated among patients who could provide the exact data of close contact with confirmed or suspected individuals. family cluster was defined as occurring two or more cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms within the family in recent 2 weeks. fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37.3°c. gastrointestinal symptoms included nausea, emesis and diarrhea.once the temperature returned to normal for more than 3 days, respiratory symptoms significantly improved, the imaging of lung obviously absorbed, and two consecutive negative results for sars-cov-2 antigen (sampling interval at least 1 day), patients could be discharged from hospital.continuous variables were presented as median (interquartile range [iqr] ) and compared using kruskal-wallis. categorical variables were presented as frequency (percentages), and compared using the χ 2 test or fisher's exact test when appropriate.to analyze risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with covid-19, univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were used. variables with p < 0.05 in the univariate models were selected into the multivariate model for calculating. a two-sided α of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. all the analyses were done with spss version 25.0 (ibm corporation, armonk, ny, usa).the kaplan-meier method was used to estimate hospitalization time, and the log rank test was applied for comparisons among mild, common, and severe type. the kaplan-meier analysis was performed using 'survival' packages in r version 3.6.1 (r foundation, vienna, austria).from 17 january 2020 to 12 february 2020, clinical data were collected on 788 patients with covid-19 in zhejiang province. according to the definition of clinical classification, they were divided into 52 cases (6.6%) of mild type, 658 cases (83.5%) of common type, 61 cases (7.7%) of severe type, and 17 cases (2.2%) of critical type.as shown in table 1 , the median age in mild, common, severe, and critical type was 37.5 years (iqr: 19. .5%, respectively. hypertension was the most common underlying disease and there were significant differences among the four subtypes (9.6% vs 13.2% vs 31.1% vs 88.2%, p < 0.001). in both severe and critical type, the ratio of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms exceeded 15%.on admission, the majority of leucocyte in all subtypes were normal or decreased. as shown in table 2 , the four types had significant differences in neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelets count, albumin (alb), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), sodium, blood urea nitrogen (bun), creatinine (cr), creatinine kinase (ck), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), c-reactive protein (crp) and procalcitonin (pct) (p < 0.05). in contrast, there were no significant differences in hemoglobin, international normalized ration (inr), alanine aminotransferase (alt), total bilirubin (tb) and potassium (p > 0.05).multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity were typical imaging manifestations of patients with covid-19. the proportion of it in common, severe, and critical type were 27.8, 60.7, and 88.2%, respectively.patients with covid-19 were quarantined in designated hospital and a total of 668 patients received antiviral treatments in our research. as shown in table 3 , interferon-α inhalation, lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol were the most commonplace antiviral regimen in all subtypes. glucocorticoids were not used in mild type, but in all critical types, and there were significant differences in the use among the four types (0.0% vs 8.2% vs 47.5% vs 100.0%, p < 0.001). similar to glucocorticoids, there were significant differences among the four types based on the use intravenous immunoglobulin (0.0% vs 3.6% vs 42.6% vs 70.6%, p < 0.001). till 12 february 2020, none of patients used extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) and continuous renalreplacement therapy (crrt).at the endpoint of our study, 21 cases (40.4%) of mild type, 273 cases (41.5%) of common type, 27 cases (44.3%) of severe type, and 1 case (5.9%) of critical type discharged from hospital, and none of the patients died. kaplan-meier analysis showed a significant difference in hospitalization time among mild type, common type and severe type (fig. 1) .as shown in table 4 the outbreak of covid-19 is now becoming an enormous threat to public health. with further research of the structure and infection mechanism of respiratory, scientists found angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) might be the site of sars-cov-2 binding on the surface of cells, with the same route of infection of sars-cov [14] . it has been proved that ace2 might play an important role in virus transmission and infection. sars-cov-2 not only attacked the lung but also caused damages to many other organs, including heart, kidney, liver and central nervous system [3, 6, 15, 16] . the diagnosis of covid-19 was complicated by the diversity in symptoms, imaging findings and the severity of illness, therefore, describing features of each subtype and exploring risk factors for the severity of illness could help clinicians to better tackle with this disease. in this respective study, the median age of critical types was higher than the other three types, with the reason of low immunity and degeneration of related physiological function in older. the length of the incubation period is related to many factors, such as the number of pathogens, the time required for toxin production and transmission, and human immunity. the incubation period was shorter in severe type, probably due to poor immunity and higher viral load [17] . fever and cough were the dominant symptoms in all subtypes, while hemoptysis was rare. fever is a protective mechanism by activating the immune systems to resist pathogens, and cough is a reflective defense against invaders.when an individual was infected, the above two symptoms generally appeared at early stage. although hemoptysis was an atypical symptom, it was reported that there was covid-19 patient admitted only with hemoptysis as the initial symptom [18] . moreover, we should be alert to the patients who didn't have a fever, due to 6.6% of severe type without fever in our study. hypertension and diabetes were the most pervasive underlying diseases in all subtypes, and the proportion of them were higher in critical type. in consideration of the aged constituting the majority of the critical type, it is common that the rates of comorbidities increased. according to the laboratory results, the decrease of lymphocyte occurred in 70.6% of critical type. the decrease of lymphocyte was a prominent feature of critical type in our cohort which was consistent with a previous study [19] . sars-cov-2 might mainly act on lymphocyte, especially t lymphocytes, as did sars-cov [6] . in addition, the increased ast and ldh implied a potential of liver and heart damage which was more common in severe and critical types.currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for covid-19 [20] . in the light of the previous clinical experience, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol were applied for antiviral therapy in our hospital, however, the therapeutic regimen was not researched a consensus among hospitals. a retrospective study identified that proper use of corticosteroid in critical type with sars could lead to a lower mortality and shorter hospitalization stay [21] . in our study, the dosage of glucocorticoids was limited to 40-80 mg/d to avoid side effects. until 12 february 2020, 21 cases (40.4%) of mild type, 273 cases (41.5%) of common type, 27 cases (44.3%) of severe type, and 1 case (5.9%) of critical type discharged from hospital.compared with initial patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan, the illness condition of patients in zhejiang province are relatively milder. none of the patients died at the end of our follow-up. this feature is obviously different from researches in wuhan which reported a higher mortality [10, 19] . at early stage of outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan, shortage of local medical resources, insufficient understanding of this disease and no effective drugs might contribute to this phenomenon.several risk factors for the severity of illness in patients with covid-19 were identified in our study including male, fever, cough, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, and higher age-grading. several studies demonstrated that differences in covid-19 disease prevalence and severity were associated with sex, which was similar to our results [3, 6, 19] . one study, using single-cell sequencing, found that expression of ace2 was more predominant in asian men [22] . during the evolution, females develop enhanced innate and adaptive immune responses than males and are less susceptible to viral infections [23] . these above two points might be the reasons for the higher prevalence and severity of covid-19 in men than in women. additionally, in our study, the presence of any one of the comorbidities was higher in male compared with female (30.7% vs 24.4%, p = 0.048). we thought this result might also partly explain why men are more prone to severity illness.our study found increasing odds of the severity of illness was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. a bioinformatics analysis on single-cell transcriptomes demonstrated that ace2 was not only highly expressed in the lung at2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. recently, two independent laboratories from china declared that they have successfully isolated live sars-cov-2 from the stool of patients [24] . an increasing number of studies remind us that digestive system might serve as an alternative route of infection for sars-cov-2 [25] . we consider the digestive tract transmission of sars-cov-2 might impair the function of intestinal mucosal barriers and increase the production of inflammatory factors, further aggravating the severity of illness.in addition, covid-19 patients combined with hypertension were at higher risk for the illness severity in our study. renin-angiotensin system (ras) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. it could be simply summarized as two axes, one is ace-ang ii-at1 axis responsible for constriction of blood vessels, and the other is ace2-ang-(1-7)-mas axis with the opposite effect [26, 27] . generally, the two axes could interact with each other and maintain the blood pressure balance. however, the balance would be broken in hypertension, with the result of a lower expression of ace2. once infected by sars-cov-2, the level of ace2 would be even lower, followed by intensified ang ii activity. ang ii would further promote vasoconstriction, increase vascular permeability and mediate inflammatory responses, leading to illness aggravation.there are several limitations in our study. firstly, the retrospective design of our study might affect integrality of data and diminish its credibility, and more prospective cohort studies should be on the agenda in the future. secondly, patients enrolled in our study only come from zhejiang province, and large-scale researches at the national level were urgently needed which could provide more reliable and comprehensive data. thirdly, changes of the illness in different subtypes needed to be further investigated. a model for predicting the changes of disease was necessary for clinicians to better guide treatments. moreover, laboratory results were not included in ordinal logistic regression model to explore risk factors for the severity of illness, due to the normal range of some indicators varied from different hospitals.in summary, our study reported the largest cases of patients with covid-19 in zhejiang province, and indicated risk factors of illness severity which was of great significance for early identification and prompt treatment. based on the research findings, we recommend that clinicians should pay close attention to these features in patients with covid-19 including older age, male, fever, cough, hemoptysis, gastrointestinal symptoms and hypertension, and strengthen self-protection during the outbreak of covid-19. transmission of infections between humans through a respiratory route is well established and dependent on pathogens being carried in secretions that are transmitted between individuals as aerosols, droplets, secretions or via direct mucosal contact. viruses have adapted to the human population over many millennia, 1 and many have now evolved to exclusive transmission in humans through the respiratory route, yet the disease they cause is not restricted to the respiratory system. examples of viruses causing systemic disease transmitted through the respiratory route include measles and erythrovirus b19. other human viral infections cause respiratory system disease and transmit through respiratory secretions; for example, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), rhinoviruses and human adapted strains of influenza a, which cause seasonal epidemics, and influenza b and c, which are human pathogens. the outcome of infection and clinical disease presentation is partly dependent on virus factors, which restrict viral replication to certain cell types (tissue tropism).sporadic transmission of viruses from their natural animal host to humans can cause zoonotic infections with disease of varying severity and epidemic scale, depending on the virus. for many of these infections, humans are dead-end hosts. such infections are usually well recognized, with effective control measures to limit human disease; examples include rabies. however, new infectious agents of man are described at regular intervals. for the last decade at least one significant new human pathogen has been identified almost every year, involving a diversity of organisms. the rate of identification of new viruses has increased in recent years with the application of genomics, which has facilitated the detection of organisms that could not previously be cultivated (table 1 ). 2 approximately 75% of all newly described human pathogens (emerging diseases) are rna viruses, many of which are transmitted through a mucosal or respiratory route. not all of these cause serious human infections. some may be viruses that have been in the human population for decades or even centuries without an animal reservoir, but through the application of improved diagnostic techniques are now recognized, such as human metapneumovirus (hmpv) ( illness, or an unusual severe illness requiring critical care, without obvious animal exposures, and may be detected as a result of an astute clinician requesting detailed diagnostic testing to rule out known infections. evaluating the importance of a newly emerging virus is dependent on understanding the host range, disease and pathogenesis in man, transmissibility and likelihood of sustained transmission in human population.the term pandemic is usually taken to indicate a very widespread epidemic with an infection that has the capacity to cause disease on a global scale. a new influenza a virus in the human population, known as pandemic influenza, has the greatest impact on human populations as a result of morbidity and mortality in all age groups, 2 through the respiratory route, with potential to cause much more widespread disease. the genetic characteristics of viruses that emerge to cause serious human respiratory disease, with pandemic potential, may be diverse.influenza viruses have a segmented negative-sense genome of approximately 15 kb, and exist as three different types: a, b and c. influenza b and c, which are well-recognized human respiratory pathogens, have limited genetic diversity and are adapted to transmission exclusively in humans. disease caused by influenza c is markedly milder than that caused by influenza a or b. occasional transmission of influenza b to mammalian species such as seals and influenza c to pigs has been described.in contrast, there are many different subtypes of influenza a viruses, all of which naturally infect water-based wild birds, usually with very little disease. 2 influenza a viruses have a broad host range with the potential to infect a wide range of animals ( figure 3 ). influenza a viral subtypes are distinguished according to their surface proteins, haemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na). seventeen ha subtypes and nine na subtypes are found circulating in the wild, giving rise to over 150 different subtype combinations. there is great genetic diversity within influenza viruses in wild bird populations as a result of the ability of viruses to recombine segments. not all different influenza a subtypes are established in man or mammalian hosts. only a limited number of subtypes have adapted to circulation in mammalian species, including humans, horses and swine. currently seasonal influenza a epidemics are caused by influenza a h1n1 or h3n2, which have adapted from the original avian host to transmit through respiratory secretions and cause respiratory tract infections in humans. 2 emergence of pandemic influenza: role of poultry and swineavian influenza a subtypes are transmitted through a faeco-oral route and virus can be shed in high quantity in the environment following replication in the gastrointestinal tract in wild birds. there is frequent spillover of avian influenza a subtypes into domestic poultry reservoirs, as a result of shared habitats with wild birds. replication in poultry may be associated with disease in poultry of varying severity or may be asymptomatic, depending on the viral subtype and the poultry species. domestic poultry may therefore act as a source of transmission of zoonotic influenza a subtypes to humans. this has been demonstrated with h5n1, which is highly pathogenic in poultry and more recently with h7n9, which is less highly pathogenic in poultry. 2since march 2013, approximately 150 cases of human infection with influenza a (h7n9) have been reported from eastern china. the pathogenicity of the virus is high in humans, and higher age appears to be a risk factor; the median age of cases is 64 years, with a range between 4 and 89 years. approximately one-third of cases have been fatal to date. there is currently no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. the latest epidemiological data are available from the who: http://www.who.int/ influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index. html.genetic analysis of a (h7n9) isolates has identified mutations, which suggests that the virus may have a greater ability to infect mammalian species, including humans, than most other avian influenza viruses. small family clusters have been reported. there is limited evidence for human-to-human transmission of this emerging influenza virus. the source and mode of transmission of influenza a (h7n9) have not yet been confirmed, but most cases have reported contact with poultry or live animal markets. 5e7pigs are also considered a mixing vessel for the reassortment of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses. until the 1990s, classic swine influenza a (h1n1), the most commonly circulating swine influenza virus among pigs, remained fairly constant. however, by the late 1990s, different subtypes (h1n1, h3n2, and h1n2) had emerged and became predominant among north american pig herds. these swine influenza a viruses acquired avian, human and swine virus gene segments through reassortment, and various genetic lineages can be distinguished within each subtype. in europe, swine influenza is caused primarily by the same subtypes. however, the antigenic and genetic characteristics differ significantly from those found in north america and asia. genetic diversity has been expanded through multiple introductions of influenza viruses from other animal hosts into pig herds including from humans, most recently demonstrated with h1n1 pdm 2009 virus in europe, asia, and the americas. 2 recent events confirm the important role of swine in the emergence of novel influenza viruses capable of causing a human pandemic, with the emergence of h1n1 pdm 2009 from a swine reservoir in north america. this h1n1 was sufficiently different from seasonal h1n1 previously circulating since 1977 to show sustained transmission in humans and eventually to replace the previously circulating h1n1 variant. since 2009, other variant influenza h1n1 and h3n2 viruses circulating in the swine population of north america have also emerged to cause sporadic infections. 8seasonal influenza seasonal influenza a and b illness in humans ranges from subclinical or mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to more severe illness, including laryngotracheitis and pneumonia, or less commonly, death from respiratory system failure. the most common presenting symptoms are cough, high temperature, joint pain and general malaise. the rapid onset and short incubation period are characteristic, though incubation can last up to 4 days. individuals at greatest risk of complications are those with pre-existing cardiac and respiratory disease, the elderly, and those with impaired immunity. the severity of illness reflects pre-existing host immunity and the prevailing virus strain. 2disease caused by pandemic influenza a in 2009 was considered to be of moderate severity, with a similar range of presentation to that of seasonal influenza a, including typical symptoms of fever, cough and sore throat. younger people were more commonly affected, particularly for fatal or severe disease. this is in stark contrast to seasonal influenza, which generally has a more severe impact on the elderly (over 65 years) population. severe respiratory failure is seen in a small proportion of cases, with certain underlying medical conditions posing an increased disease caused by novel swine variants of influenza arising from circulating viruses in swine populations is largely indistinguishable clinically from seasonal influenza, but the mean age of presentation occurs in the young population, under 16 years, with an exposure history to swine. 9 disease due to h5n1 or h7 disease presentation following zoonotic infection with these avian subtypes of influenza tends to be more severe, with a longer prodrome. often the presentation may be that of a viral pneumonia, without the prominent features of cough and upper respiratory tract syndromes with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). following zoonotic transmission of non-human subtypes of influenza a to humans, viral receptors and replication competence will affect the tropism of the virus, and the tissues and body fluids in which the virus may be detected, as has been demonstrated for h5n1 and h7 viruses. in this situation, a broad range of tissues may yield infectious virus recovery and a different spectrum of illness, in contrast to seasonal influenza virus infection. this would include evidence of leucopenia at presentation, which is not a typical feature of seasonal influenza. a history of exposure to poultry, with recent travel to parts of the world where avian influenza is endemic, may be an important diagnostic clue; also, conjunctivitis has been a clinical presenting feature associated with h7 infections involving h7n7, h7n2 and h7n3, but does not seem to have featured in h7n9 infections. 9an influenza pandemic poses a significant risk to human health, and spreads rapidly around the globe, as was seen in 2009. every attempt is made to ensure that influenza viruses with pandemic potential are controlled in their animal reservoirs, but once a new variant has emerged into the population several countermeasures are undertaken. in order to pose a pandemic threat, a novel influenza virus (or any other virus with pandemic potential) must satisfy two separate criteria. first, the virus itself must be capable of efficient transmission between humans; and second, the virus must be antigenically novel, such that a large proportion of the population are serologically naïve and fully susceptible to infection, and so will support its onward transmission.the presence of a large mobile animal reservoir of influenza a virus suggests that eradication of this agent will be impossible. control strategies focus on limiting the opportunities for crossspecies transmission of novel subtypes; for example: housing domestic poultry in shelters to avoid contact with migratory/wild birds (improving biosecurity) eliminating/reducing live bird markets housing aquatic birds and domestic poultry separately slaughtering flocks infected with avian influenza h5 and h7 raising awareness of potential for acquisition of influenza from swine.these measures may achieve some success in prevention of zoonotic transmission of influenza a to humans, but have little impact on its annual cycle in humans. unprecedented levels of h5 and h7 circulating in south east asia and elsewhere present a high risk for emergence of a novel pandemic influenza a strain, particularly as it is recognized that relatively few mutations are required to alter the transmission characteristics of avian viruses to those more adapted to respiratory transmission in humans.the mainstay of control of influenza is vaccination. the basis of vaccination against influenza is the observation that infection with influenza generates neutralizing antibodies to the viral surface proteins, predominantly ha. these antibodies will protect against infection with the same strain of influenza, and may give limited protection against closely related strains. vaccines used in humans are designed to elicit high levels of antibody to viral ha protein. the more distant an influenza virus, the less protective the antibodies generated by natural immunity or vaccination will be. as human influenza drift variants arise frequently, it is necessary to update vaccines on a regular basis. influenza vaccines are given annually, before the influenza season, so that those with the highest risk factor may benefit from boosted immunity. in developed countries, there has been an expansion of vaccination policies to ensure that individuals aged over 65 are vaccinated, irrespective of pre-existing illness, and every effort is made to target those with risk factors in younger age groups. vaccination rates vary considerably between developed countries, and between the developed and the developing world.in 2013, for the first time in the uk, live attenuated vaccines (laiv) will be used to vaccinate children over 2 years and under 16 years. laiv are particularly suitable for children as they can be given intranasally without the use of needles. the vaccines undergo limited replication in the nasal cavity and induce both humoral and cellular immunity, which is more broadly protective. vaccines used for seasonal vaccination of older adults and elderly are subunit-inactivated vaccines that do not replicate. they are intended to boost pre-existing immunity, to reduce the likelihood of severe infection.there are no widely available vaccines for h7 or h5 influenza, and although there have been several clinical trials of vaccines against h5, these viral targets are not included in seasonal vaccines.despite the protective efficacy of vaccination, the need for treatment of severe influenza remains, particularly in the case of zoonotic infections. na inhibitors (nis) are the most widely used class of anti-influenza compounds. they act on the viral surface protein, na, prevent release of viral particles from infected cells and are most effective when given early in illness. use in the pandemic of 2009 has confirmed that, when given early during illness, drugs can prevent severe outcomes (death and critical care hospitalization) and may also have benefit in severe infection, even if given late. 10 in the uk in 2000, the national institute for health and care excellence (nice) has recommended that ni drugs may be used for prophylaxis and treatment, with certain restrictions.other anti-influenza drugs that target other viral proteins such as polymerase are being progressed through drug development pipelines. when such drugs are licensed they will enhance the ability to treat infections and avoid the emergence of drug resistance that occurs in the severely immunocompromised host, and with higher frequency in treated children. in immunocompromised individuals, influenza a replicates to high viral load in the absence of immune responses, and infection may become persistent, giving prolonged shedding of unusual drug-resistant variants that are difficult to treat. intravenous immunoglobulin usually contains high levels of neutralizing antibody to influenza, and may be useful in treating severely immunocompromised individuals who are unable to clear seasonal influenza infections. children may be more likely to generate resistant viruses following treatment, as a result of higher viral shedding in the absence of pre existing immunity.the emergence of drug-resistant influenza is dependent on drug, viral and host factors. viral factors include the na subtype of influenza, with n1-containing viruses more likely to sustain the mutations in viral na to inhibit drug binding (and thereby generate resistance) compared with n2-containing viruses. the most commonly described mutation associated with na drug resistance is the histidine-to-tyrosine shift (h275y) seen in h1n1 or h5n1 viruses, which reduces oseltamivir susceptibility by over 600-fold. this is associated with clinical resistance to drug. however, even when resistant virus emerges in an individual during the course of treatment as a species detectable towards the end of a treatment course, it may not have any clinical consequence for the individual in whom resistance is detected if that individual is immunologically normal, or the infection is with seasonal influenza. the ability of drug-resistant influenza to transmit occurred during 2007/2008 with seasonal h1n1, although this virus has now been replaced with pandemic h1n1, which remains sensitive to oseltamivir. 11 individuals with a compromised immune system are more likely to generate drug-resistant variants, and require additional therapy with drugs directed at alternative targets or the use of immunotherapy. there is increasing interest in combination therapies with some of the unlicensed alternative antiviral drugs (polymerase inhibitors) or diverse neuraminidase inhibitors that are given intravenously, which may have a slightly different resistance profile.coronaviruses have a large, positive-sense segmented rna genome of approximately 30 kb and infect a diverse range of animals, including domestic and companion animals of man. it is considered most likely that coronaviruses in these animals originated from a bat reservoir, and became established in many secondary hosts. coronaviruses show great adaptability in host range, and as a result can establish and sustain, in a wide range of species, infections that may then spillover into man. this was seen in 2003 with sars being transmitted from civet cats, which were a permissive secondary host.since the identification of sars in 2003, 12 several other new respiratory coronaviruses of humans have been identified, including nl63 and hku1 virus. these are in addition to known human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e, which have been recognized as a source of milder respiratory infections in humans for several decades. as a result of sars, much greater attention has been given to this group of viruses generally, with the result that many new viruses in animals have also been identified. coronaviruses group genetically into four major groups, with human viruses found in three of the four major groups, although the greatest diversity of coronaviruses is found in bats. 13 the first indication of a new viral infection in humans was the detection of clusters of illness in south east asia. this virus spread worldwide in early 2003, with over 8000 cases and approximately 10% fatalities before the disease was brought under control through application of public health control measures, such as quarantine of infected individuals and strict infection control in hospital settings. risk factors for sars were:close contact with civet cats eating/preparing civet meat laboratory work with sars contact with a known case.in 2012, a new coronavirus, mers-cov, was identified in cases of severe respiratory illness as a result of clinical vigilance. 14, 15 since original notification, this virus has affected over 100 people in nine countries with a high (50%) case fatality rate, 16 as a result of acute lung injury following viral replication in lower respiratory tract. all cases so far have a link to the arabian peninsula. the virus has a zoonotic origin, probably from an animal species indigenous to this region. cases occur in a sporadic pattern, with human-tohuman transmission in small family or healthcare clusters. 16e18 risk factors for mers-cov include: contact with known case travel to the arabian peninsula. exposures or behaviours giving rise to this infection are currently unknown. once the condition has been diagnosed, supportive care and lung protective ventilation are required, if the case requires hospitalization, with strict attention to infection control. no specific interventions are available. update on cases is available from the who website.adetecting pathogens in respiratory infections is crucial for diagnosis, patient management, and to avoid improper antibiotic treatment and unnecessary laboratory testing. however, the goldstandard methods for detecting viral infections, non-molecular methods, have critical limitations such as the requirement of labor-intensive and complex procedures and time-consuming steps [1, 2] . therefore, in many instances, cell culture is no longer considered the gold-standard method, and molecular assays have become the standard of care for diagnosis [1, 3] . multiplex real-time pcr is useful for diagnosing respiratory viral infections because the process time is faster than that of viral culture, it detects multiple pathogenic viruses simultaneously, and it is reli-able [3] .the allplex respiratory panel 1/2/3 (all16, seegene, seoul, republic of korea), which detects 16 respiratory viruses simultaneously with influenza a virus (flua) subtyping, represents the first clinical assay based on multiple detection temperature (mudt), which enables the detection of multiple targets in single-channel multiplexing without melting curve analysis via realtime pcr [4] . it covers adenovirus (adv); coronavirus 229e (229e), coronavirus nl63 (nl63), and coronavirus oc43 (oc43); flua and influenza b virus (flub); human bocavirus 1/2/3/4 (hbov); human enterovirus (hev); human metapneumovirus (mpv); human rhinovirus a/b/c (hrv); parainfluenza virus 1 (piv1), parainfluenza virus 2 (piv2), parainfluenza virus 3 (piv3), and parainfluenza virus 4 (piv4); and respiratory syncytial virus a (rsva) and respiratory syncytial virus b (rsvb). additionally, it is a one-step pcr assay and is therefore much simpler than other commercial multiplex pcr assays for respiratory viruses. thus, we evaluated the performance of all16 compared with anyplex ii rv16 (any16, seegene), which also detects 16 viruses without flua subtyping. additionally, we analyzed the test time and hands-on time from the start of nucleic acid extraction until result acquisition.we we also evaluated cross-reactivity with 24 common respiratory pathogens received from the chonbuk national university hospital branch of the national culture collection for pathogens (see supplemental table s1 ). the mean test time and hands- inter-rater agreement statistics (kappa values) were obtained to compare the detection of respiratory viruses between all16 and any16, and we analyzed the sensitivity and specificity based on the monoplex pcr results. this study was exempted by the institutional review board of chonbuk national university hospital (irb no. cuh 2015-11-029) with low ethical load, not specifying the request of informed consent to the patient because all the studies were done after data was anonymized.a total of 256 and 250 samples were positive in all16 and any16, respectively. when a sample was positive for more than one virus, regardless of the virus type or discrepancy, the positive percent agreement between all16 and any16 was 93.2% (95% confidence interval [ci], 89.4-95.7), and the negative percent agreement was 84.7% (95% ci, 78.0-89.6). the kappa value for the two methods was 0.78 (95% ci, 0.72-0.85). results for each virus are summarized in table 1 . eighteen samples in all16 were found to be h1 or h3 (14 and 4 samples, re-spectively) by flua subtyping, and these results were consistent with the sequencing results targeting the hemagglutinin gene of flua. further comparison of flua subtyping with the filmarray findings showed consistent results for another 26 samples with h3 subtyping.seventy-four samples showed discrepant results between the two assays, and 68 discrepant samples showed positive results with only one method. two samples showed discrepancies between the two methods, and the results for four samples were completely different between the assays. for further analysis, we performed monoplex real-time rt-pcr for samples with discrepant results, specifically all16-positive and any16-negative samples; this analysis yielded 83.6% (46/55) consistency with the all16 results. for samples with discrepancies involving all16 negativity and any16 positivity, rate of consistency with the any16 results was 34.6% (9/26). the discrepancies for each virus are described in table 2 . additionally, we analyzed the sensitivity and sensitivity of each assay after resolving discrepant results (table 3) ; the analytical specificity test of all16 for 24 bacteria showed all negative results.when 28 samples were analyzed simultaneously, the test time abbreviations: see table 1 ; ci, confidence interval. and hands-on time showed mean times of 4.3 and 0.5 hour, respectively. the mean times required for dna extraction and pcr preparation using microlab nimbus ivd and pcr itself were 2.4 and 1.9 hours, respectively, and both analyses required less time than any16. both multiplex rt-pcr assays, all16 and any16, are based on tagging oligonucleotide cleavage and extension technology, but all16 utilizes mudt technology. multiplex real-time pcr typically requires either multiple fluorescence channels or a melting curve analysis step after amplification [5, 6] . the mudt technology saves time because the melting curve analysis step is unnecessary. a 2.2-hour reduction in the test time for all16 is achieved, regardless of the sample number, compared with any-16; this finding reflects the application of mudt and a one-step process, including pcr and cdna synthesis, in all16 compared with the two-step analysis, including pcr amplification after cdna synthesis, used in any16. reduction of the hands-on time, workload, and test time because of the simple one-step analysis with mudt used in all16 is helpful in clinical laboratories.results obtained using the newly developed all16 test showed good agreement with any16 results. for each virus, the positive and negative percent agreement showed good results. however, slight discrepancies were observed for hev and piv3; discrepancies in hev results might reflect low viral loads or primer com-petition. any16 detected more positive results for hev than that by all16. the analytical sensitivity of all16 is reported as 50 copies/μl, except for when piv1 is analyzed, yielding a sensitivity of 10 copies/reaction, and when piv4 and mpv are analyzed, with a sensitivity of 10 3 copies/reaction [7] . in contrast, the sensitivity of any16 under the same conditions is approximately 6 copies/ μl [8] . based on the manufacturer's package inserts, the analytical sensitivities of any16 and all16 are 50 copies/reaction and 100 copies/reaction, respectively. therefore, hev results were consistent with the package inserts. additionally, any16 involves a two-step analysis with pcr following cdna synthesis. separation of the cdna synthesis step from pcr might have influenced hev rna purity or extraction, but other rna virus results were inconsistent with this. therefore, we speculate that the results were likely due to primer competition.hrv results from all16 were more sensitive and specific than results from any16 in this study. discrepancies in results were likely due to broader primer coverage for various hrv genotypes according to the primer information provided by the manufacturer (data not shown).regarding piv3, all16 showed more positive cases than any16, and most discrepant results were confirmed as positive (96%, 26/27) via monoplex pcr. in this respect, any16 might miss many cases of piv3, which infects the distal airways and causes www.annlabmed.org https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2018.38.1.46 pneumonia and bronchiolitis [9, 10] . further studies on the detection and clinical investigations of hev and piv3 infections should be conducted.recently, flua subtyping has become more important because of the emergence of avian and swine flua [11] ; however, there are few relevant clinically available assays. we observed good agreement on flua subtyping results between all16 and filmarray.since rapid reporting of viral diseases is critical, rapid pcr assays have been introduced, but these assays have limited throughput. however, according to our analysis, all16 can be performed twice per day without requiring more workers. therefore, if many samples need to be run, all16 could be advantageous, especially compared with any16.the present study has certain limitations. some samples contained viruses at low titers, hindering statistical analyses for certain viruses, such as piv1 and piv4, and could not reflect the entire range of seasonal variations in each viral infection.in conclusion, all16 showed good agreement with any16. its flua subtyping and reduced test time and workload are useful in clinical laboratories. however, further investigations, such as clinical studies of analyses of hev and piv3, are needed.cryptosporidium spp. are ubiquitous protozoan parasites of vertebrates. globally, the zoonotic species, cryptosporidium parvum, is a common species in, and a cause of diarrhoea in, preweaned calves. infection is most prevalent between 1and 3 weeks of age (nydam et al., 2001; santín and trout, 2008) and related symptoms are watery diarrhoea, inappetence, depression and sometimes death (santín and trout, 2008) . calf diarrhoea is a multifactorial disease and co-infection with other pathogens or the presence of non-infectious diarrhoeal causes can lead to more severe disease and higher mortality rates. traditionally, c. parvum has been diagnosed by microscopy of faecal smears or concentrated samples, with or without staining. however, two other species, cryptosporidium bovis and cryptosporidium ryanae, with an oocystmorphology which is similar to c. parvum, can be identified in cattle using dna analysis. differentiation between these three species cannot be made by microscopy. cryptosporidium bovis and c. ryanae are considered to be a pathogenic and are most prevalent after 1-2 months of age (santín et al., 2004; fayer et al., 2006 fayer et al., , 2007 langkjaer et al., 2006) , but possible pathogenic effects of c. bovis on cryptosporidium naïve calves have not been investigated. cryptosporidium parvum has been identified as the main species in young calves, responsible for >80% of cryptosporidium infections (santín et al., 2004; trotz-williams et al., 2006; fayer et al., 2007; plutzer and karanis, 2007; broglia et al., 2008; brook et al., 2009) . however, in sweden and some other countries, c. bovis is the most prevalent species in preweaned calves (silverlås, 2010; wang et al., 2011; budu-amoako et al., 2012; silverlås and blanco-penedo, 2012) . in sweden, c. bovis constituted 50% of the infections during the second week of life and was the most common species from 2 weeks of age. the species was also detected in a number of diarrhoeal calf samples (silverlås et al., 2010a,b) . cryptosporidium analysis has been offered as a part of routine diagnostic services of diarrhoeal calf faecal samples at the swedish national veterinary institute (sva) for many years, but diagnostic procedures do not include species determination. if the cryptosporidium spp. distribution in diarrhoeal calves is the same as in swedish dairy calves in general, i.e. there is a high c. bovis prevalence, species determination should be included in routine diagnostic procedures in order to make it possible to estimate the clinical relevance of cryptosporidium infection.the first aim of this study was to determine whether cryptosporidium routine diagnostic procedures need to be supplemented with cryptosporidium spp. analysis. a second aim was to investigate the spectrum of c. parvum subtypes present in herds with diarrhoeal problems, and whether any subtype seems to be associated with more severe symptoms. finally, the presence of other pathogens and characterisation of the clinical picture at sample and herd levels were investigated and related to cryptosporidium infection.2.1. study design, sample collection and primary analyses ''kalvpaketet'' is a service package offered to farmers by the swedish animal health services (svenska djurhälsovården ab, sweden). the package includes sampling, laboratory analysis and advice for herds with diarrhoeal or respiratory disease problems in young calves. samples are collected by veterinarians in the field and analysed at sva, uppsala, sweden. submissions can comprise up to five diarrhoeal samples or nasal swabs from diseased calves, and blood samples from up to five healthy 1-to 7-day-old calves. all faecal and blood samples sent via ''kalvpaketet'' from herds asking for cryptosporidium analysis from 30 march 2010 to 29 march 2012were included in this study.as soon as samples arrived at sva, a questionnaire asking about calf management and the clinical picture of the calf diarrhoeal problems was sent to the farmer (supplementary data s1). if a herd submitted samples more than once, a new questionnaire was sent if at least 1 month had passed since the last submission or if the farmer had not answered the previous questionnaire.''kalvpaketet'' referrals for diarrhoeal samples can include analysis of cryptosporidium spp., eimeria spp., escherichia coli f5+, salmonella spp., rotavirus and coronavirus (bcv). giardia cannot be requested but is analysed together with cryptosporidium spp., as the immunofluorescent stain used in routine diagnostics (aqua-glo™ g/c direct, waterborne, inc., usa) identifies both pathogens. blood samples from clinically healthy 1-to 7-day-old calves were analysed for serum total protein (tp) as a measure of passive transfer. the age of sampled calves should be noted on the referral.infection is usualy diagnosed by direct microscopy after immunofluorescent staining. the presence of eimeria spp. is analysed in calves p3 weeks of age by the macmaster flotation method. the presence of e. coli f5+ is analysed in calves 62 weeks of age by cultivation on blood agar plates followed by agglutination of one to two representative colonies to determine whether they are f5+. for rotavirus, bcv and salmonella analyses, up to five diarrhoeal samples per herd are pooled at the laboratory and analyses are thus performed at herd level. rotavirus is detected by antigen-elisa, coronavirus by pcr and salmonella by cultivation on specific agars. tp is analysed by refractometry.faecal consistency and colour was registered on arrival or samples at sva. samples diagnosed as cryptosporidium-positive by routine diagnostic methods were further analysed to verify the presence of cryptosporidium and determine the oocyst count, cryptosporidium sp. and subtype.one gram of each cryptosporidium-positive faecal sample was cleaned and concentrated by sodium chloride flotation (silverlås et al., 2009 ) within 1 week of arrival at the laboratory. out of the final 1.5 ml volume; a subsample of 30 ll was used to determine the oocyst count. oocysts were enumerated at 200â magnification by epifluorescence microscopy after staining with fitc-labelled monoclonal anti-cryptosporidium antibodies (cryptocel if test kit, cellabs, australia). the entire 30 ll sub-sample was examined if there were 66 oocysts per field of vision (61000 per 30 ll). if there were >6 oocysts per field of vision, oocysts in 10 fields were counted and the average number was used to estimate the total oocyst count in the sample. samples were stored at 4°c until further analysis.dna analyses were performed every sixth month during the study as described previously (silverlås et al., 2010b) . briefly, dna was extracted from concentrated samples by a combined freeze-thawing and qiaamp dna stool mini kit (qiagen, germany) protocol (quilez et al., 2008) . samples were subjected to nested pcr protocols to amplify $800 bp each of the ssrrna (santín et al., 2004) and 60 kda glycoprotein (gp60) (chalmers et al., 2005) gene loci. species and subtype were determined by sequencing in both directions on an abi 3100 genetic analyzer (applied biosystems, usa) using the internal primers and bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (applied biosystems). vector nti software (invitrogen, usa) was used to assemble consensus sequences and manually correct mismatches. derived sequences were compared with sequences deposited in genbank using blast (basic local alignment search tool, ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi).at the end of the study period, all samples that contained c. bovis were run through ssrrna-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) to identify whether co-infection with c. parvum was present. the secondary pcr products were digested with mboii (new england biolabs, uk) and separated by gel electrophoresis on a 3% metaphor ò agarose gel (lonza, me usa) according to feng et al. (2007) .data were entered into microsoft office excel 2007 spreadsheets (ó2006microsoft corporation). specific datasets were created for (i) extended microscopy and dna analysis, and (ii) questionnaires, as data were entered on sample versus herd levels. in addition, the excel spread sheets that sva creates for ''kalvpaketet'' samples, with information about all referrals, were used because these added information about other pathogens, tp and disease history data for the included herds. the spreadsheets were transferred to stata 11 (ó1985-2009 statacorp lp, college station, texas, usa) and merged for statistical analysis. v 2 test, fisher's exact test (f) and mann-whitney test (mw) were used as appropriate.from 30 march 2010 to 30 march 2012, sva received 268 referrals that requested analysis of diarrhoeal calf samples for the presence of cryptosporidium. the referrals included 801 samples, of which 782 were sent for analysis of cryptosporidium (and sometimes other pathogens), whereas 29 faecal samples were sent for analysis of other pathogens but not cryptosporidium. the referrals also included 125 blood samples for control of tp. referrals were from 192 herds and 51 herds sent samples on two (n = 33), three (n = 15), five (n = 2) or six (n = 1) occasions.cryptosporidium oocysts were detected by routine diagnostic methods in 242 (31.0%) samples from 91 (48.7%) herds. the sample prevalence was 32.7% (141 of 431) in year 1 and 28.8% (101 of 351) in year 2 (v 2 = 1.4, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, p > 0.05). for herds with multiple referrals, cryptosporidium oocysts were identified zero to three times.of 242 cryptosporidium-positive samples, 218 samples from 82 herds contained enough faeces to allow further analysis, and 198 samples were positive by microscopy after concentration. estimated oocysts per gram (opg) in these samples ranged from 100 to 11 â 10 7 . samples determined as cryptosporidium-negative after concentration were considered as false positives.species was successfully determined by ssrrna analysis in 187 of 198 samples (94.4%). four of the 11 samples with undetermined species contained c. parvum subtypes in gp60 analyses, giving a total of 191 samples (96.5%) with successful species determination. cryptosporidium parvum and c. bovis were identified in 178 (93.2%) and 13 (6.8%) samples, respectively. cryptosporidium ryanae was not found. of the 13 c. bovis samples, seven were determined as mixed c. bovis/c. parvum by ssrrna-rflp. sixty-eight herds were positive for c. parvum only, five for c. bovis only and both species were detected in six herds. in three herds with one referral and one cryptosporidium-positive sample each, neither species nor subtype could be determined.by gp60 analyses, subtypes were successfully determined in 171 of 198 (86.4%) samples. of these, 166 were c. parvum and five were mixed c. bovis/c. parvum (table 1 ). the subtype family (sf) but not subtype could be identified in another five samples, because the sequence started within the repetitive region. a total of 27 c. parvum subtypes were identified (table 1) . sixteen new subtypes were identified and submitted to genbank (accession numbers jx183796-jx183811) ( table 1) . six subtypes had a unique number of tca/ tcg repeats, whereas 10 had the same number of repeats as previously reported subtypes but shifts in the tcg position within the repetitive region and/or one or two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the post-repetitive region compared with reported sequences. iia subtypes were most common, with a dominance of subtype iiaa16g1r1 (table 1) . for iid subtypes there was a slight dominance of iida20g1e (table 1) , a subtype variant first reported by us (silverlås et al., 2010b) . three other subtypes, iiaa21g1r1, iida22g1c and iida23g1, which were first reported in sweden (silverlås et al., 2010b) were also identified, as well as a variant of one of those (iiaa21g1b). with the exception of three herds, only one subtype per herd was identified when multiple samples (n = 2-9) were analysed; also in herds with repeated samplings. in one of those three herds, only c. parvum was detected and samples with different subtypes were sent on the same occasion. in the other two herds, subtypes were identified in both c. parvum and mixed c. bovis/c. parvum samples. in one herd, samples were taken 8 months apart and subtypes differed in the c. parvum and mixed c. bovis/c. parvum samples. in the other herd, all samples were sent on the same occasion and two different subtypes were identified in the c. bovis/c. parvum sample, one of those being identical to the c. parvum subtype of that herd. one was a dairy herd, one a fattening herd and for the third herd there was no information about herd type.for statistical analysis of individual samples, calves with mixed c. bovis/c. parvum infection were kept in the c. bovis group at species level and in their c. parvum sf group at sf level. due to the many subtypes present, with few isolates per subtype, data for subtype association with severity of disease was analysed at the sf level. there were 136sample observations for sf iia and 40 observations for sfiid.age had been registered for 173of the 198 cryptosporidiumpositive calves. the oldest positive calf was 90 days old. cryptosporidium parvum-positive calves were significantly younger than c. bovis-positive calves (table 2) . of all c. parvum infections, 138 of 156 (88.5%) were seen at 1-3 weeks of age and 93.9% of all cryptosporidium-positive samples from this age group contained c. parvum. cryptosporidium bovis infections and cryptosporidiumnegative samples were more evenly distributed (fig. 1) . oocyst counts differed significantly by species and there was a tendency towards higher oocyst counts for sf iia compared with sf iid (table 2) .colour and consistency was registered in the laboratory for 239 cryptosporidium-positive samples ( table 2) .yellow colour was significantly associated with c. parvum, whereas there was no difference in faecal consistency between c. parvum and c. bovis samples ( table 2) . sf iia was more common in samples with watery faeces, whereas there was no sf difference related to faecal colour (table 2) .of the 13 c. bovis-infected calves, sixappeared to be mono infections, of which one calf was from a bcv-positive herd. the other seven samples were co-infections with c. parvum. in addition, one of the c. bovis/c. parvum infected calves was co-infected with giardia and five were co-infected with eimeria bovis/zuernior eimeria spp. one of the latter five calves was from a rotavirus-positive herd.because cryptosporidium infection was not detected by routine diagnostic methods after 90 days of age, data for older calves were not included when the presence of multiple calf diarrhoeal pathogens in herds were examined. the presence of one to four other pathogens was detected in 77 of the 82 herds with cryptosporidium-positive samples (table 3) . eimeria spp. was detected in 72, rotavirus in 34, giardia in 21 and e. coli f5+ in four herds. coronavirus was only requested to be examined for three herds and detected in two of those, both cryptosporidium-positive (table 3) . salmonella was requested to be examined for 20 herds but not detected at all. tp values ranged from 39 to 87 g/l (median 56 g/l) in individual samples and from 46 to 70.5 g/l (median 56.5 g/l) at herd level.data on all variables were not available for all herds and thus the number of observations included in different analyses varied. questionnaires were answered for 52 (63.4%) of the 82 cryptosporidium-positive herds. because many farmers checked several questionnaire categories for diarrhoeal prevalence, colour and type of diarrhoea, categories became overlapping and data could not be interpreted.farmers from52 cryptosporidium-positive herds had noted in the questionnaire that 1-100% of diarrhoeal calves were given some kind of rehydration (to drink, by oesophageal tube or i.v.). in 26 herds all diarrhoeal calves needed some sort of rehydration therapy. no differences in rehydration needs were observed between c. parvum (median 82%, range 10-100%, n = 44), c. bovis (median 100%, range 25-100%, n = 4) or c. parvum/c. bovis (median 20%, range 20-100%, n = 3) positive herds with data about rehydration; mw = 0.2-0.4, p > 0.05. total or oral rehydration rates did not differ by sf, but there was a tendency for forced rehydration to be more common for herds with sf iia than for herds with sf iid (median 5%, range 0-100% (n = 36) versus median 0%, range gp60, 60 kda glycoprotein. a a herd could be represented in more than one cell if analysis of multiple samples from that herd gave different results, e.g. two subtypes were present, or a subtype was identified in some samples but only subtype family in others. b novel subtypes. c genbank id for novel subtypes. d samples with undetermined species but cryptosporidium parvum subtypes are reported as c. parvum. 0-20% (n = 10)); mw = 1.8, p = 0.07. there were no observations on rehydration rates for the herds with mixed iia/iid sfs.the most prominent finding was that c. parvum is the dominant species in diarrhoeal calf samples from herds with calf diarrhoeal problems. the dominance of c. parvum in cryptosporidium-positive samples found here is in contrast to the results of our previous studies, where this species was only identified in 20% of samples from preweaned calves (silverlås, 2010) . however, that study material was based on a random selection of dairy herds in sweden, giving an estimate of species distribution in the average dairy herd and calf. in the current material, only diarrhoeal samples from herds with diarrhoeal problems were included, and species distribution was similar to what has been reported from other countries (santín et al., 2004; langkjaer et al., 2006; trotz-williams et al., 2006; plutzer and karanis, 2007; thompson et al., 2007) . the fact that c. parvum-infected calves were younger than c. bovis-infected calves indicates that in herds harbouring c. parvum this is the primary species infecting newborn calves, or that if infection occurs at approximately the same time in cryptospori-dium naïve calves, c. parvum will conquer c. bovis. cryptosporidium parvum was not identified by ssrrna sequencing after 42 days of age, and could only be detected as a minor species in older calves (up to 75 days of age) by ssrrna-rflp or gp60 analysis of c. bovis positive-samples. age can thus be used to estimate clinical relevance and it seems that cryptosporidium analysis is not relevant in diarrhoeal calves older than 6 weeks. the cut-off currently used is 2 months of age. in epidemiological studies, species determination is still an important tool, because species cannot be determined by microscopy and species distribution obviously differs with each study population.because c. parvum is pathogenic on its own, co-infection with other pathogens were only analysed at an individual level for calves infected with the considered apathogenic c. bovis. the presence of c. bovis without co-infection with other pathogens in six diarrhoeal samples indicates that this species also has pathogenic potential.''kalvpaketet'' analyses are primarily important to determine pathogen and tp statuses at herd level and thus multiple infections at herd level were investigated to see whether cryptosporidium infection alone was a common cause of diarrhoeal problems. the identification of up to four other pathogens in most herds with cryptosporidium infections confirms the complex aetiology of diarrhoeal disease, and this has to be taken into consideration when dealing with diarrhoeal problems. calves with a tp of p55 g/l are considered to have sufficient passive transfer (radostits, o.m., 2000 . the principles of control of infectious diseases of calves under 30 days of age. in: proceedings from the xxi world buiatrics congress in punta del este, uruguay, 4-8 december). our results thus indicate that failure of passive transfer could be a part of the herds' problems, because half of the calves and herds fell below that level.oocyst counts in individual samples taken at a single point in infection are affected by when in the course of infection a sample is taken, because excretion rates will follow a bell shaped curve over time (nydam et al., 2001) . however, when looking at a large sample size, these effects are hopefully distributed evenly in the material, and oocyst counts could provide a measure of pathogenicity (santín and trout, 2008) . indeed, c. parvum-positive samples had significantly higher oocyst counts than c. bovis-positive samples.the yellow faecal colour associated with c. parvum infection could reflect the time period when calves are infected -i.e. when milk is their dominant feed source, but yellow watery faeces has previously been associated with cryptosporidium infection (sanford and josephson, 1982) . faecal colour changes as the proportion of hay/silage and grain in the feed increases. thus brown or other colours than yellow would be more common in diarrhoeal samples from older calves, as was the case for c. bovis-positive samples.there are a high number of c. parvum subtypes, determined by differences in the gp60 gene, and new ones are frequently reported. in this study we identified 27 subtypes, of which 16 have not been reported previously. with three exceptions, only one subtype was present per herd. this indicates a stable within herd clonal pattern in the c. parvum population. similar patterns have been identified in areas with closed herd management (misic et al., 2006; thompson et al., 2007; brook et al., 2008; soba and logar, 2008) . in areas with animal exchange between herds, fewer subtypes but two or more subtypes per herd is a common pattern (peng et al., 2003; trotz-williams et al., 2006; brook et al., 2008) . sweden generally has closed herd management, with the exception of fattening herds where calves are bought from different herds from about 2 weeks of age. it is thus not surprising that one of the herds with two subtypes was a fattening herd. the identification of two subtypes in a dairy herd is, however, unexpected. if animal exchange occurs in dairy herds, moved animals are usually heifers or cows, where c. parvum infection is not likely to be present (silverlås et al., 2010a,b) . however, dairy herd size is increasing in sweden, and thus animal exchange is likely to increase, which could affect the subtype clonality of c. parvum in the future.the predominance of gp60 sf iia could reflect a higher pathogenicity or simply better host adaptation. in line with the results of this study, sf iia has been predominant in ruminants and humans in other studies from around the world (alves et al., 2003 (alves et al., , 2006 peng et al., 2003; wu et al., 2003; misic et al., 2006; trotz-williams et al., 2006; thompson et al., 2007; xiao et al., 2007; silverlås, 2010) . a difference in pathogenicity between sfs has been identified for cryptosporidium hominis, where sf id, but not sfs ia, ib or ie, was associated with diarrhoea . in the present study, c. parvum sf iia had a significant association with watery faeces compared with sf iid, there was also a tendency towards a higher oocyst count for sf iia.for the gp60 locus, no universal cryptosporidium primer (as for the ssrrna locus) exists, and the primers used to subtype c. parvum and c. hominis fails to replicate most other species. thus, the presence of c. parvum subtypes in five c. bovis samples indicated co-infection with c. parvum. this was investigated further by ssrrna-rflp of all c. bovis samples at the end of the study period. indeed, mixed infection was confirmed in these five samples as well as in two samples negative at the gp60 locus. interestingly, two of the mixed samples contained other subtypes (both new) than the c. parvum samples of those herds. this could indicate that c. bovis subtypes can sometimes be identified using the c. parvum/ c. hominis primers, as is the case for cryptosporidium meleagridis (glaberman et al., 2001; abe, 2010) .it could be argued that samples with mixed c. bovis/c. parvum should have been considered a separate group in our statistical analyses. they were put in the c. bovis group for three reasons. first, c. bovis was the dominant species as shown by ssrrna sequencing. second, it is not known whether c. bovis was a minor species in any of the c. parvum samples because rflp was not performed and thus the c. parvum group could include mixed samples as well. third, a subgroup analysis of age and oocyst counts showed that the mixed samples belonged to the c. bovis group (data not shown).our extended analysis method with concentration and cleaning of samples can detect oocysts at shedding rates of 50-100 opg (andersson, 2004 . cryptosporidium infection in cattle -evaluation of a new method for identification of subclinical infection. in swedish, english summary. master of veterinary medicine thesis. swedish university of agricultural sciences, uppsala sweden). the sensitivity of the method used in routine diagnostic procedures has not been established but our results show that it is less sensitive than our concentration method. in addition, the skills of the person performing the analysis will affect the result. at routine diagnostic services, several persons are involved in analysis, whereas in the extended analysis performed here, all samples were analysed by the same person, producing a more consistent result. these are the reasons why samples positive by routine diagnostic methods but negative after concentration and cleaning were considered false positives. however, the routine diagnostic method is obviously sensitive enough to evaluate clinically relevant samples.in conclusion, c. parvum is the dominant cryptosporidium sp.in diseased calves in diarrhoeal problem herds, in contrast to the average species distribution in swedish preweaned calves. thus, species determination does not need to be included in routine cryptosporidium diagnostic procedures in order to estimate the clinical relevance if this parasite genus is found in samples from diarrhoeal herds.the dominance of c. parvum, especially during the period when clinical cryptosporidiosis is most common, and higher oocyst counts, supports that this species is more pathogenic than c. bovis. however, the possible pathogenic potential of c. bovis warrants further attention. the age span when analysis for clinical cryptosporidiosis is performed could be shortened from 2 months to 6 weeks of age.the world health organization constantly monitors global influenza activity. it has noted global circulation of h1n1, h3n2, and two lineages of type b (victoriaand yamagata-) viruses that cause 670,000 annual deaths worldwide [1] . in the past few years, human infections with several subtypes of avian influenza virus (aiv) (e.g., h5 and h7) occurred sporadically [2] . highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) h5n1 and h5n6 viruses have infected 878 humans with 53% mortality since 1997 [3] . since the first case of human infection with low pathogenic avian influenza (lpai) h7n9 virus reported in china in 2013, the number of humans infected with this virus has dramatically increased to more than 1,567 as of april 2019 [4] . recognizing this public concern, it is important to distinguish seasonal influenza and avian influenza viruses such as h5 and h7n9 that occur simultaneously in humans, especially in china.vaccination and treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g., neuraminidase inhibitors (nais)) are primary interventions to prevent viral infections and their spread. however, vaccine production usually takes 6-12 months to prepare for newly emerging viruses. nais also should be taken within the first 48 h following an infection [5] . thus, rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral infections is important for mitigating the spread of virus within a community, facilitating immediate treatment with nais, and controlling carriers of these pathogens. methods to detect and identify influenza viruses have improved over the past decades, ranging from traditional virus culture [6] to introduction of serological and molecular diagnostic technology (e.g., real-time rt-pcr [7] and pcr [8] ) and more recently, rapid influenza detection tests (ridt) [9] [10] [11] . with various influenza-specific diagnostic tools, selecting the most appropriate approach is based on a number of factors, including sensitivity, specificity, throughput, cost, and availability [12] .virus isolation and serology method has traditionally been used to detect influenza virus. however, it may take several days to obtain results [13] . ridt is a rapid method of performing point-of-care testing (poct) in the field. most ridt diagnostic kits can detect influenza nucleoprotein antigen [14] . however, ridt has two potential limitations: i) relatively large numbers of influenza viruses must be present for accurate detection in the collected sample, and ii) inability to distinguish between influenza subtypes. overall, sensitivity and accuracy of ridt are lower than those of qrt-pcr-based methods that not only can amplify small amounts of target viral rna, but also can allow for determination of influenza a virus subtype using specifically designed primers [12] . despite qrt-pcr-based approaches have these advantages, they typically take at least a few hours up to 2 days to obtain results [15] . in addition, qrt-pcr needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing. these disadvantages limit its function in ensuring rapid prescription and administration of antiviral agents to patients. recently, many clinical laboratory improvement amendments (clia)-waived molecular tests have been approved for point-of-care use (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm). although the detection time (similar to ridt) and sensitivity (better than ridt) of clia-waived molecular tests have been improved, they are mostly limited to seasonal flu detection. they are incapable of discriminating seasonal influenza of avian subtypes that can cause human infection [16] .loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assays can amplify specific nucleic acids at a consistent temperature. they have been used for rapid detection of specific genes [17] [18] [19] [20] . in particular, lamp method combined with reverse transcription (called rt-lamp) is a method for simultaneously synthesizing cdna from template rna and amplifying dna [21] . thus, rt-lamp is useful for detecting rna viruses. in addition, polymerase enzyme produces protons and subsequently leads to decreased ph in the presence of extensive dna polymerase activity during lamp reaction, thus facilitating real-time and simple detection of amplicons as observed by a change from pink to yellow color in the reaction solution [22] . the specificity and sensitivity of rt-lamp are potentially comparable to those of existing pcr-based diagnostics with much shorter reaction time. recently, influenza diagnostics tools leveraging rt-lamp technology have been reported [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . however, most of these tools can only diagnose a single or a small number of human influenza viruses. their ability to diagnose newly emerging viruses is limited. none of these methods can simultaneously differentiate infection of seasonal influenza from multiple avian influenza virus infection including recently emerging h5nx and h7n9, although this is critical when infection by those viruses to humans simultaneously occurs.thus, the objective of this study was to develop a multiplex rt-lamp diagnostic method capable of simultaneously detecting human influenza viruses (two lineages of type b, h1n1 and h3n2) currently circulating in humans and avian influenza viruses (h5n1, h5n6 and h7n9) in rapidly emerging human infections. this assay also involves a one-pot colorimetric visualization approach that allows for direct observation by the naked eye. overall, this diagnostic assay may be useful as a rapid and highly sensitive poct that requires no laboratory equipment for field-based applications. to determine virus infectious titers, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (tcid 50 ) assay was performed in mdck cells. each virus was individually prepared by serial 10-fold dilutions in infection medium (minimal essential medium). the prepared virus diluent was used to infect mdck cells in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°c for 1 h in a co 2 incubator. supernatants were then replaced with infection medium (mem) with 1 μg/l l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone (tpck)-treated trypsin. after 2~3 days of incubation, virus titers were determined using the hemagglutination (ha) assay with 0.5% turkey or chicken red blood cells (rbcs). then 200 μl of virus stock was used to extract viral rna using rneasy mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. after extraction, rna was stored at − 80°c until use.more than 200 ha gene sequences of h1n1, h3n2, h5n1, h5n6, h5n8, and h7n9 with na gene sequences of influenza b viruses (both victoria and yamagata lineages) were downloaded from ncbi influenza virus resource database (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/genomes/flu) and analyzed with clc genomics workbench to identify highly conserved regions within similar subtypes distinct from other subtypes (fig. 1) . rt-lamp primer sets for each influenza subtype were designed using lamp primer design software (primer explorer v4). primer sets included two external primers (forward outer primer f3 and backward outer primer b3), two internal primers (forward inner primer fip and backward inner primer bip), and two loop primers (backward loop primer lb and forward loop primer lf) to augment the number of loops in the lamp reaction, thus enhancing its reaction speed. type b influenza-specific primers were designed to be specific for na gene based on consensus sequence identified in 200 sequences of its two lineages (victoria and yamagata). alternatively, influenza subtype-specific primers were designed to be specific to ha gene based on consensus sequences identified among 200 random sequences for each of h1n1, h3n2, h5n1, h5n6, h5n8, and h7n9 subtypes. all primers were synthesized by cosmogenetech (republic of korea). detailed information for all five primer sets used in this study is presented in table 1 .to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of rt-lamp detection, various primer concentrations (2.5 to 20 μm for external primer f3 and b3, 20 to 80 μm for internal primer fip and bip, and 5 to 20 μm for loop primer lf and lb) were used. for rt-lamp reactions, a master mix solution was prepared containing 5 μl of warm-start® colorimetric lamp 2x master mix (neb, uk), 1 μl of each f3 and b3 primer, 1 μl of each fip and bip primer, and 1 μl of each lf and lb primer for each reaction. optimized final concentration of each primer is presented in table 1 . then 2 μl of rna template extracted from virus was added to the master mix. the rt-lamp reaction was performed at 65°c for 60 min. it was then heated at 80°c for 10 min for enzyme inactivation in a heat block. positive rt-lamp reactions resulted in a color change of phenol red ph indicator from pink to yellow due to decreased ph in the presence of extensive dna polymerase activity. thus, results could be directly observed by naked eyes. rt-lamp results were also confirmed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.comparing sensitivities of multiplex rt-lamp, conventional one-step rt-pcr, and quantitative (q)rt-pcr to compare sensitivity of our multiplex rt-lamp assay to those of conventional one-step rt-pcr and qrt-pcr approaches, extracted rna samples were serially diluted 10-fold to 10 − 6 . then 2 μl of serially diluted rna was mixed with the optimized master mix and subjected to rt-lamp as described above. one-step rt-pcr was performed using 10 pmol of outer primers (f3 and b3) and equal amount of serially diluted rna template as used for rt-lamp with topscript™ one-step rt-pcr kit (enzynomics, republic of korea) under the following conditions: reverse transcription at 55°c for 30 min, initial denaturation at 95°c for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°c for 30s, annealing at 60°c for 30s, elongation at 72°c for 30s, and a final elongation step at 72°c for 5 min. qrt-pcr was performed using topreal™ one-step rtqpcr kit (sybr green, low rox) (enzynomics, republic of korea) with 10 pmol of outer primers (f3 and b3) and equal rna template as used for rt-lamp. pcr conditions were the same as those performed for the one-step rt-pcr described above using a real-time machine, cfx96 touchtm real-time pcr detection system (bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa). results of rt-lamp and one-step rt-pcr were visually confirmed using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.to determine the specificity of the optimized multiplex rt-lamp assay for targeting tested influenza viruses h12n5) were assessed using the multiplex rt-lamp assay described in this study. in addition, one-step rt-pcr or qrt-pcr was performed to confirm the presence of viral genomic rna using specific primer sets (additional file 1: table s1 ). one-step rt-pcr conditions were the same as described above. results of one-step rt-pcr were confirmed using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis.a total of 73 influenza-positive (confirmed using a qrt-pcr method) clinical nasopharyngeal aspirate samples collected from patients who demonstrated flu-like symptoms at chungbuk national university hospital, republic of korea were used for clinical evaluation of the rt-lamp diagnostic assay developed in this study. in addition, 18 spiked samples in which 10 4 tcid 50 /ml of viruses (i.e., h1n1, h5n6, h5n8, and h7n9) were diluted into flu-negative human nasopharyngeal aspirate samples following standardization and optimization, final concentrations of each primer set were fixed to be 5 μm for f3 and b3, 40 μm for fip and bip, and 10 μm for lf and lb for detecting type b and h3 subtypes, 5 μm for f3 and b3, 80 μm for fip and bip, and 10 μm for lf and lb for detecting the h1 subtype, and 5 μm for f3 and b3, 80 μm for fip and bip, 5 μm for lf and lb for detecting h5 and h7 subtypes (table 1) . targeted genes of specific subtypes were successfully amplified using these designed rt-lamp primers and observed by color changes within rt-lamp reaction tubes (fig. 2a) . a change in color from pink to light yellow indicated a positive reaction while negative reactions retained a pink color (fig. 2) . the specificity of these rt-lamp primers was additionally verified using mixed virus samples in various combinations. targeted genes in mixed virus samples were also specifically amplified by rt-lamp primers (fig. 2b ). in addition, agarose gel electrophoresis of rt-lamp products showed a typical ladder-like banding pattern (additional file 1: figure s1 ). these results indicate that multiplex rt-lamp primers described here can efficiently and specifically detect corresponding subtypes. they can also detect multiple human influenza virus genes as a universal element in this rt-lamp assay.to determine the detection limit of the multiplex rt-lamp assay for human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans, we performed amplification of endpoint-diluted viral rna extracted from each virus after propagation in 11-day-old chicken embryonic eggs for 48-72 h at 33°c for type b viruses and 37°c for type a viruses. rna of each virus was serially diluted (10-fold up to 10 − 6 ) in distilled water (dw). infectious viral particles were determined using tcid 50 / ml. infectious viral genome copies per microliter of extracted rna were estimated and presented in table 2 . table s1 for additional details of one-step rt-pcr primer sequences as shown in table 2 and additional file 1: figure s2 , the multiplex rt-lamp assay revealed a detection limit range of 0.1~100 viral genome copies (p < 0.05) for all human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans in our panel [i.e., type b (victoria-and yamagata-lineages), seasonal h1n1, h3n2, highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1, h5n6, and h5n8 isolated from human and avian species, and human h7n9 viruses]. on the other hand, the conventional one-step rt-pcr and real-time rt-pcr assays demonstrated detection limits ranging from 0.1~1,000 infectious viral genome copies for the same viral rna samples (table 2 and additional file 1: figure s2 ). total reaction and observation time of conventional pcr-based detection methods took 2~3 h while colorimetric visualization of multiplex rt-lamp assay results took only 1 h. overall, these results demonstrate that the multiplex rt-lamp assay developed in this study targeting ha or na gene of influenza viruses exhibits similar or higher sensitivity with reduced detection time compared to conventional pcr-based assays.we also examined the specificity of the multiplex rt-lamp assay using other subtypes of influenza (h2, h4, h6, h9, h10, h11, and h12) and other human infectious viruses obtained from a total of 44 clinical/spiked samples positive for hev, adv, piv, mpv, hbov, hrv, 229e, nl63, oc43, rsva, rsvb, and mers-cov that might potentially be in co-circulation with target viruses and cause similar symptoms. based on colorimetric assessments, the rt-lamp reaction using each primer set for h1, h3, h5, and h7, and type b viruses demonstrated no cross-reactivity with other influenza subtypes or human infectious viruses tested ( fig. 3 and table 3 ). conventional rt-pcr and qrt-pcr assays using specific primers (additional file 1: table s1 ) for other influenza subtypes and human infectious viruses were also performed to verify the presence of corresponding viral rna. target gene amplification was observed (fig. 3 and table 3 ). these results indicate that the rt-lamp assay can specifically detect influenza viruses tested in the current study.evaluation of the multiplex rt-lamp assay using clinical and spiked samples (table 4 ). in addition, 100% of h5n6, h5n8, and h7n9 samples were detectable using this developed rt-lamp assay. however, 83~100% of influenza viruses in clinical and spiked samples were detected using conventional rt-pcr, showing greater that 6% reduction in sensitivity compared to the rt-lamp assay (table 4 ). these results suggest that the multiplex rt-lamp diagnostic assay described in this study is as sensitive as qrt-pcr. however, it provides results more rapidly with greater simplicity. influenza virus, an acute respiratory infectious agent, can rapidly propagate in the upper respiratory tract. it is capable of airborne transmission to other individuals [33] . prescribing anti-influenza drugs following rapid and accurate diagnosis of an infection is thus critical to mitigate viral spread in the early stage of an outbreak. many primary care providers use ridt to diagnose influenza infections because it is simple to use with relatively rapid results. however, the accuracy of this approach is lower than that of qrt-pcr. a highly accurate gene-based diagnostic assay would serve as a valuable local on-site tool if it is easy to use with rapid results. although many cliawaived molecular tests satisfy these criteria due to recent advancement, most of these developed tests are limited to detect seasonal influenza without appropriate subtype discrimination. in this study, we developed a multiplex rt-lamp method to distinctively diagnose human influenza (e.g., seasonal influenza type b, h1n1, h3n2) and avian influenza viruses infecting humans (e.g., h5n1, h5n6, and h7n9). hence, this developed method would be essential in some countries where these viruses are cocirculating in humans. moreover, the rt-lamp method described here can be used to intuitively detect these viruses using a one-pot colorimetric visualization approach, making it a more feasible poct. our multiplex rt-lamp detection system was designed to be a more feasible ridt with accuracy as high as rt-pcr methods for detecting most recent human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans. although a variety of reliable and affordable rt-lamp methods have been developed to detect human or avian influenza viruses, each can only detect an individual subtype [23-29, 34, 35] or limited subtypes of human influenza viruses and/or avian influenza viruses infecting humans [18, 30, 36, 37] . in a pandemic, it is critical to rapidly differentiate patients infected by seasonal flu from those infected by an emerging strain. thus, reliable and affordable multiplex detection tools should be capable of identifying broadspectrum influenza viruses infecting humans. moreover, rt-lamp method for most recent emerging hpai h5n6 and h5n8 viruses which have high potential to infect humans has rarely been developed or evaluated for its detection efficacy. in addition to broad-spectrum detection of human influenza viruses using our multiplex rt-lamp assay, we optimized commercially available colorimetric rt-lamp enzyme. previous studies have also shown that the colorimetric visualization system using dyes (e.g., sybr) is detectable by naked eyes [38] . however, these colorimetric methods require additional steps (e.g., adding dye to test for color changes after reaction or the use of a uv device for visualization [39] ) that can decrease their utility in resource-limited primary care settings.rt-lamp assay is one of promising diagnostics tools that can be utilized to empower disease detection in developing countries as it does not require sophisticated, expensive equipment or trained personnel. the complex design of each specific primer sets made to amplify target sequence with high degree of sensitivity and specificity is one of major recognized constraints of this assay. recognizing its advantages when detecting rna genome of viral pathogens, rt-lamp assay still requires improvement, particularly for the rna extraction step, to be an efficient and suitable field-based diagnostic tool. current approaches for rna extraction of nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirate specimens collected from influenza-suspected patients usually require laboratory processing equipment (e.g., use of centrifuge system and others laboratory devices), technical support, and electricity. thus, the use of chaotropic salt extraction which does not require centrifugation [40] would improve the feasibility of the developed multiplex rt-lamp method as it utilizes a syringe with rna-binding filter method [41] . furthermore, it has been reported that the rt-lamp reaction could be performed without rna extraction step for some rna viruses [42] . although our multiplex rt-lamp assay has not been optimized to directly detect influenza viral rna without rna sample preparation, it would significantly increase its feasibility as a diagnostic tool for poct.although rt-lamp assays designed to detect victoria lineage type-b viruses has 10 times less sensitivity compared to one-step rt-pcr and qrt-pcr approaches, rt-lamp reactions for other subtypes exhibited similar or higher sensitivity without crossreaction to various human infectious viruses and other subtypes of avian influenza viruses. furthermore, our multiplex rt-lamp assay was more sensitive than a conventional rt-pcr approach using clinical or spiked samples. although the rt-lamp detection method for h7n9 was optimized and evaluated, single spiked sample for clinical verification would be a limitation of the method. the specificity of multiplex rt-lamp assay demonstrated in this current study might have limitations for use as a primary detection method based on local epidemiological setting. however, this assay's rapid detection has a valuable contribution by providing diagnostics specifically in areas with prevalent avian influenza viruses infecting humans.our multiplex rt-lamp method not only can minimize the use of expensive lab instruments and devices, but also can detect broad-spectrum human influenza viruses and avian influenza viruses infecting humans as accurately and more rapidly than conventional rt-pcr-based detection methods suitable for use in on-site testing. this method will improve and aid in the diagnosis of influenza infections and potentially increase the speed of clinicians to provide appropriate treatment.additional file 1 : figure s1 . specificity of rt-lamp. the specificity of the rt-lamp assay was tested using (a) individual and (b) mixed influenza virus samples listed below. rt-lamp amplicon was confirmed using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. the positive sample (yellow color) has a typical ladder-like pattern of rt-lamp reaction. figure s2 . sensitivity of the rt-lamp assay compared with conventional methods. to estimate the sensitivity of the rt-lamp assay, rna samples from each influenza viruses were 10-fold serially diluted and used as

(pdf 565 kb) the battles between humans and the pathogenic viruses are never ending. epidemic diseases, including zika (1), severe acute respitatory sundrome ( sars) (2) , and ebola (3), strike quickly, often killing hundreds of people during a single outbreak.on december 31, 2019, a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2), belonging to the orthocoronavirinae subfamily and distinct from middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)-cov and sars-cov, emerged in wuhan, china (4) (5) (6) . the rapid person-toperson spread of sars-cov-2, which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) , presents an imminent threat to public health and has caused a global health emergency (7) (8) (9) . the world health organization emergency committee declared this outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern" because of its 2.1% mortality rate and person-to-person transmission (10) . as of march 7, 2020, over 102,136 people have fallen ill with sars-cov-2, leading to 3,492 deaths in 93 countries, and the coronavirus continues to spread quickly all over the world.symptoms of covid-19 included fever, myalgia, and fatigue, as well as dry cough, shortness of breath, sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, sore throat, and diarrhea. lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels have also been observed in the patients with covid-19 (6) . a computed tomography (ct) can identify bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs (6, 8, (11) (12) (13) . despite the high infection and mortality rates, there is no specific cure for the disease because its pathogenesis remains unclear.the human adaptive immune system plays a critical role in defending against viral infections. many immune cells (such as leukocytes) and immune molecules (such as specific plasma proteins) are intrinsic components of blood. therefore, the functions of blood and the immune system are inseparable. t cells and b cells are important in the pathogenesis of many-perhaps all-immune-mediated diseases (14) (15) (16) (17) . a t cell receptor (tcr) mediates recognition of pathogen-associated epitopes through interactions with peptide and major histocompatibility complexes (pmhcs). tcrs and b cell receptors (bcrs) are generated by genomic rearrangement at the germline level, a process termed v(d)j recombination, which has the ability to generate marked diversity among tcrs and bcrs. parameterizing the elements of antigenspecific immune repertoires across a diverse set of epitopes may generate powerful applications in a variety of research fields for the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. here, we focus on insights into blood immune responses to 4 4 single-cell resolution.in this study, 16 participants were recruited from the sichuan province of china.the basic information and clinical features of the patients are listed in table s1 . the lung ct images of these subjects are shown in fig. s1 . there was one critical case (patient 1, male, 34 years old), one severe case (patient 2, male, 43 years old), and six moderate cases (patients 3-8) comprised of two males and four females aged 25-62 years old (table s1 ). the two cured patients (patient 9, male, 40 years old and patient 10, female, 20 years old) were on the discharged day from hospital after they tested negative for sars-cov-2 and the disease signs disappeared. three healthy people were included as normal controls (nc 1-3, table s1 ). in order to differentiate the covid-19 immune response from other infectious diseases, thereby identifying the unique covid-19 immune response, we also recruited one case of influenza a (patient 11), one case of acute pharyngitis (patient 12), and one case of cerebral infarction (patient 13) as controls (table s1 ).the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of each individual were isolated from the whole blood, and the single-cell mrna sequencing (scrna-seq) analysis of the pbmcs was performed on the 10 x genomics platform with chromium next gem single cell v(d)j reagent kits v1.1 (fig. 1a ). after quality control, we obtained 134,620 pbmc cells, 83,387 tcr clones, and 12,601 bcr clones from the 16 samples. in these samples, we identified 17 completely different pbmc cell types, which could be further divided into 56 cell subtypes according to marker genes of the 134,620 cells (fig. 1b, 1c, 1d and table s2 ). the 17 cell types included cd4+ t cells identified by ltb and il7r markers, cd8+ t cells identified by lef1 and cd8a, cd1c+_b dendritic cells identified by bset1 and cd1d, cd4+ cytotoxic t cells identified by cst7 and ccl4, cd8 cytotoxic t cells identified by cd3d and cd8a, and other cell types (fig. 1c, table s2 ). this suggests that human pbmcs have evolved highly differentiated cell subtypes to resist the invasion of pathogens (18) . there were three main states in the analysis process for reconstructing the developmental trajectories of the 56 cell subtypes, which showed a continuous trajectory of differentiating pbmcs (fig. 1e, fig. s2 ). in addition, 23 totally new candidate marker genes linked to 22 cell subtypes were identified (fig. s3) , suggesting potential roles for these newly discovered cell markers in the identification and functional study of these subtypes.to investigate the immune cell behaviors of the 56 cell subtypes in different all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in in the severe condition (patient 2), 18 signaling pathways were significantly changed in more than half of the cell subtypes compared to the normal controls.among these pathways, the most important was over-activation of the interferonrelated signaling pathways, including 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase and type i interferon signaling pathway(naive cd8+ t cells, cd4+ t cells, and other cells) and interferon alpha/beta/gamma signaling (naive cd8+ t cells, cd4+ t cells, and other cells) (fig. 2c , table s3 ). in other covid-19 conditions, the interferon signal was also over-activated to varying degrees. however, in the cured patients, the interferon signal was just mildly activated compared to the patients with severe and moderate conditions. in the cured condition, the signal pathway related to mrna translation of the virus was suppressed, while the signal pathway related to mapk was significantly enriched (fig. 2c , table s3-6). to detect whether these signaling pathway changes were specific to covid-19, we compared the covid-19 patients with the patients with influenza a (patient 11), acute pharyngitis (patient 12), and cerebral infarction (patient 13) and found that the signaling pathways were still enriched after filtering with these related disease controls (fig. s14 ). among these pathways, the interferon-mapk signaling pathway was the major blood immune response for covid-19infection.all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in the activation of the mapk signaling pathway by interferon involves a set of defense mechanisms evolved by human beings to fight against viral infections (19) (20) (21) .to further explore the expression differences of genes involved in different cell types in the various covid-19 conditions, we analyzed the gene expressions in patients with covid-19 and compared them to those of the controls (fig. 2g-j, fig. s7 ). first, we observed up-regulation expression of the interferon signal genes in the covid-19patients. among them, interferon α-inducible protein 27 (ifi27), originally known to involve in innate immunity and to intervene in cell proliferation (22) , was increasingly expressed in many cell types, including cd1c+_b dendritic cells, table s8 ). these genes were previously shown to regulate cell invasion, migration, proliferation and innate immunity by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production (27, 28) . in three groups of inpatients with different conditions, the up-regulated expression of these genes was observed in cd1c+_b dendritic cell, cd1c-cd141dendritic cell, cd141+clec9a+ dendritic cell, cd8 cytotoxic t cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. interestingly, in contrast to the three groups of inpatients, the expression pattern of these genes in the two cured patients was the opposite. in the cured patients, down-regulated expression was detected, indicating that the mapk signaling pathway was inhibited in these cells. these results indicate that downregulation of the mapk signal pathway may be one sign of patient recovery.to further explore the antibody clonal proliferation of tcr and bcr in covid-19, we conducted tcr and bcr v(d)j single cell transcriptome analysis. using integration analysis, we detected 83,387 tcr cell clones and 12,601 bcr clones in the 16 subjects (fig. 3a) . this result revealed the antibody repertoire in patients with all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in in the critical condition (patient 1), the fewest tcr clones (1,232) were detected, while, in the severe condition (patient 2), more tcr clones (7, 161) were detected. in one moderate patient (patient 8), the most tcr clones (20,370) were detected.according to these findings, the fewer the tcr clones, the more severe the covid-19 condition. the distribution of all tcr clones and the number of tcr clones of each patient are shown in fig. 3b and table s9 . using evolutionary analysis of the top tcr antibody sequences revealed by tcr sequencing, we found that tcrα sequences of cassegvgtpfdeqff (patient 2), casslglagdldeqff and casnqglaggrlyneqff (patient 4), cassqergvyneqff (patient 6) and cassevwasdheqyf (patient 10) were closely related (fig. s15) , suggesting that these antibody sequences may have a special activity for sars-cov-2 (and influenza a). compared to tcr, the number of bcr clones detected was much lower (fig. 3c , table s10 ). however, very strong bcr antibodies were not induced in most of the patients except in two moderate patients (patients 6 and 8).in one moderate patient (patient 9) (fig. 3d-g) , we detected 361 clones of cdr3 iglork/igh sequences of cqqygsspwtf/carvaesyydfwsakwegafdiw and 119 clones of cqqynsysf/carsgpitifgvvikgrggdafdiw (fig. 3c , table s10 ). in another moderate patient (patient 7), four high frequency clones were identified, including cqqyysipsltf/cathrtyfdwllpfdyw (179) (fig. 3c , table s10 ). these results suggest that the antibodies produced by patients 7 and 9 may have a sars-cov-2 specific affinity.we then analyzed top tcr encoded antibody sequences for known antigens, and some of them were annotated in the vdjdb antigen categories database (fig. 3h ). in patients with covid-19, we detected immune responses to known antigens, including epstein-barr virus (ebv), hiv-1, influenza a, yellow fever, and other rna viruses, as well as dna viruses such as cytomegalovirus (cmv). in addition, autoantigens were detected in the severe condition (patient 2) and the moderate condition (patients 4, 8, and 9). in patient 2, the autoantigen response was obvious activation, which indicated that this severe disease condition may be related to strong autoimmunity. on the contrary, in the critical condition (patient 1), only two antibodies against the ebola ebv antigen were detected. these results further suggest that the critical condition may be caused by insufficient immunity, while the severe condition may be aggravated by excessive autoimmunity. in the normal condition, no all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.

and nc 3; for the nc 2, two antigens were detected (hiv-1 and influenza a) (fig. 3h) . for the patient with influenza a (patient 11), the antigen and autoimmune responses of the yellow fever virus were detected. for the patient with acute pharyngitis (patient 12), ebv, hiv-1, influenza a and yellow fever virus antigens were detected, but there was no autoimmune response. for the patient with cerebral infarction (patient 13), no known antigens were detected. these results indicate that humans might use known immune recognition (mainly known rna viruses) to fight against sars-cov-2.type i interferon (ifn-i) is crucial for promoting antiviral defenses through the induction of antiviral effectors (29) . in this study, our single cell transcriptome results showed that irf27 was up-regulated 8.1 times more in critical patients, 51.7 times in severe patients, 39.9 times in moderate patients, 38.6 times in mild patients, and 29.5 times in cured patients compared to the normal controls (fig. 4a) . these results suggest that irf27 is a candidate marker gene for sars-cov-2 infection. bst2, which was previously shown to play a role in pre-b-cell growth (31) , also showed upexpression in covid-19 patients. consistent with our single cell transcription data, the expression profile of fos, which is a transcription factor mediating mapk pathway signaling, showed up-regulation in covid-19 patients but down-regulation in cured patients. this result suggests that fos is a candidate marker gene for cured covid-19 patients. we further performed pbmc immunofluorescence testing to compare the protein expressions of ifi27 between patients with covid-19 and controls. immunofluorescence staining showed that ifi27 was highly expressed in the whole lymphocyte of patients with covid-19, but only partially expressed on the lymphocyte of the controls (fig. 4b) .all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. perpetuity. preprint (which

https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 15.20033472 doi: medrxiv preprint in summary, we demonstrated that sars-cov-2 can enter the blood through the circulatory system and cause a blood immune response after infection through the respiratory system. therefore, in patients with covid-19, the damage is related to multiple organs (32) . the leukocyte immune responses involve many cell subtypes, including cd8+ t cells, cd8 cytotoxic t cells, cd4+ t cells, cd4+ cytotoxic t cells, cd1c+_b dendritic cells and other cell subtypes. after the virus reaches the blood immune cells, it might replicate-mainly in axl+siglec6+ dendritic cells, cd4+ t cells, and naive cd8+ t cells and might activate multiple cell subtypes of the interferon signal pathway to produce effectors, such as ifi27, ifitm1 and ifitm3, to fight the sars-cov-2 virus. the similar process also happened to influenza and west nile virus infection in human (23, 24) . through downstream activation of mapk, the expression of downstream effectors is activated by key transcription factors, such as fos, jun, and junb, which lead to a wide range of antiviral responses in the blood system (fig. 4c) . these results suggested that the immune response may come back the normal situation when the patients recovery, and the mapk signal is thus inhibited.in conclusion, in this study, we revealed the immune response process of sars-cov-2 entering the blood circulation system using immune profiling analysis with single-cell resolution. in the critical condition, the number of different cell types, expressed genes, and tcr/bcr responses indicated a relationship between the critical nature of the patient's condition and his immunodeficiency. on the contrary, the severe condition was shown to be related to a strong autoimmune response and over-activated interferon pathway. these results suggested that immune deficiency or immune over-reacts may make patients with covid-19 go to worse condition because of their imbalance adaptive immune response (33) (34) (35) . our study also shows that the activation of the interferon-mapk signaling pathway and tcr-and bcrproduced antibodies play key roles in combating sars-cov-2 infection. these results will provide important information for covid-19 treatment and drug development.all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission. perpetuity. preprint (which

medrxiv preprint in dairy cattle, diarrhea is considered one of the most common syndromes in neonates, resulting in high morbidity and mortality during the first 4 weeks of life (uetake, 2013) . neonatal diarrhea is primarily caused by the four most prevalent enteropathogens in calves including rotavirus, coronavirus, escherichia coli k99, and cryptosporidium spp. (meganck et al., 2014) . mono-infections with one pathogen or co-infections with two or more pathogens are commonly seen (brar et al., 2017; cai et al., 2017) . among them, cryptosporidium spp. and rotavirus are most frequently identified in fecal specimens from neonatal calves all over the world (cho et al., 2013; al mawly et al., 2015; mohamed et al., 2017) .cryptosporidium spp. are important protozoan parasites that infect a wide variety of vertebrates including humans and farm animals (feng et al., 2018) . the association of cryptosporidium infection with bovine diarrhea was first reported in 1978 (pohlenz et al., 1978) . this was followed by direct demonstration of the occurrence of diarrhea in experimentally infected calves (tzipori et al., 1983) . since then, cryptosporidiosis has been https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.02.006 0020-7519/ó 2019 australian society for parasitology. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. considered one of the most important causes of diarrhea and enteritis in neonatal calves globally (blanchard, 2012; cho and yoon, 2014; wang et al., 2017) . recently, several cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been reported in neonatal calves in australia, estonia, india and china, resulting in high mortality and substantial economic losses (izzo et al., 2011; randhawa et al., 2012; cui et al., 2014; brar et al., 2017; niine et al., 2018) .four cryptosporidium spp. including cryptosporidium parvum, cryptosporidium bovis, cryptosporidium ryanae and cryptosporidium andersoni are responsible for the majority of cryptosporidium infections in cattle, with c. parvum dominating in pre-weaned calves, c. bovis and c. ryanae in post-weaned calves, and c. andersoni in adult cattle in most areas (xiao, 2010) . among them, c. parvum accounts for over 90% of cryptosporidium infections in neonatal calves, and is the only major pathogenic and zoonotic species in dairy cattle (thomson et al., 2017) . the pathogenicity of c. bovis and c. ryanae in post-weaned calves has not been established (thomson et al., 2017) .within c. parvum, many subtypes exist based on sequence characterizations of the 60 kda glycoprotein (gp60) gene. among them, calves in most industrialised countries are commonly infected with iia subtypes, especially subtype iiaa15g2r1 (xiao, 2010) . in addition, iid subtypes have been identified in dairy calves in some countries such as sweden, turkey, romania and egypt (bjorkman et al., 2015; vieira et al., 2015; ibrahim et al., 2016; taylan-ozkan et al., 2016) . in contrast, pre-weaned dairy calves in china are commonly infected with c. bovis, and when they are infected with c. parvum, almost exclusively with iid subtypes, especially iida15g1 and iida19g1 in 2016, a diarrhea outbreak was identified in neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in jiangsu province, china. approximately 60% of neonatal calves on this farm died due to severe watery diarrhea. this study aims to explore causes of the diarrhea outbreak, as well as the pathogenicity of the three most common cryptosporidium spp. in dairy calves.fecal specimens from dairy cattle in this study were collected with the permission of the farm manager, and the cattle were handled in accordance with the animal ethics procedures and guidelines of the people's republic of china. the research protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the south china agricultural university.this study took place on a large dairy farm in jiangsu province in east china. there were approximately 5500 dairy cattle including $600 neonatal calves on this farm. the majority of animals on the farm were of the holstein breed, with fewer than 50 of the jersey breed. from january to april in 2016, a diarrhea outbreak in neonatal dairy calves was noticed on the study farm, with watery diarrhea occurring in over 400 pre-weaned calves (fig. 1a) . approximately 360 calves died at 10-20 days of age despite being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. to identify the cause of the outbreak, fecal specimens were collected from 18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak in april 2016 (table 1) .to further investigate the transmission and pathogenicity of cryptosporidium spp. after the outbreak, 1372 fecal specimens were collected from pre-weaned (<3 months), post-weaned (3-12 months), and adult (>24 months) dairy cattle on the farm in may 2016 (n = 356), august 2016 (n = 512), june 2017 (n = 304), and november 2017 (n = 200) ( table 2) . fecal specimens were divided into three groups: formed feces from animals with no diarrhea (n = 1126), loose feces from animals with moderate diarrhea (n = 149), and liquid feces from animals with watery diarrhea (n = 97). feces were collected directly from the rectum of each cattle, using disposable gloves, into 50 ml centrifuge tubes. approximately 1 g of each fecal specimen was transferred into a 1.5 ml tube and kept frozen at à80°c, while the remaining feces were stored in 2.5% potassium dichromate at 4°c.to perform a preliminary diagnosis of the cause of the calf diarrhea, fecal specimens of 18 seriously ill calves submitted by the farmer were tested by enzymatic immunoassay (eia) for the four most common enteric pathogens in cattle. in this, 200 mg of frozen fecal specimen were tested for rotavirus, coronavirus, escherichia coli k99, and cryptosporidium spp. by using the pathasure enteritis eia kit (biovet, saint-hyacinthe, canada). in addition, rotavirus in 418 fecal specimens collected after the diarrhea outbreak from both pre-weaned (n = 212) and post-weaned (n = 206) calves was tested using the prospect rotavirus kit (thermo-oxoid, basingstoke, uk). for all 1390 fecal specimens preserved in potassium dichromate, including the 18 specimens collected during the outbreak, 200 mg of feces were washed three times with distilled water by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min. genomic dna was extracted from the washed specimens by using the fastdna spin kit for soil (mp biomedicals, ca, usa), and stored at à80°c until being analysed by pcr.cryptosporidium spp. in the specimens were detected by nested pcr amplification of a $830 bp fragment of the ssrrna gene, and were genotyped by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the secondary pcr products, using restriction enzymes sspi and mboii (new england biolabs, ma, usa) (feng et al., 2007) . to identify the c. parvum subtype involved, a $850 bp fragment of the gp60 gene was amplified by nested pcr (feng et al., 2009) . each specimen was analysed twice by pcr at each genetic locus. reagent-grade water was used as the negative control, whereas cryptosporidium canis dna was used as the positive control for the ssrrna pcr and cryptosporidium hominis dna as the positive control for the gp60 pcr.representative positive pcr products of the ssrrna gene, including at least two of each cryptosporidium spp. identified, were sequenced to confirm the rflp results. for subtyping of c. parvum, all positive pcr products of the gp60 gene were sequenced. pcr products were sequenced in both directions on an abi 3730 genetic analyzer (applied biosystems, ca, usa). the sequences obtained were assembled using chromaspro (http://www.technelysium.com.au/chromaspro.html), edited using bioedit (http:// www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html), and aligned with reference sequences in the genbank database using clustalx (http://clustal.org/) to determine cryptosporidium spp. and subtypes. table 1

using the software package r version 3.5.0 (https://www.r-project.org/). the v 2 test was used to compare differences in cryptosporidium or rotavirus infection rates between age groups or animals with or without diarrhea. to conduct a risk factor analysis, animals meeting the criteria of moderate or watery diarrhea were considered as cases of diarrhea. logistic regression was used to assess the association between putative risk factors and the occurrence of diarrhea, using data from 886 calves of 0-6 months in age after the diarrhea outbreak. initially, the strength of association was assessed using a univariate model at the liberal p 0.2. variables significant at p 0.2 were thereafter used to build a multivariate model, with p < 0.05 being considered significant in the final model. odds ratios (or) with 95% confidence intervals (ci) were used to identify risk factors for diarrhea occurrence in calves.in the initial eia diagnosis of major enteric pathogens in 18 specimens from seriously ill calves (fig. 1a) , we found that 13 were positive for cryptosporidium spp., eight for rotavirus, and all negative for coronavirus or e. coli k99 (table 1) . these 18 specimens were further analysed for cryptosporidium spp. by the ssrrnabased pcr, which led to the identification of c. parvum in 15 of them including all 13 eia positive specimens. fourteen of the c. parvum-positive specimens were successfully subtyped as iida19g1 by sequence analysis of the gp60 gene.among the 1372 fecal specimens collected from calves after the diarrhea outbreak, 418 were tested for rotavirus by eia. altogether, 38/212 (17.9%) specimens from pre-weaned calves were positive, while 6/206 (2.9%) specimens from post-weaned calves were positive. the infection rate of rotavirus in pre-weaned calves was highest (33.9%) at 1 week of age, decreased afterwards in calves of 2-5 weeks of age, and mostly remained zero in calves older than 6 weeks (fig. 1b) . in pre-weaned calves, the highest infection rate for rotavirus occurred in calves with watery diarrhea (28.0%), followed by those without diarrhea (17.6%) and with moderate diarrhea (10.0%). in post-weaned calves, infection with rotavirus was similar among animals with watery diarrhea (2.6%), moderate diarrhea (3.1%) and no diarrhea (2.9%). pairwise v 2 analysis showed that none of the differences between any two of the symptom groups of pre-and post-weaned calves reached significance (p > 0.05; table 3 ).of the 1372 fecal specimens collected after the diarrhea outbreak, 195 (14.2%) were positive for cryptosporidium spp. by pcr analysis of the ssrrna gene ( table 2 ). the highest infection rate was 22.7% (139/612) in pre-weaned calves, followed by postweaned calves (8.4%; 43/514) and adult cattle (1.0%, 2/195) ( table 2 ). pairwise v 2 analysis among the three age groups all showed highly significant differences in infection rates (p < 0.001). in pre-weaned calves, the infection rate for cryptosporidium spp. in april 2016 (83.3%) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in may 2016 (21.7%), august 2016 (53.3%), june 2017 (28.2%), and november 2017 (17.6%) ( fig. 2a) . odds of cryptosporidium infection in calves during the diarrhea outbreak were 4.4-23.5 times higher than after the outbreak. the same trend was also observed in the occurrence of c. parvum; 83.3%, 3.7%, 46.7%, 22.5% and 16.5% of specimens were positive in april 2016, may 2016, august 2016, june 2017, and november 2017, respectively ( fig. 2a) . the occurrence of c. parvum infection during the outbreak was also significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared with after the outbreak, with or = 5.7-129.6.3.4. distribution of cryptosporidium spp./subtypes after the outbreak rflp analysis was successful for all 195 ssrrna pcr-positive specimens, allowing the identification of four cryptosporidium spp. in dairy cattle. overall, c. parvum was the most frequently identified species (n = 79), followed by c. ryanae (n = 48), c. bovis (n = 31) and c. andersoni (n = 3). concurrent infections with mixed cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 34 cattle and included c. ryanae/c. bovis (n = 26) and c. parvum/c. bovis (n = 8) ( table 2) .in dna sequence analysis, the representative ssrrna sequences generated from specimens of c. parvum (n = 6), c. ryanae (n = 1), c. bovis (n = 1) and c. andersoni (n = 1) were identical to the genbank reference sequences kp793008, kp793012, kp793007 and km110052, respectively. for the c. parvum-positive specimens, 77/87 specimens were successfully subtyped at the gp60 locus, and the sequences obtained were all identical to the reference sequence hq009809 of the subtype iida19g1 in genbank. in pre-weaned calves, infection rates for cryptosporidium spp. varied greatly by age in weeks (fig. 2b) . the highest infection rate was 51.0% (26/51) at 3 weeks of age, whereas the lowest infection rate (0 or 0/34) was at 5 weeks of age. during the first 3 weeks, 73/79 cryptosporidium-positive calves were infected with c. parvum (fig. 2c) . afterwards, c. parvum disappeared in pre-weaned calves. in contrast, c. ryanae and c. bovis became the only two species identified in calves of 4-12 weeks of age, and co-infection with the two species was commonly seen in these animals.in post-weaned calves, cryptosporidium infection rates varied from 0 to 35.4% at 3-12 months of age (fig. 3a) . the infection rate was highest at 3 months of age, decreased to lower than 10% in calves of 4-6 months of age, and remained mostly near zero in calves older than 6 months. cryptosporidium ryanae was the most common species identified in the 3-6 months age groups (fig. 3b) . cryptosporidium bovis, the second most common species in post-weaned calves, was frequently seen in mixed infections with c. ryanae or c. parvum. in contrast to preweaned calves, c. parvum was rarely detected in post-weaned calves, being identified in only two calves. thus, c. parvum was much less prevalent in post-weaned calves (0.4%) than in preweaned calves (11.9%; v 2 = 59.831, p = 0.000). in addition, c.andersoni was detected in two calves of 12 months of age and one adult animal. in pre-weaned calves, cryptosporidium infection rates in calves with moderate diarrhea (34.7%) or watery diarrhea (34.4%) were significantly higher than in calves without diarrhea (18.4%; p < 0.01) (tables 2 and 3 ). for c. parvum, the infection rate in calves with watery diarrhea (26.2%) was higher than in calves with moderate diarrhea (10.9%) or no diarrhea (10.2%). the difference in infection rates for c. parvum was highly significant between calves with watery diarrhea and no diarrhea (v 2 = 12.911, p = 0.000). unlike c. parvum, the c. ryanae infection rate in calves with moderate diarrhea (8.9%) was significantly higher than that in calves without diarrhea (3.1%; v 2 = 6.937, p = 0.008). in contrast, the presence of c. bovis was similar between calves with moderate diarrhea (6.9%) and no diarrhea (3.3%; p = 0.095).in post-weaned calves, the highest cryptosporidium infection rate was observed in calves with moderate diarrhea (19.6%), followed by those with watery diarrhea (17.2%) and no diarrhea (6.6%) ( table 2 ). the difference in cryptosporidium infection rates was highly significant between calves with moderate diarrhea and no diarrhea (v 2 = 7.972, p = 0.002) ( table 3) . among cryptosporidium spp., only c. ryanae had sufficient positive specimens to perform the correlation analysis on occurrence of diarrhea, showing that the infection rate in animals with moderate diarrhea (8.7%) was significantly higher than those without diarrhea (2.3%; v 2 = 4.042, p = 0.013).in the univariate analysis of risk factors associated with the occurrence of diarrhea in calves of 0-6 months of age after the diar-rhea outbreak, cryptosporidium-positive animals had a significantly higher chance of having diarrhea (p = 0.000; table 4 ), especially moderate diarrhea (p = 0.002). among cryptosporidium spp., c. parvum infection (p = 0.004) was a risk factor for the occurrence of watery diarrhea, while c. ryanae (p = 0.000) or c. bovis (p = 0.001) infection was a risk factor for the occurrence of moderate diarrhea. surprisingly, we found no evidence showing age as a significant risk factor for the occurrence of diarrhea in pre-and post-weaned calves in this investigation (p = 0.779). further analysis using the multivariate model showed that the association of c. ryanae or c. bovis infection and the occurrence of moderate diarrhea was just below statistical significance (p = 0.055 and 0.062, respectively; table 4 ).we identified cryptosporidiosis as the likely cause for the outbreak of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves described in this study. this was largely based on results of the initial eia test, which identified the presence of c. parvum and rotavirus in the 18 seriously ill calves examined during the outbreak. two other common enteropathogens for neonatal calf diarrhea, coronavirus and e. coli k99, were ruled out as the cause of the diarrhea. the role of rotavirus in the occurrence of the diarrhea outbreak appears to be small, as only fewer than half of the seriously ill calves had the infection and rotavirus infection was not significantly associated with the occurrence of moderate or watery diarrhea in calves during post-outbreak investigation. this was further supported by the peak occurrence of rotavirus infection in calves at 1 week of age, which is slightly earlier than the age range (10-20 days) of ill calves during the outbreak. the identification of cryptosporidiosis as the cause of the diarrhea outbreak was substantiated by genotyping of cryptosporidium spp. in calves. all cryptosporidiumpositive ill calves had c. parvum instead of c. bovis, which is the table 4 association between cryptosporidium spp. and occurrence of diarrhea in dairy calves after a diarrhea outbreak on a farm in jiangsu, china, as indicated by results of univariate and multivariate analyses. dominant cryptosporidium sp. in pre-weaned calves in china but mostly avirulent . in addition, the occurrence of c. parvum in pre-weaned calves was significantly higher during the outbreak than after the outbreak (or = 5.7-129.6), and c. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves in a post-outbreak investigation. nevertheless, rotavirus could have played a secondary role in the outbreak of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned dairy calves on the farm, as suggested by investigations of outbreaks of calf diarrhea in australia and india (izzo et al., 2011; brar et al., 2017) . in this study, pathological investigations were not conducted on dead calves due to the distant nature of the farm from research facilities. we became involved with the investigation when the outbreak was nearing the end, and the fecal specimens from the 18 seriously ill calves were received by express mail. compared with numerous reports of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in humans, only a limited number of outbreaks have been documented in dairy calves (reynolds et al., 1986; aurich et al., 1990; xiao et al., 1993) . in these earlier studies, the detection of cryptosporidium infections was based on microscopy or an eia test. although the species involved was unknown, it was reasonable to assume that these outbreaks were caused by c. parvum, which is well known to cause watery diarrhea (meganck et al., 2014) . in one recent study in estonia, however, the c. parvum subtype iiaa18g1r1 was identified as the cause of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in pre-weaned dairy calves (niine et al., 2018) . similarly in china, the only reported bovine cryptosporidiosis outbreak was caused by the c. parvum subtype iida15g1 (cui et al., 2014) . that outbreak occurred on a dairy farm in ningxia, northwestern china, leading to the death of 356 calves. unlike the finding in ningxia, the bovine cryptosporidiosis outbreak reported in the present study was caused by the c. parvum subtype iida19g1. although c. parvum is still an emerging cryptosporidium sp. in dairy cattle in china, iida15g1 and iida19g1 subtypes are dominant c. parvum subtypes in pre-weaned dairy calves wang et al., 2017) .in this study, we also examined the transmission characteristics of cryptosporidium spp. on this large dairy farm after the diarrhea outbreak. the overall infection rate of cryptosporidium spp. was 14.2%, which is similar to the average prevalence rate (14.0%) in dairy cattle in china . as in most previous studies in china and elsewhere (fayer et al., 2010; venu et al., 2013; wang et al., 2017) , declining infection rates with increased age was also observed in the present study, with the infection rate in pre-weaned calves (22.7%) significantly higher than those in post-weaned calves (8.4%) and adult cattle (1.0%). among the four cryptosporidium spp. identified on the farm in the present study, c. parvum was the most frequently detected species in pre-weaned calves, c. ryanae and c. bovis were dominant in post-weaned calves, whereas c. andersoni was only identified in three older animals. this is largely in agreement with the age-related distribution of cryptosporidium spp. in dairy cattle elsewhere in the world (xiao, 2010) . however, as in some locations of china (cai et al., 2017; wang et al., 2017) , c. bovis and c. ryanae were also common in pre-weaned dairy cattle. in fact, c. ryanae was not only the most common species identified in post-weaned calves, but also more prevalent than c. bovis in pre-weaned calves in the present study. due to the high infection rates of both c. bovis and c. ryanae, a high rate of co-infections with the two cryptosporidium spp. was also observed in this study.as expected, cryptosporidium infection was significantly associated with the occurrence of calf diarrhea in the post-outbreak investigation (cho et al., 2013; meganck et al., 2014) . in preweaned calves, the cryptosporidium infection rate, especially the one for c. parvum, was significantly higher in animals with watery diarrhea than in those with moderate or no diarrhea in v 2 analysis.similar observations were also seen in dairy calves in numerous earlier studies (aita et al., 2015; cai et al., 2017) . however, there was also an association between c. ryanae infection and the occurrence of moderate diarrhea in pre-weaned calves. this was also the case with co-infections of c. ryanae and c. bovis. the association between c. ryanae infection and the occurrence of moderate diarrhea was also seen in post-weaned calves. this is contrary to the findings elsewhere that c. ryanae has not yet been associated with any clinical signs in infected calves .the pathogenicity of c. parvum and c. ryanae observed in this study was supported by results of the logistic regression analysis. cryptosporidium parvum infection was significantly associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in a univariate analysis, whereas c. ryanae or c. bovis infection was associated with the occurrence of moderate diarrhea. previously, the pathogenic potential of c. bovis was suggested in some earlier reports based on its detection in preweaned calves with diarrhea (silverlas and blanco-penedo, 2013; lee et al., 2016) . the present study represents, to our knowledge, the first description of such an association through statistical analysis of epidemiological data.in conclusion, we report a cryptosporidiosis outbreak caused by c. parvum subtype iida19g1 in neonatal calves with significant mortality on a large dairy farm in jiangsu, china. this serves as new evidence of the virulence of this emerging subtype in the country. in addition, c. ryanae and c. bovis have been shown as potential causes for moderate diarrhea in dairy calves. the emerging nature of c. parvum in farm animals in china, the high mortality in this outbreak, and a lack of effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis highlight the need to develop control measures against the transmission of c. parvum on dairy farms.canine coronavirus (ccov) is an enveloped rna virus, responsible for gastrointestinal infection in dogs. to date, two different ccov genotypes have been recognized, ccov type i and ccov type ii. recently, ccov type ii strains of potential recombinant origin with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) were detected and characterized as a new subtype (ccov-iib) of canine coronavirus, in order to be differentiated from the ''classical'' ccov type ii strains (ccov-iia). in the present study, two ccov-iib strains were detected in the faeces and internal organs of two puppies, which died after presenting gastrointestinal symptoms. mixed infection of both subtypes (ccov-iia/iib) was detected in the faeces, while only ccov-iib was detected in the organs. puppies were also infected by canine parvovirus type 2 (cpv-2). both ccov-iib strains were isolated on cell cultures and subjected to sequence analysis and phylogeny. by means of rt-pcr and real time rt-pcr assays, tissue distribution and quantitation of viral loads took place. these cases represent the first description of tissue distribution and quantitation of ccov-iib strains, detected in the organs. the detection of ccov-iia strains, which is restricted to the faeces, suggests that ccov-iib strains may have an advantage in disseminating throughout a dog with cpv-2 coinfection, in contrast to common enteric ccov-iia strains.ß 2011 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved. (decaro and buonavoglia, 2008) . moreover, in 2009, tgevlike ccovs of potential recombinant origin were identified and characterized as a new ccov subtype (ccov-iib) (decaro et al., 2009 (decaro et al., , 2010 erles and brownlie, 2009) . ccov is the causative agent of gastroenteritis in dogs, characterized by high morbidity and low mortality. clinical signs include anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, mild to severe diarrhoea (usually lasting 1-2 weeks) and occasionally death, mainly in puppies. the disease is more severe in young animals (carmichael and binn, 1981) . systemic infections are not usual; however, during the past few years, there have been reports of fatal disease, with ccov strains detected in the enteric tract, as well as in the organs (buonavoglia et al., 2006; decaro et al., 2009) .in 2010, ccov identification, molecular characterization and sequence analysis took place for the first time in greece, regarding common enteric ccov-ii strains detected in a severe outbreak of diarrhoea in a kennel (ntafis et al., 2010) . in the current study we report the quantitation and molecular characterization of two tgevlike ccov strains, detected in the organs of two puppies displaying fatal enteritis.during summer of 2009, two dead dogs were submitted for laboratory investigation. the dogs were coming from two different pet shops of thessaloniki, a city of northern greece. both dogs, a 6-week-old yorkshire terrier (66/09) and a 16-week-old pomeranian (68/09), presented fever, lethargy, inappetence, severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea and vomiting leading to death, 2 days after the onset of the symptoms. the first puppy was vaccinated with a single dose of a polyvalent vaccine against all major infectious diseases (canine distemper, infectious hepatitis, parvoviral enteritis, parainfluenza and leptospirosis) 2 weeks before the symptoms, while the second one, had never been vaccinated.necropsy examination of both dogs revealed linear haemorrhages of the intestinal wall, haemorrhagic enteritis and ulcerated duodenum. sero-sanguineous fluid was observed in the abdominal cavity of the pomeranian. lungs of both puppies were congested with multiple areas of emphysema. no lesions were observed at the heart. liver of both puppies appeared enlarged, friable and yellow-brown in color with multifocal discolorated spots. congested vessels in the dura mater of the brain were also observed.samples from the faeces and the parenchymatous organs were subjected to virological investigations, using methods previously described, regarding common canine viral pathogens e.g., canine parvovirus type 2 (cpv-2) (pcr and real time pcr) (decaro et al., 2005a (decaro et al., , 2006a , canine distemper virus (cdv) (rt-pcr) (frisk et al., 1999) , canine adenovirus type 1 and type 2 (cav-1 and cav-2) (pcr) (hu et al., 2001) and ccov (rt-pcr) (pratelli et al., 1999) .for virus isolation, a-72 cell line (canine fibrosarcoma) was used. the cells were grown in dulbecco-minimum essential medium (d-mem) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (fbs). faecal and tissue samples were homogenized (10%, w/v) in d-mem and centrifuged at 8000 â g for 10 min. supernatants were treated with antibiotics (1000 iu/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin) for 30 min, inoculated on partially confluent a72 cell cultures and then, they were incubated at 37 8c in a 5% co 2 incubator. after an adsorption period of 30 min, d-mem was added. cells were daily observed for cytopathic effect (cpe) of ccov for 5 days. an immunofluorescence (if) assay was used for the detection of ccov at the infected cells. for the if assay a 1:100 dilution of cat polyclonal serum specific for alphacoronavirus-1 and a 1:100 dilution of goat anti-cat igg conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (sigma-aldrich, usa). each sample was considered negative after 3 passages.rna was extracted from faecal and organ samples of both dogs using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit and the rneasy mini kit (qiagen gmbh, hilden, germany), respectively. for ccov type i and ii detection and quantitation in faecal and organ samples, two real time rt-pcr assays with the same sensitivity were used (decaro et al., 2005b) . reverse transcription was performed using geneamp 1 rna pcr (applied biosystems, italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions.for the discrimination of classical (subtype iia) and tgev-like (subtype iib) ccovs, two rt-pcr assays with comparable levels of sensitivity were performed, as previously described (decaro et al., 2010) . rt-pcrs with primers 20179/ins-r (ccov-iia) or 20179/174-268 (ccov-iib) were conducted using superscript one-step rt-pcr for long templates (invitrogen s.r.l.). in order to verify the absence of tgev strains in the samples that were positive by ccov-iib specific assay, an rt-pcr, able to discriminate ccov and tgev according to the amplicon size was used (wesley, 1999) .the 3 0 end of the genome of the ccov-iib strains was amplified as previously described, using viral rna extracted from the lungs, superscript one-step rt-pcr for long templates (invitrogen s.r.l.) and six pairs of primers, specific for overlapping fragments, encompassing orfs 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4, 5, 6, 7a and 7b (decaro et al., 2007) . the nucleotide sequences were determined in both directions by a commercial facility (beckman coulter genomics, united kingdom). sequence assembling and analysis were carried out using the bioedit software package (hall, 1999) and the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and european molecular biology laboratory (embl; http://www.ebi.ac.uk) analysis tools. phylogenetic analysis was conducted using mega4 program (tamura et al., 2007) . phylogenetic trees, based on the amino acid sequences of s, e, m and n proteins, were elaborated using neighbor-joining method, supplying a statistical support with bootstrapping over 1000 replicates. simplot was used for nucleotide sequence comparison of the two strains to alphacoronavirus-1 reference strains (lole et al., 1999) . the sequences of strains 66/09 and 68/09 were registered in genbank under the accession numbers hq450376 and hq450377, respectively.by means of nested pcr assay for ccov, viral rna was detected in faeces, lungs, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, heart, and liver of both puppies. in addition, the brain of the pomeranian (68/09) was tested positive, while the brain of the yorkshire terrier (66/09) was tested negative. by genotype specific real time rt-pcr assays, only ccov-ii was detected in all positive samples. ccov-ii rna copies/ ml of template in the samples are shown in table 1 .in the faecal samples of the two puppies, both ccov-ii subtypes were detected, while in the organs which tested positive, only ccov which was characterized as tgev-like (ccov-iib) was detected. no tgev strains were detected in the samples.the ccov-iib strains (66/09 and 68/09) were isolated from the lung homogenates of both puppies. a-72 cells developed a cytopathic effect that consisted of cell rounding and lysis of the monolayer. in addition, cells were tested positive by the immunofluorescence assay. viral titres on cell cultures were 10 4.25 (66/09) and 10 4 tcid 50 /50 ml (68/09) at the 3rd passage.both puppies were tested positive for cpv-2a field strains and negative for cdv, cav-1 and cav-2.a total of 8822 and 8828 nucleotides were determined for strains 66/09 and 68/09, respectively, encompassing orfs 2 (s protein), 3a, 3b, 3c, 4 (e protein), 5 (m protein), 6 (n protein), 7a and 7b. alignment of the sequences with tgev, ccov and fcov reference strains available in genbank showed the highest identity to ccov-iib reference strain 119/08 (eu924791) (98.2% and 98.9% for 66/09 and 68/09, respectively). the two greek strains shared an identity of 98%.the spike protein gene of both strains was 4374 nucleotides long, encoding a protein of 1457 amino acids. when compared to four tgev-like reference strains (430/ 07, 119/08, 174/06 and 341/05), no insertions or deletions were observed. the two strains shared 97.6% aa identity to each other, while they showed the highest aa identity to ccov-iib reference strain 119/08 (98.3%). by simplot analysis, the two strains displayed higher nucleotide conservation with the tgev strain purdue than with the pantropic ccov-iia strain cb/05, at the 5 0 -end of the s gene (fig. 1) . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two greek strains were more closely related to the four ccov-iib reference strains detected in dogs' organs (fig. 2a) .the envelope protein was found to be 82 amino acids in length, like in most canine coronavirus strains and in three tgev-like reference strains, 119/08, 174/06 and 341/05, with the exception of 430/07, which is 7 amino acids shorter. the greek strains had high amino acid identity to each other (98.7%). e protein of strains 66/09 and 68/09 had the highest amino acid identity (100% and 98.7%, respectively) to the ccov-iib strains 341/05, 119/08, and to ccov-iia cb/05. in the e protein, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two strains were closely related to ccov type ii strains (fig. 2b) .the membrane protein (m protein) of strains 66/09 and 68/09 was found to be 260 and 262 amino acids long, respectively. two amino acids were missing from the nterminal end of the m protein of strain 66/09 in positions 24 and 36, as it has been also observed in reference ccov-iib strains 174/06 and 341/05. the two strains shared high amino acid similarity (94.6%). m protein of strains 66/09 and 68/09 had the highest amino acid identity to the ccov-iib reference strains detected in the organs (97.3% and 100%, respectively). phylogenetic analysis of the m protein showed that the two strains were closely related to ccov-iia and ccov-iib strains (fig. 2c) .the n gene (nucleoprotein) was found to be 1149 nucleotides in length, coding for a polypeptide of 382 amino acids. the two proteins were 98.1% similar. the amino acid sequences had the highest identity with ccov-iib 119/08 (98.6% and 99.4%, for 66/09 and 68/09, respectively). phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two greek strains were more closely related to ccov-ii reference strains (fig. 2d) .homologous rna recombination consists one of the major ''powers'' of genetic evolution and diversity, regarding coronaviruses (woo et al., 2009) . under field conditions, mixed infections are required to give rise to recombination events. so far, experimental infections of piglets (woods and wesley, 1992) and dogs (larson et al., 1979) with ccov and tgev strains, respectively, and the fact that feline aminopeptidase n serves as a functional receptor for both ccov and tgev (tresnan et al., 1996) , strongly suggest that the two viruses can be found growing table 1 ccov-ii rna copies/ml of template in the samples of the two puppies, tested by genotype-specific real time rt-pcr.66/09 (yorkshire  terrier) 68/09 (pomeranian) faeces 3.59 â 10 3 7.22 â 10 5 liver 4.64 â 10 4 3.21 â 10 5 spleen 5.20 â 10 5 1.55 â 10 7 pancreas 2.75 â 10 2 2.03 â 10 4 kidney 1.23 â 10 5 3.37 â 10 6 lung 5.99 â 10 6 4.10 â 10 6 heart 1.14 â 10 5 7.08 â 10 6 brain n.d. 2.47 â 10 3 n.d., not detected. at the same ''environment'' in nature, although the exact host of recombination still remains unknown. a canine coronavirus strain (ucd-1) of potential recombinant origin with tgev, was identified for the first time in the late 90s (wesley, 1999) . recently, tgev-like strains were reported, circulating in dogs in different countries of europe (decaro et al., 2010) . the strains were detected in faecal samples of dogs with gastroenteritis, they were classified as the new subtype ccov-iib and it was suggested that they were a result of recombination events, occurring at different times of these, regarding the old strain ucd-1 (decaro et al., 2010) . in the present study, sequence and phylogenetic analysis takes place for the first time in ccov-iib strains detected in greece.moreover, our findings suggest that tgev-like ccov strains spreading to the internal organs are circulating in dogs, since so far, there has been only one report in italy (decaro et al., 2009) . by means of real time rt-pcr, tissue distribution and quantitation of both strains were assessed for the first time, revealing the spreading of the virus to the internal organs. the cpv-2 coinfection may contribute to the spreading of tgev-like ccov strains, since so far, they have been only detected in organs of dogs infected also with cpv-2 (decaro et al., 2009 ). however, the detection of ccov-iia strains strictly in the faeces, in both cases, suggests that ccov-iib may have an advantage in disseminating through the dog. in the first report of tgev-like strains detected in the organs, ccov-i was also detected strictly in the intestinal content in two cases (decaro et al., 2009 ). these cases strongly suggest a difference in pathobiology of ccov-iib with respect to ccov-i/iia. by sequence and phylogenetic analysis, it was shown that both strains segregate constantly with the ccov-iib reference strains detected in the organs of dogs. accordingly, the strains were highly similar to tgev in the 5 0 end of the s gene, whereas they clustered with the pantropic ccov variant cb/05 (subtype ccov-iia) in the e, m and n proteins. in a previous study, ccov-iib strains detected in the organs were found to share higher amino acid identity with cb/05 than with ccov common enteric strains, at the level of the same proteins (decaro et al., 2009) . whether the ability of ccov-iib strains to spread to the organs is related to the recently recognized recombinant protein s or to the cb/05-like proteins (e, m and n) needs further research. however, the s-protein ''scenario'' seems to be more possible, since in coronaviruses s protein mediates receptor attachment, and tissue tropism shift has been associated with mutations in the s gene (masters, 2006) .in the last decade, new genotypes and subtypes of canine coronavirus have been recognized. furthermore, a pantropic variant with the ability to cause fatal systemic infection was detected (buonavoglia et al., 2006) . previous studies revealed that there are antigenic differences between ccov-i and ii (pratelli et al., 2004) . in addition, antigenic differences were observed between the two subtypes, ccov-iia and ccov-iib (tgev-like ccovs) (decaro et al., 2009) . whether the currently circulating vaccines can protect against the tgev-like recombinant isolates or not has to be verified via vaccinations and experimental infections.in conclusion, this was the first report of ccov-iib tissue distribution. up to now, there has been only one report of tgev-like strains detected in internal organs of puppies in italy. based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the structural proteins, the two greek isolates were found to be related to the italian prototype ccov-iib strains. in addition, in all cases a mixed infection with cpv-2 was reported. however, the detection of ccov-iia strains, strictly at the faeces, suggests that ccov-iib strains may have an advantage in disseminating throughout a dog with cpv-2 coinfection, in contrast to common enteric ccov-iia strains.respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection is the leading cause of acute respiratory tract disease in children less than 5 years old. the aim of this study was to further elucidate the molecular properties and clinical characteristics of rsv infection. the study sample included 238 patients <5 years old who were hospitalized with clinical symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (urti or lrti) in the pediatric department at the first people's hospital of chenzhou, south china in 2014. we subjected nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa) or nasal swab (ns) samples from the patients to indirect fluorescence assay screens. rsv g genes were amplified by reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) and sequenced. of the 238 patients screened, 64 (26.8%) were confirmed to have rsv infections. of those 64 confirmed rsv infection cases, 39 (60.9%) had subtype ba9, 13 (20.3%) had the recently identified subtype on1, 11 (17.2%) had subtype na1, and 1 (1.6%) had subtype gb2. the predominant presentation was lrti with coughing, sputum production, fever, and wheezing. rsv subtype na1 and ba9 infections were found mostly in infants, whereas the age distribution of subtype on1 infections was more uniform across the age bands. phylogenetic analysis indicated that, compared with the prototype strain a2, all on1 and most na1 isolates had lost one potential n-glycosylation site at amino acid 251 and 249 due to t251k and n249y substitution, respectively. these findings suggest that na1, ba9, and on1 are the dominant rsv subtypes causing respiratory tract infections in young children presenting to the hospital in south china. j. med. virol. 89:213-221, 2017 respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a common pathogen that induces acute lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis) in the elderly and in children, especially infants [nair et al., 2010] . a meta-analysis estimated that rsv accounts for 3.4 million hospitalizations and 66,000-199,000 deaths due to acute lrtis among children less than 5 years old worldwide [anderson, 2013] . due to the lack of available vaccines, rsvs circulate every season and induce mild to serious disease in children and elderly adults.rsv is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense rna virus that belongs to the genus pneumovirus of the paramyxoviridae family [collins and melero, 2011] . based on the genetic characteristics of the attachment protein (g protein) and monoclonal antibody reactions, rsvs are subdivided into two genotypes: genotype a (rsv-a) and genotype b (rsv-b) [mufson et al., 1985] . to date, 14 rsv-a subtypes (ga1-7, saa1-2, na1-4, and on1 [peret et al., 1998 [peret et al., , 2000 venter et al., 2001; shobugawa et al., 2009; eshaghi et al., 2012; pretorius et al., 2012; ren et al., 2014] ) and 22 rsv-b subtypes (gb1-5, sab1-4, uru1-2, ba1-10, and thb [peret et al., 1998 [peret et al., , 2000 venter et al., 2002; dapat et al., 2010; trento et al., 2010; auksornkitti et al., 2014; ren et al., 2015] ) have been described. the newly identified on1 subtype of rsv-a, which was first reported in canada in 2010 [eshaghi et al., 2012] , contains a unique 72-nucleotide duplication in the second hypervariable region of the g gene and may be spreading rapidly, perhaps replacing na1, another prevalent rsv-a subtype, in countries such as china, south korea, germany, and italy [kim et al., 2014; pierangeli et al., 2014; tabatabai et al., 2014; cui et al., 2015] . a similar duplication phenomenon in the variable region of the g protein was also observed in the ba subtype of rsv-b in 1999 in buenos aries, argentina [trento et al., 2003] ; this strain spread rapidly to additional countries, resulting in the current prevalence of rsv-b infections [dapat et al., 2010; trento et al., 2010] .the molecular epidemiological characteristics of rsv have been described previously for southwestern [zhang et al., 2010b; qin et al., 2013] , northwestern [zhang et al., 2010a; cui et al., 2015] and eastern china . however, there is limited information regarding the molecular epidemiology of rsv in south china. south china has a humid climate and a high frequency of acute respiratory infections in young children. in the present study, we screened hospitalized children under 5 years old with lrtis or upper respiratory tract infections (urtis) in chenzhou, china, and analyzed the molecular epidemiological characteristics of the rsv strains identified.the study was performed in the department of pediatric, the first people's hospital of chenzhou, university of south china in 2014, and the study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics committee. a total of 238 patients who met the following criteria were enrolled: (i) age <5 years old; (ii) hospitalized with one or more clinical symptoms of urti or lrti (i.e., cough, fever, wheezing, expectoration, anhelation, etc). demographic and clinical characteristic data were collected. written informed consent for participation in this study was obtained from the patients' parents.prior to admission, a nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa) or nasal swab (ns) was obtained from each patient to screen for rsv and other respiratory viruses with an indirect immunofluorescence assay (ifa) kit (d3 ultra dfa respiratory virus screen and id kit, diagnostic hybrids, inc., oh); rsvnegative patients were excluded from subsequent data analysis. all rsv positive npas or nss were stored at à80˚c for further molecular analysis by rsv reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) and phylogenetic analysis.rna was extracted from npa/ns samples which were identified as rsv infections by ifa using a tianamp virus dna/rna kit (tiangen, beijing, china). cdna was synthesized by using random hexamer primers and the tianscriptii rt kit (tiangen). rsv g gene amplification was performed by nested pcr. first-round amplification (sense primer, 5 0 -caa gca aat tyt ggc c-3 0 ; antisense primer, 5 0 -cct ytg cta act gca c-3 0 ) was conducted under the following thermocycling conditions: 94˚c for 3 min, followed by thirty 45-sec cycles at 94˚c, 48˚c for 30 sec, and 72˚c for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72˚c for 5 min. second-round amplification (sense primer, 5 0 -ggg caa atg caa aca tgt cc-3 0 ; anti-sense primer 5 0 -tcc att gtt att tgc ccc ag-3 0 ) was conducted with the same thermocycling conditions that were applied in the first round, except that the annealing temperature was increased to 54˚c. all pcr amplifications were performed with the tiangen 2â taq plus mastermix kit (tiangen).detection of other pathogens was performed in parallel using specific laboratory tests, including immunofluorescence to detect influenza a and b, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, and adenoviruses; enzymelinked immunosorbent assays to detect human coronavirus and mycoplasma pneumonia; and pcr to detect human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus. sputum and blood cultures for bacterial detection were also performed. all sputum samples were obtained on all children once before treatment by aspiration, unless the patient was suffering from severe progressive disease or ineffective treatment. and blood for bacterial culture was obtained from patients who had a fever.all positive pcr products were sequenced by the genscript (nanjing) company. the sequences were determined and analyzed using the basic local alignment search tool (blast) program available on the ncbi homepage (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast. cgi). a maximum likelihood tree was constructed in mega-5.1 software. the deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with mega-5.1 and bioedit software. potential n-glycosylation (asn-xaa-ser/thr) sites were predicted using the netnglyc 1.0 server (http://www. cbs.dtu.dk/services/netnglyc/). alignments of the second hyper-variable region of the g protein were compared to those available from genbank.ifa revealed that 64 of the 238 hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections who were screened (27%) had rsv infections. of those 64 patients, 48 (75%) were male, 16 (25%) were female. most, 63/64 (98.4%), were diagnosed with lrtis at the time of admission. cough (n ¼ 64, 100%), sputum production (n ¼ 61, 95.3%), wheezing (n ¼ 49, 76.5%), and fever (n ¼ 30, 46.9%) were the most common symptoms observed (table i) . previous allergies, including eczema, urticarial dermatitis, and asthma, were reported in 25 (39%) patients.sequencing of the rsv g gene in the patient samples indicated that 24/64 (37.5%) and 40/64 (62.5%) patients had rsv genotypes a and b, respectively, demonstrating simultaneous circulation of rsv-a and -b in the study area. furthermore, in the 24 rsv-a-infected patients, subtypes on1 (n ¼ 13, 54%) and na1 (n ¼ 11, 46%) were predominant; and 39 of the 40 rsv-b-infected patients were infected with rsv subtype ba9. thus, subtypes on1, na1, and ba9 are the dominant circulating subtypes that cause respiratory infections in children in this geographical area.on1 is a newly identified rsv-a subtype [eshaghi et al., 2012] , and our data indicate that on1 infections exhibit some differences in the age of onset compared to na1. na1 mostly infected children less than 6 months old (81.8%), whereas on1 did not show this trend.in total, co-infecting viruses were detected in 9 (15.7%) of the 64 rsv-infected patient samples, with human coronavirus being the most common (table ii) . bacteria were isolated from 14 (21.9%) of the patient samples, with escherichia coli accounting for six of those 14. mycoplasma was detected in 3 (4.5%) of the patient samples. bacteria were mainly isolated from sputum (n ¼ 9), including e. coli (n ¼ 4), klebsiella pneumoni (n ¼ 2), straphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumonia, and serratia marcescens (each n ¼ 1). in the remaining five cases, bacteria were detected in blood cultures (table ii) .sequences of the g gene from 24 rsv-a and 40 rsv-b isolates were successfully obtained and aligned with representative genbank sequences of previously published genotypes. the rsv-a strains were clustered into two subtypes: on1 with a 72 nucleotide g gene duplication and na1 (fig. 1a) .the rsv-b strains were clustered into two subtypes: ba9 with a duplication of 60 nucleotides and gb2 (fig. 1b) .to evaluate the circulating of rsv in china, we analyzed the predominant genotype of human rsv in children from northeastern (beijing), eastern (suzhou and shanghai), southwestern (chongqing), and northwestern (lanzhou) china in the most recent 8 years (table iii) . these regions have experienced infections with similar subtypes of rsv (abbaaba) in the last 8 years [zhang et al., 2010a [zhang et al., ,b, 2013 cui et al., 2013 cui et al., , 2015 qin et al., 2013; liu et al., 2014; ren et al., 2014] . however, we lacked the complete datasets from lanzhou and chenzhou. additionally, the na1 and ga2 subtypes have been the predominant rsv-a subtypes present, and the ba9 subtype has been the predominant rsv-b subtype present. there are distinct subtypes of rsv-a present in beijing (na1), shanghai (na1), and chongqing (ga2), and lanzhou (ga2) from 2007 to 2011. the predominant rsv genotype in the present study sample was rsv-b, whereas that identified in a study in beijing in the same time period was rsv-a (table iii) .we aligned and compared 19 hunan rsv genotype a (on1 and na1) and 21 genotype b, with the prototype strain a2 (genbank accession number m11486) (fig. 2) and ch10b (gb1) strain (genbank accession number af065250) (fig. 3) , respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of subgroup na1 and on1 observed in this study had two predicted lengths (297 and 321 aa) due to the duplication of amino acids 261-283 (i.e., qeetlhsttsegylspsqvytts). and the predicted lengths were 298 and 320 for the ch10b and ba9 subtypes due to the duplication of amino acids 241-260 (i.e., erdtstpqstvldtttskht) and the loss of amino acids 167-168 (i.e., pk; data are not shown), respectively.compared to the a2 prototype, on1 subtypespecific substitutions (s222p, e232g, t253k, and p292l) were observed in all of the on1 subtypes. there were six unique amino acid substitutions for na1: n251y, p310l, p313s, s314p, p316s, and p317s. in the a2 prototype strain, there are three potential n-glycosylation sites (nxt, where x is not a proline) in the second variable region of the g protein. however, all of the on1 isolates and most of the na1 isolates had lost the n-glycosylation site at amino acid 251and 249 due to t251k and n249y substitutions, respectively (fig. 2) . compared to the gb1, all ba9 strains had t207p, a215d, p219l, t223p, t229i, l237p, e238k, s247p, l257s, v270a, and l287y substitutions (fig. 3) .sequences of g-protein genes were submitted to genbank (accession numbers kt781344-kt781406).rsv is the most common pathogen that causes lrtis in infants and young children [eshaghi et al., 2012] , but few studies of the molecular epidemiology of rsv have been conducted in china, especial south china. in this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity and patterns of co-circulating genotypes of both rsv-a and rsv-b subtypes in chenzhou, south china, in 2014. of the 64 rsv positive cases, 24 were rsv-a and 40 were rsv-b, respectively. phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the majority of the rsv-b strains clustered with ba9 and that the rsv-a strains clustered with strains of the new genotype, on1 and its ancestor, na1. in line with other studies in china and elsewhere, this study reports ba (ba9) as the predominant genotype [zhang et al., 2010b; rebuffo-scheer et al., 2011; yamaguchi et al., 2011; ren et al., 2015] , suggesting that this subgroup has undergone adaptation and rapid spreading. interestingly, the predominant subtype in chenzhou from 2013 to 2014 was different from that in beijing, which may be due to the differing climates between the two regions.the novel on1 genotype, which has a 72-nucleotide duplication in the c-terminal third of the g-protein gene, was first detected during the winter of 2010-2011 in ontario, canada [eshaghi et al., 2012] . a similar duplication phenomenon in the variable region of the g-protein was also observed in the 1999ba genotype of rsv-b [trento et al., 2010] . over the last 15 years, the ba subtype became the globally dominant rsv-b strain [dapat et al., 2010;  the result were based on blood culture. fig. 1 . phylogenetic tree of rsv-a and rsv-b isolates and reference sequences of identified genotypes. phylogenetic trees for rsv-a and rsv-b isolates were constructed with maximum-likelihood methods using mega 5.1 software. hunan/china rsv strains are indicated by "hn" followed by their strain identification number. reference strains representing known genotypes were retrieved from genbank and indicated by solid triangles followed by their accession number. the genotype assignment is shown on the right by brackets. tree topology was supported with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. bootstrap values greater than 50 are shown at branch nodes. trento et al., 2010; zhang et al., 2010b; rebuffo-scheer et al., 2011; yamaguchi et al., 2011; ren et al., 2015] . now, on1 has thus far been detected in many countries, including canada [eshaghi et al., 2012] , italy [pierangeli et al., 2014] , germany [tabatabai et al., 2014] , china [cui et al., 2013; liu et al., 2014; ren et al., 2014] , japan [hirano et al., 2014] , malaysia [khor et al., 2013] , india [choudhary et al., 2013] , south korea [lee et al., 2012] , thailand [auksornkitti et al., 2014] , kenya [agoti et al., 2014] , and south africa [valley-omar et al., 2013] . these studies suggest that the on1 subtype was transmitted globally and rapidly. supporting this notion, many countries have reported that on1 has become the predominant subtype [lee et al., 2012; agoti et al., 2014; pierangeli et al., 2014; tabatabai et al., 2014] . thus, whether the on1 subtype will follow the pattern of the ba subtype and become the predominant strain of rsv-a worldwide is a question of great interest.in china, the on1 strain was first reported in beijing (bj/35320) in 2012 [zhang et al., 2010a] . later, circulation of the on1 genotype was reported in chongqing [ren et al., 2014] , and shanghai . according to the circulating pattern of the rsv subtypes in chongqing, the na1 genotype has been the predominant rsv-a strain for the past 8 years, and the on1 genotype will be the predominant rsv-a subtype in 2014-2015 (table iii) [ren et al., 2014] . our results, which are in line with this circulation pattern, indicate that the on1 genotype was the predominant rsv-a subtype in 2014, suggesting that a rapid spread of this emerging rsv strain had occurred. thus, the on1 genotype may become the predominant strain of rsv in china, but further study will be needed to confirm this possibility.phylogenetic and deduced amino acid sequence analyses of the c-terminal hyper-variable region of the g protein among rsv strains revealed that ongoing changes characterized the different clusters within the rsv-a subtype. similar to previous studies conducted in china, the on1 genotype was characterized by e232g, t253k, and p292l substitutions [ren et al., 2014] . additionally, an s222p substitution was also observed in all on1 genotypes. interestingly, all of the on1 strains and almost all of the na1 strains had lost the n-glycosylation site at amino acid 251 due to t251k and n249y substitutions, respectively [auksornkitti et al., 2014] . however, it is not clear how these changes favored evasion of the host immune response.in accordance with a prior study [hall et al., 2009] , most of the rsv-infected children in this study were diagnosed with bronchiolitis or pneumonia after presenting with the symptoms of cough, persistent wheezing, fever, and sputum production. presentation of clinical symptoms did not differ between patients with rsv-a versus rsv-b infections. our age-group analysis revealed that infants under 1 year of age accounted for 75.6% of the detected rsv infections and infants less than 6 months old accounted for $53%. interestingly, the age distribution of patients with subtype on1 infections was more uniform across age groups, whereas the na1 and ba9 subtypes were found mostly in infants less than 6 months old. thus, we hypothesized that the on1 genotype is a novel rsv genotype, and given that most children were infected with on1 for the first time, we reasoned that the organism must have no specific protective immunity. conversely, na1 and ba9 mainly infected infants less than 6 months of age likely because infection provides protective immunity thereafter, although limited. thus, the vast majority of rsv reinfections are with genetically distinct strains [agoti et al., 2012] . unfortunately, the sample size of this study was not large enough to confirm this reasoning.in summary, the molecular characterization of rsv in this geographical area in 2014 indicated that genotypes ba9, na1, and on1 co-circulated and that the predominant genotype was ba9. in line with other studies in china and elsewhere, it can be hypothesized that subgroup on1 will become the predominant strain of rsv-a worldwide similar to the emergence of the ba genotype. these findings will improve the understanding of the molecular characterization of rsv in south china. however, further surveillance of circulating rsv genotypes, genetic diversity, and the corresponding clinical data is needed to better understand the antigenic mechanisms of rsv infections.nucleotide skew analysis [1] provides a powerful tool to visualize compositional aspects of a dna/rna sequence. for instance, the minimum and maximum of a g vs c skew can be used to predict the origin of replication and the location of the terminus, respectively, in prokaryotic genomes [2] [3] [4] . e genskew algorithm [1] calculates ratio values of the six nucleotide combinations (c vs g, g vs a, u vs g, u vs a, c vs a, and u vs c) in predefined windows and steps along a sequence. ratio values are calculated according to (n1-n2)/(n1+n2), and hence, a positive value indicates that n1 wins over n2. skew graphs are generally created by plotting the subsequent windows as numbers on the x-axis against the corresponding cumulative skew values on the y-axis. in this way, we demonstrated for a representative collection of rna viruses that the skew plots can be interpreted as "nucleotide compositional signatures" of the viral genomes and that these characteristic signatures are more prominently observed in the single-stranded regions than that in the basepaired, double-stranded regions of a viral rna genome [5] . likewise, we demonstrated that purine enrichment in the zika virus rna genome [6] is a general property of most but not all flaviviridae and, surprisingly, prominently observed at the first position of the codons and not the silent 3 rd codon position (unpublished results). it is, however, difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative to compare different skew graphs with respect to similarities and dissimilarities. we therefore developed a simple mathematical addition to genskew analysis that converts skew data into a pairwise euclidean distance matrix, which can be formatted by means of clustering into a neighbourjoining tree, facilitating the identification of putative relationships, e.g., between viral sequences. e key result of this study is that this euclidean algorithm offers an easy and quantitative interpretation of nucleotide skew data of virus genomes. e construction of euclidean distance trees based on skewed nucleotide compositions does not require a prior alignment of the sequences. in contrast, "classical" phylogenetic trees are modelled after accurate nucleotide alignment of the sequences. as an additional result, we demonstrate that skew distance trees and phylogenetic trees are surprisingly similar but not identical.nucleotide sequences of the single-stranded (ss) rna genomes of coronavirus, picornavirus, and hiv (reference strains and unclassified species) were downloaded from the viralzone database (http://viralzone.expasy.org/) [7, 8] . flaviviridae were selected and classified according to [9, 10] (berkhout and van hemert, unpublished results). genbank ids are provided in the figures. nucleotide skew analysis was done by means of the genskew algorithm [1] , of which dr. t. rattei (technische universität münchen) kindly provided a version that is not restricted by the length of a sequence. for normalization purposes, the overlapping window size was set 1% of the sequence length with a step size of 20% of the window size. e skew between two nucleotides n1 and n2 is defined by the ratio (n1 − n2)/(n1 + n2), and hence, a positive value of this ratio indicates that n1 proportionally exceeds n2. if the n1 versus n2 comparison results in a negative skew value, the same but positive skew value is true for these nucleotides in the reverse order (n2 versus n1). algorithms converting skew data into a pairwise euclidean distance matrix are provided as additional file s1. e multiple sequence alignment of coronaviral, flaviviral, picornaviral, and hiv genomes was obtained by means of mafft [11] . other alignments and neighbor joining (nj) skew distance trees were built in mega v7 [12] . phylogenetic histories were inferred by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution in the viral genomes [12] . a discrete gamma distribution (5 categories) was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. e tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. randomization of the rubella virus rna genome (10 consecutive cycles to ensure complete nucleotide randomization) was performed by means of the bioweb server (http://www.cellbiol.com/ scripts/randomizer/dna_protein_sequence_randomizer. php). all calculations were performed in excel.we used the rubella virus with its g-and c-rich rna genome (jn635295) to illustrate the skew plot analysis (figure 1) .skew profiles are shown of the nucleotide sequence before figure 1 (a) and after 10 consecutive cycles of randomization figure 1 (b). e profiles are nearly identical because skew profiles are determined solely by nucleotide composition and not by the nucleotide sequence. e rubella virus rna genome size is 9761 nucleotides, and hence, the window size and step size are set to 98 (1% of sequence length) and 20 (20% of window size), respectively, generating 489 overlapping windows from the 5′-to the 3′-end (x-axis) with the corresponding skew values cumulatively plotted on the y-axis. e skew lines start by definition at the origin of the plot. it should be noted that, in skew language, cg does not represent a cg base pair but a comparison of the c with the g nucleotide proportions. we adopted the notation c versus g (c vs g) in the text and the figures. e nucleotides c and g win over a (steep positive slope), and the u-nucleotide loses from c and g (steep negative slope) by approximately the same proportion. c is slightly more prominent than g, and the proportions of u and a are close to equality. importantly, the skew profiles are straight lines, which indicates that the virus-specific nucleotide bias is quite constant along the sequence of the rna genome. erefore, skew values at the ultimate 3′ end of the genome (position 489) represent a reliable measure of the pairwise nucleotide compositional bias of the rubella virus genome. for instance, the skew endpoint values of c vs a (216.24) and u vs c (−213.37) are very similar but with the opposite sign. e same is true for g vs a (169.79) and u vs g (−168.02), and the skew endpoint values for c vs g and u vs a are 56.39 and 2.31, respectively. for the rubella virus genome, these values can be considered a characteristic signature of the nucleotide composition and presented as a vector in a sixdimensional euclidean space (c vs g, g vs a, u vs g, u vs a, c vs a, u vs c) � (56.39, 169.79, −168.02, 2.31, 216.24, −213.37). e skew lines (n1 − n2)/(n1 + n2) are shown of the rubella virus genome sequence (figure 1 (a)) and the same sequence after 10 consecutive cycles of nucleotide randomization ( figure 1(b) ). overlapping windows are plotted on the x-axis against the corresponding skew values cumulatively on the y-axis.e algorithm outlined above can be applied to sets of sequences provided that one carefully preserves the order of nucleotide comparisons as well as the normalization of window and step sizes to gain ±500 cumulative skew values. e resulting vectors can be formatted into a pairwise euclidean distance matrix and visualized by means of cluster analysis as a neighbor-joining tree. it should be emphasized that the branch nodes of the skew value trees predict equality of the nucleotide skew values among the viral species involved. in contrast, branch nodes of evolutionary trees derived by means of nucleotide substitution models mark the expectation of sequence equality-the common ancestor-of the taxa involved. hence, only partial similarity between the two tree building methods can be expected. here, we applyh e p v -a k p 3 2 5 4 0 1 h e p v -n k p 6 4 1 1 2 7 h p g v 2 n c 0 2 7 9 9 8 w l s v k r 9 0 2 7 2 9 p p g v 9 0 3 k u 3 5 computational and mathematical methods in medicine the procedure to collections of arbitrarily chosen genomes of picornaviruses, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and hiv-1 subtypes. first, we investigated whether the euclidean skew algorithm is able to discern differences among the four families of viral genomes. next, the four viral families are individually subjected to the euclidean skew analysis.indeed, the neighbor-joining tree (figure 2 (a)) shows a consistent clustering of the hiv-1 subtypes (red), the coronaviruses (black), and the flaviviral species (blue). e picornaviruses (green) are significantly less resolved. notably, hiv-1 genomes share a enrichment as the common feature of their nucleotide composition [13] , coronavirus genomes typically tend to accumulate the u-nucleotide [14] , and the flaviviridae displays enhanced purine proportions in the first codon positions (unpublished results). e genomes of picornavirus species do not display such a prominent compositional feature. apparently, the skew algorithm is able to discern viral families by giving credit to unique compositional features that are typical of a virus family. viral genomes with a nucleotide composition that is more relaxed like picornavirus rna are resolved poorly by the skew algorithm. a "classically" constructed phylogeny of the viruses shows a similar grouping (figure 2(b) ). hiv (red), coronavirus (black), and flavivirus species (blue) are clustered in separated clades, whereas representatives of picornavirus are found scattered among the flavi-and coronaviruses. with respect to salivirus, aichivirus, footand-mouth disease virus, and hepatitis a virus, both trees show similar topological positions, but in general, this is not the case. in addition, construction of "classical" phylogenetic trees relies a great deal on the accurate alignment of the sequences involved, which becomes less reliable as the evolutionary distance of the taxa increases. for that reason, we separately analyzed the four virus families.virus genomes are mentioned by short names and genbank ids and are colored black (coronaviruses), blue (flaviviruses), green (picornaviruses), and red (hivs). e trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering (nj, figure 2 (a)) and by maximum likelihood phylogeny (ml, figure 2(b) ). e scale bars are in skew units (figure 2(a) ) or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site (figure 2(b) ).3.3.1. coronavirus. coronavirus rna genomes show high u and low c proportions that are quite variable and in fact act like communicating vessels [14] . indeed, a bipartition can be observed in the cluster tree based on euclidean skew distances (figure 3(a) ). e upper group containing the mers and sars (in red) isolates is characterized by relatively low u vs c skew values varying from 120 to 31. e lower group with the human 229e, nl63, and oc43 coronaviruses displays u vs c skew values increasing from 140 to 201. apparently, the opposite movement of the u and c proportions in coronaviral genomes is a distinctive feature, and hence, an important parameter in shaping coronaviral phylogenies is based on nucleotide substitution (figure 3(b) ). we included two unclassified virus isolates-marked in italic-to investigate whether the method can contribute to an initial virus classification. e unclassified bat-rousettus isolate is found near the vespertilio coronavirus, and the unclassified bat-bm48-31 isolate is at the root position of in the upper clade.coronavirus genomes are mentioned by short names and genbank ids. clustering of mers and sars coronaviruses is indicated by coloring in red. numbers in brackets indicate u versus c skew values. two clades differing by u vs c skew values can be discerned in the skew-based tree, the upper clade with u vs c proportions decreasing from 120 to 31 and the lower clade with u vs c proportions decreasing from 201 to 140. e two unclassified isolates are italicized. e trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering (nj, figure 3 (a)) and by maximum likelihood phylogeny (ml, figure 3(b) ). e scale bars are in skew units figure 3 (a) or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site figure 3(b) . e flaviviridae represent an extensive group of ssrna viruses with a diverse nucleotide composition. yet, the pairwise distance tree based on skew values (figure 4(a) ) is in remarkable agreement with the topology obtained by means of evolutionary models (figure 4 (b)) [9] . dengue virus (denv), bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), yellow fever virus (yfv), zika virus (zikav), west nile virus (wnv) species, and the unclassified bamaga flavivirus are clustered into the clade of mosquito-borne flaviviruses. e unclassified anopheles, menghai, and xishuangbanna flaviviruses map in between the mosquito-borne viruses and the tick-borne representative (louping ill virus, liv). e insect-specific culex flavivirus (cxfv) and cell fusing agent virus (cfav) cluster together. finally, the skew algorithm distinguishes the hepaciviruses from the pegiviruses (including wenling shark virus, wlsv) consistent with more classical phylogeny [10] .flavivirus genomes are mentioned by short names and genbank ids. representatives of the flaviviruses are colored red (dengue virus and pestivirus), green (flavivirus), blue (tick-borne flavivirus), light-blue (insect-specific flavivirus), yellow (hepacivirus), and magenta (pegivirus). e five unclassified flavivirus genomes are italicized. e trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering (nj, figure 4 (a)) and by maximum likelihood phylogeny (ml, figure 4(b) ). e scale bars are in skew units (figure 4(a) ) or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site (figure 4(b) ).e skew cluster tree of picornaviruses ( figure 5(a) ) also matches the tree topology based on nucleotide substitution ( figure 5(b) ). as an exception, the rhinoviruses of humans and equines are close neighbors based on skew values that are separated more distantly in the standard evolutionary tree. two of the three unclassified picornaviruses (washington bat and bat crohivirus) map in the cluster of avian emv and hepatitis a virus. e unclassified african bat icavirus takes a position in between rosavirus 2 and two rhinoviruses.picornavirus genomes are mentioned by short names and genbank ids. e three unclassified picornavirus genomes are italicized. e trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering (nj, figure 5 (a)) and by maximum likelihood phylogeny (ml, figure 5(b) ). e scale bars are in skew units ( figure 5(a) ) or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site ( figure 5(b) ).e reference sequences of hiv-1 subtypes show much less compositional divergence than corona-, flavi-, and picornaviruses as indicated by the approximately 10x smaller size of the scale bar ( figure 6 ). in fact, the nucleotide skew profiles are nearly identical to the average skew value with small standard deviation (table 1 ). e wellknown a-accumulation in hiv-1 genomes [13] is prominently demonstrated by the negative values for g vs a, u vs a, and c vs a ( respectively). a-accumulation occurred mainly at the expense of c (c vs g: 77.15; u vs c: 59.48). similar calculations for average skew values and standard deviations of coronavirus, flavivirus, and picornavirus genomes did not provide useful avg and stdev data (table 1) .hiv-1 subtype genomes are mentioned by subtype and genbank ids. e trees were constructed by means of neighbor-joining clustering (nj, figure 6 (a)) and by maximum likelihood phylogeny (ml, figure 6(b) ). e scale bars are in skew units (figure 6(a) ) or estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site ( figure 6(b) ).differences can be observed between the euclidean skew tree of hiv-1 subtypes and the hiv-1 topology based on regular nucleotide substitution models ( figure 6 ). for instance, the evolutionary tree indicates a close relationship of f1 and f2 strains and between both hiv-1-crf isolates, which is not observed in the skew-based tree. e dominant a-pressure in hiv may drive the compositional signatures of different hiv sequences towards similar skew values, by which the resolving power of the euclidean skew algorithm becomes insufficient for a proper discrimination among hiv-1 subtypes. in addition, different sequences may have similar skew profiles. for example, randomization of a sequence does not alter the skew profile of the nucleotides (figure 1 ). finally, unclassified hiv-1 subtypes were not found in the viralzone database.pairwise euclidean distance analysis facilitates an easy initial interpretation of the relationships among viral sequences based on skew values as a nucleotide compositional signature. e algorithm distinguishes related and unrelated sequences, particularly in case of compositional features that are characteristic for a certain virus family (e.g., a-accumulation in hiv, the u-c balance in coronavirus genomes, and the purine enrichment at the first codon position in flaviviral genomes). within a family of viral genomes, the topology based on euclidean skew distances is surprisingly similar (but not identical) to the topology based on regular evolutionary analysis (coronavirus, flavivirus, and picornavirus). is is remarkable because branch nodes in skewbased trees predict equal skew values of both sequences, and, in contrast, branch nodes in evolutionary trees mark nucleotide sequence equality of the two taxa. e resolving power of skew value analysis is diminished at high sequence similarity as shown for hiv-1 subtypes. is is due to the prominent a-pressure in all hiv genomes [15] .e key focus of this research was the euclidean analysis of nucleotide skew data among virus genomes. in addition, we demonstrated similarity of skew data-based cluster trees with "classical" maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed via a general time reversible (gtr) model of nucleotide substitution during evolution. confidence of ancestral nodes in "classical" trees is usually attained by means of bootstrap analysis, which requires repetitive resampling of sites in the original sequence alignment. each bootstrap replicate generates a tree, and a consensus tree is constructed based on the collection of replicates. each node in this consensus tree is decorated with the frequency number (%) that reflects the level of bootstrap support. it is evident that a skew-based pairwise distance matrix cannot be used for bootstrap analysis simply due to the absence of a sequence alignment. also, resampling of sites in a sequence prior to skew analysis does not affect the skew data vector (figure 1 ). future investigation may reveal whether the computational and mathematical methods in medicine building of skew-based trees may serve as a valuable addition to many sequence-independent methods of evolutionary tree reconstruction.euclidean skew analysis supports the study of nucleotide compositional features and facilitates the classification of unclassified viral sequences as nearest neighbors of classified ones. compared with methods based on nucleotide substitution models, (euclidean) skew analysis is very robust in that it tolerates sequence errors and shifts in reading frames.data availability e relevant databases viralzone and genbank used to support the findings of this study are included within the article (materials and methods). e genbank ids of the sequences are provided in the figures. e software used is mentioned by the references as provided by mafft and mega. nucleotide randomization was performed by a bioweb server application. e genskew algorithm was provided by dr. t. rattei. a web server version can be found at http://genskew.csb.univie.ac.at/.e authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. identifying and determining the nature of species interactions of multiple pathogens within hosts is increasingly considered critical to understanding infectious disease dynamics (e.g., pedersen & fenton 2007; johnson et al. 2015; seabloom et al. 2015; fountain-jones et al. 2018) . individuals are often co-infected by a diverse infra-community of pathogens, and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection dynamics (cattadori et al. 2008; susi et al. 2015) and influence disease outcomes (moss et al. 2008; munson et al. 2008; wejse et al. 2015) . pathogens that form chronic, long-lasting infections are ubiquitous and are likely to overlap pathogens that produce short-lasting acute infections (fenton 2008; randall et al. 2013; rynkiewicz et al. 2015; aivelo & norberg 2018) . chronic pathogens can compete for the same resources as acute pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection (randall et al. 2013; budischak et al. 2018) or, conversely, facilitate infection via immune suppression (e.g., geldmacher & koup 2012) .interactions between chronic pathogens, such as between helminths and bacteria, are relatively well understood (e.g., ezenwa 2016 ), yet interactions between chronic and acute pathogens, particularly between microparasite species, are largely unknown. as humans, for example, are on average exposed to ten chronic and acute virus species alone (xu et al. 2015) , untangling the ecological interactions between microparasites represents a clear knowledge gap that has significant consequences for understanding pathogen dynamics (munson et al. 2008) .discriminating between positive or negative interactions between pathogens in populations is complicated by the short time window that an acute pathogen is shedding (and thus detectable with molecular methods) and by potentially confounding host environments (tompkins et al. 2011) . this is particularly the case for microparasites where pathogen detection often relies on serology, and, thus, without resampling the same individual, the precise timing of exposure cannot be estimated. detection of chronic pathogens may be more straightforward as the infection is active for more extended periods, but deducing pathogen interactions is difficult without extensive longitudinal data (tompkins et al. 2011; fenton et al. 2014) . identifying whether two pathogens interact due to host-habitat preferences, the increasing likelihood of exposure with age, or infra-community processes such as competition is methodologically challenging (poulin 2007; johnson & buller 2011; fenton et al. 2014; clark et al. 2016) .further, competition between pathogens could result in increased mortality associated with a particular combination of pathogens (su et al. 2005) .detecting interactions between pathogens is also likely to depend on taxonomic and spatial scales that are seldom considered (stutz et al. 2018) . studies commonly aggregate pathogen data to genus level, but interactions between pathogens can be subtype or genotype-specific (e.g., wejse et al. 2015; benesh & kalbe 2016; brook et al. 2017) . for example, individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 (hiv-1) are four times more likely to become coinfected with tuberculosis compared to individuals with hiv-2 (wejse et al. 2015) . beyond subtype or genus, genotype-specific associations have been demonstrated in snails infected by trematodes (louhi et al. 2015) and in rodents infected by bartonella bacteria (brook et al. 2017 ).infra-community dynamics are also likely to vary with spatiotemporal scale. for example, pathogen associations in amphibian communities differed substantially at the host scale compared to the pond scale, but these effects can be reversed or undetected at other scales (stutz et al. 2018) . in general, interactions between free-living species are more apparent at scales although pathogen co-occurrence networks are valuable for quantifying broad structural patterns, they do not account for environmental or host factors or differences in spatial or temporal scale. joint species distribution models fill this gap by simultaneously assessing environmental influences and interspecific co-occurrences across multiple scales using hierarchical bayesian mixed models (warton et al. 2015; ovaskainen et al. 2017 ). here we use both co-occurrence network and joint species distribution models to examine the structure of pathogen-pathogen networks and quantify pathogen associations whilst controlling for environmental and host factors. we collate ten years of data on acute and chronic pathogens in 105 african lions (panthera leo) as well as extensive host and environmental data from the serengeti lion project (slp, packer et al. 2005) . the slp datasets provides a unique opportunity to understand pathogen co-occurrence networks in a wild population whilst controlling for group, individual and environmental characteristics. we use this data to ask the following interlinked questions:to what degree is the co-occurrence network of pathogens in serengeti lions nested or segregated?(ii) after accounting for environmental and host factors, is the type of chronic infection an individual is infected by associated with subsequent exposure to an acute pathogen? are there important chronic-chronic or acute-acute pathogen cooccurrence patterns?we view co-occurrence at two levels of taxonomic resolution and across spatiotemporal scales.we describe a step-analytical pathway that can assess broad network structure and quantify pathogen interactions across multiple scales that can generally be applied to infectious disease dynamics. detecting pathogen co-occurrence patterns not only provides novel insights into pathogen infra-community dynamics but also helps aide surveillance efforts and generates testable hypotheses that can be answered in laboratory experiments.pathogen data serological testing and quantitative pcr (qpcr) was performed to detect acute and chronic pathogens from blood samples taken from lions in the serengeti national park, tanzania from 1984-1994. in total, 394 individuals were sampled throughout this period, but our analysis was restricted to the 105 individuals tested for the full suite of pathogens (see table 1 for pathogen natural history and table s1 for the number of individuals tested per year included in the analyses). nomadic individuals (i.e. lions that were not resident in any pride) were excluded due to the difficulty of assigning environmental variables (see confounding variables below).serological data for canine distemper virus (cdv), feline calicivirus, parvovirus, and coronavirus has been published previously (packer et al. 1999 but see table s2 for assay details), with the exception of rift valley fever (rvf). to detect rvf exposure we conducted a plaque reduction virus neutralizing test (prnt) that quantified virus neutralizing antibodies from serum as per the scott et al. (1986) protocol. anthrax (bacilus anthracis) and feline herpes virus were excluded from analysis because all lions were seropositive (packer et al. 1999; lembo et al. 2011) . similarly, feline leukemia virus (felv) was also excluded because al lions were seronegative (hofmann-lehmann et al. 1996) .we used qpcr for identification of nucleotides for feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv ple ) and the protozoan pathogens in this study (table 1) . three distinct subtypes of fiv ple co-circulate in lions in the serengeti (troyer et al. 2005 (troyer et al. , 2011 antunes et al. 2008 ) and thus subtype specific qpcr was performed (see troyer et al. 2004 troyer et al. , 2005 for qpcr protocols). the resultant 300 base pair sequences from the pol gene were aligned and assigned to 21 operational taxonomic units/genotypes based on a 95% molecular similarity threshold (see fountain-jones et al. 2017 for details). lions also commonly get chronically infected by a rich protozoan fauna including babesia and hepatazoon genera. we developed quantitative pcr protocols using density gel gradient electrophoresis to identify each protozoan species (see munson et al. 2008) .we categorized each pathogen as chronic or acute based on the literature and, as the biology of most of these pathogens in lions are poorly understood, age-prevalence relationships. pathogens which peak in prevalence at a young age (<= 2 y.o.) with little temporal fluctuation were considered to be chronic, whereas an increasing age-prevalence relationship and high temporal variation were classified as more acute (fig. s1 ). feline coronavirus can have both acute and chronic forms and it is impossible to assess which form the individual was exposed to from serological data, but based on age-prevalence relationships we categorized it as a chronic infection (fig. s1 ). as most individual lions were likely to be infected by chronic infections within the first two years after birth (troyer et al. 2011, fig . s1), we assume that acute exposure typically occurred whilst the individual was infected by the chronic pathogen. we then partitioned the chronic pathogen data into two sets based on taxonomic resolution (high and medium). the high taxonomic resolution dataset encompassed fiv ple genotype and babesia species data, whereas the medium resolution dataset aggregated fiv ple subtype information and babesia data to genus level.summary co-occurrence network 1 0we created a summary co-occurrence matrix (n*n) (griffiths et al. 2014 ) that described the amount of co-occurrence of both chronic and acute pathogens within individuals by multiplying the incidence matrix (i.e., contingency table that described the occurrence of pathogens across individuals) by its transpose. we then computed a measure ( ) of network structure and modularity index based on node overlap and segregation (strona & veech 2015) .is scaled from -1 to 1, where -1 represents an entirely segregated network and 1 represents an entirely nested network.the co-occurrence matrix was also used to evaluate preferential associations among pathogens utilizing a modularity-based ''greedy'' approach (clauset et al. 2004) . measures of modularity aim to determine the adequacy of different classification schemes in representing clusters and divisions in datasets; here, the clusters represented the co-occurrence of pathogens in individual hosts. estimates of modularity were calculated for each possible classification by comparing the expected fraction of co-occurrence of pathogens compared to the quantity if the co-occurrences happened randomly (newman 2006) . the classification with the highest modularity from all the generated classifications was selected. this analysis was performed using the igraph library in r (csárdi & nepusz 2006) .the co-occurrence matrix was obtained from the incidence matrix using the graph.incidence and the bipartite.projection functions. the classification analysis was performed using the fastgreedy.community function and graphical output were produced using the tkplot function in igraph.joint species distribution modeling 1 1 1we fitted joint species distribution models (jdsm) for both high and medium taxonomic resolution datasets, combining information on environmental and host covariates (see confounding variables below for details), to the occurrence data for each of the pathogens.pathogens detected fewer than five times were excluded from this analysis. we fitted all the jsdms with bayesian inference, using "hierarchical modelling of species communities"("hmsc" blanchet et al. 2018) . for each analysis, we modeled the response pathogen coexposure matrix using a probit model. in each model we added individual, pride-year (i.e., which pride and year the individual was sampled in) and year sampled as random effects. we utilized the default priors of the framework (described in full detail in ovaskainen et al. 2017) and ran the hmsc model twice using 3 million mcmc samples (the first 300 000 of which being burnin). each run was carried out using a different seed. visual inspection of mcmc traces were performed to assess convergence. in addition, we made sure that the effective sample size (ess) of each parameter was > 200.as part of the slp, most of the individuals in this study have been regularly observed since birth ). we selected 13 predictor variables that we thought were likely to be important for pathogen exposure and thus could confound possible interaction patterns (table 2 ). we included variables that captured individual variability (e.g., age at sampling), and pride characteristics including environmental variables (e.g., average vegetation cover of the pride's territory; see table 2 for measurement details). we attempted to calibrate each predictor set based on possible epidemic year (e.g., calculating rainfall for the year the individual was co-infected by the acute pathogen) as determined by packer et al. (1999) , 1 2 however this removed a large number of males from the dataset as their natal pride were unknown and this reduced the power of our analyses.not including anthrax and herpes (to which all individuals had been exposed), the serengeti lions were exposed to an average of 5 pathogens (two acute and three chronic, sd = 1) with one individual had been infected by 9 of 10 pathogens (based on medium resolution data, fig. s3 ).remarkably, cubs between 1 and 2 y.o. had been already infected with an average of 4 pathogens (sd = 1) with one 1.5 y.o cub positive for 5. all lions were qpcr positive for at least one protozoan species, and 25% of them were infected by all four considered.the high taxonomic resolution summary network indicated a significantly nested architecture ( = 0.74) with relatively low modularity (modularity index = 0.393, z = 3.307, p = <0.001) with three clusters (fig. 1a) . the largest cluster (green nodes) included all of the protozoans, acute pathogens, and some fiv ple genotypes, whilst the remaining two clusters consisted just of fiv ple genotypes (fig. 1a) . while the high prevalence fiv ple genotypes clustered in the largest cluster, the b2, b3 and c2 genotypes clustered separately , and the disconnected c7 was only detected in one pride during the 1980s. the light red cluster is likely to result from the restricted distribution and temporal period in which these genotypes were identified (e.g., the north western region of the slp in the 1990's). the blue and green clusters, in contrast, included a variety of prides over the full sampling period (with the exception of b2 and b6, which were only detected in the woodlands in the 1980's). phylogenetically similar genotypes of fiv did not cluster 1 3 together (fig. s4 ). in contrast, the medium resolution network was completely nested with no modularity ( = 1, modularity index = 0, z = ∞ , p = 0) and no significant clusters (fig. 1b) .after accounting for environmental, individual and pride factors, the jsdm analysis identified strong associations between pathogens (fig. 2 ) that were not detected in the summary cooccurrence network. the nature of these interactions, however, was dependent on the scale assessed. at an individual and pride-year scale, we found strong associations between a small subset of acute and chronic pathogens. fiv ple b and h. felis were negatively associated with rvf (fig. 2) , and fiv ple b was also negatively associated with parvovirus ( fig. 2a/s5a ).however, this interaction could only be detected at medium taxonomic resolution. in contrast, at high taxonomic resolution, we identified positive interactions between b. gibsoni and rvf thatwere not detected at medium-resolution.the strongest associations between chronic and acute pathogens were detected at the lowest spatial-temporal resolution (landscape-year). in the high taxonomic resolution model, pathogens separated into two groups with each group having a very similar association profile. fiv ple c1 had a higher prevalence (fig. s6) , c1 had the same overall association profile as fiv ple c.associations between acute pathogens were rare. at the year-level, we detected positive associations between cdv and parvovirus with both pathogens negatively associated with calicivirus ( fig. 2c/s5c ). in contrast, associations between the chronic pathogens were common, but the nature of the interaction also differed at each taxonomic scale. for example, in the medium resolution model, we detected a positive association between h. felis and fiv ple c that was not found in the high-resolution model indicating that fiv ple subtype but not genotype was important for this association (fig. 2b/s5b ). strikingly, we found that fiv ple subtypes had contrasting association profiles. at the individual level, fiv ple b and c were negatively associated with each other and negatively and fiv ple c was positively associated with coronavirus whilst fiv ple b was negatively associated with coronavirus ( fig. 2a/s5a ). see fig. 3 for a summary of all of the associations detected across scales and figs. s7/8 for model details.here we demonstrate non-random pathogen interactions infecting wild african lions, with both facilitative and competitive associations detected between chronic and acute pathogens across different spatiotemporal scales. we found that whilst there was minimal structure in the summary co-occurrence network (fig. 1a) , we uncovered structure after accounting for scale and controlling for potentially confounding environmental and host variables (fig. 2) . the particular chronic pathogen an individual is infected by as a cub may have consequences for which acute pathogen the individual is infected with later in life (fig. 3) . moreover, we detected strong relationships between chronic pathogens across scales, and these associations may have 1 5consequences for lion health. we emphasize that the approach used here can start to untangle pathogen infra-community relationships and identify potential chronic-acute interactions in wild populations. these can then be compared with knowledge of pathogen pathogenesis and validated in-vitro in a laboratory setting. whilst clinical or laboratory studies of co-infection in lions are rare, the associations we found have clear precedence in similar pathogens co-infecting humans. our results not only provide new insights on disease dynamics in the serengeti lions but also provide a valuable framework for exploring pathogen co-occurrence networks and infracommunity dynamics across taxonomic and spatial scales.co-occurrence networks were highly nested with relatively low modularity, particularly at a medium taxonomic resolution. this contrasts with the more modular human parasite cooccurrence network (griffiths et al. 2014) . however, this is not surprising as the human networks included host resources and immune system components as nodes, and we lacked data the predicted stability (or otherwise) of our lion co-occurrence network is uncertain.theoretically, if such a strongly nested network were mostly mutualistic (i.e., pathogens facilitate other pathogens) if the prevalence of one pathogen decreased significantly due to 1 6 vaccination, for example, the overall structure would not alter (e.g., thebault & fontaine 2010).however, this may not hold for networks consisting of both positive and negative associations as found here (sauve et al. 2014) . conversely, the relatively low segregation in the lion network could mean that a perturbation would be less likely to be restricted to a particular compartment (griffiths et al. 2014) . we recommend further empirical and theoretical investigations on the consequences of nested or segregated networks on the stability of pathogen infra-communities.after accounting for environment and host effects, we found that the chronic pathogens were strongly associated with the acute pathogens across scales. for example, at an individual scale, chronic infections negatively interacted with rvf. coinfections between bunyaviruses like rvf and retroviruses are likely common in humans and wildlife, though there are surprisingly few studies addressing the topic. in contrast, relationships between dengue virus (a flavivirus) andhiv are relatively well understood. flaviviruses and hiv share similar immune receptors that can inhibit hiv replication and the molecular machinery used to do so maybe a viable way to control hiv infection (e.g., xiang et al. 2009 ). given the overall structural similarity of flaviviruses and bunyaviruses (hernandez et al. 2014) , it is possible that a similar mechanism underlies the association in lions between rvf and fiv ple that we observed, although we show that this association was subtype specific. if this was true, rvf may actually inhibit fiv ple b infection counter to our assumption that chronic pathogens in our system infected each individual first (fig. 3 ).relationships between acute and chronic pathogens were strongest at the year-landscape level.leading to mortality of nearly 40% of the lion population in 1994 (munson et al. 2008) . we found that all tick-borne hemoparasites showed potentially facilitative associations with cdv including b. leo (with insert) despite its low prevalence in 1993/4 (fig. s9 ) parvovirus was also positively associated with cdv, but this was likely due to similarities in epidemic cycles with a parvovirus epidemic in 1992 just before the 1994 cdv epidemic (packer et al. 1999) .parvoviruses are also immune suppressive, and so the timing of the parvovirus outbreak may also have contributed to the cdv/babesia-induced mortality. the general negative relationship between fiv ple c and cdv/babesia supports the theory that individuals infected by subtype c were more likely to die in the consequent babesia/cdv outbreak (troyer et al. 2011) . thus, this negative association may not be due to competition between pathogens but rather to mortality.our approach detected strong interactions between the chronic pathogens. for example, there were opposing associations between the fiv ple subtypes and coronavirus (fig. 2) . negative associations between retroviruses and coronaviruses are rarely reported, yet there are plausible molecular pathways. hiv-1 and human coronaviruses (hcov) share remarkably similar binding receptors (chan et al. 2006 ) and some mild hcov strains even considered a viable vaccine against hiv (eriksson et al. 2006) . this may explain the negative association we detected for fiv ple b and coronavirus but does not explain the positive association between fiv ple c and coronavirus we detected across scales. the mechanism driving fiv ple subtype specific relationships with coronaviruses are unclear, and as coronaviruses infecting lions are also likely 1 8to be genetically diverse, examining the genetic structure of coronavirus may help untangle these associations further. in contrast, competitive interactions between hiv strains are well characterized with hiv-1, for example, found to outcompete hiv-2 for blood resources (ariën et al. 2005) . for fiv ple , even though co-infection is relatively common (troyer et al. 2011) competition between subtypes could be important as there is anecdotal cell culture evidence that fiv ple b can propagate more rapidly than fiv ple c (melody roelke, unpublished data).there were also contrasting associations between the protozoan species. for example, the distribution of b. felis was not shaped by any other protozoan and in general, had a narrow association profile (fig.2) , unlike the other babesia species. for the individuals co-infected by protozoans, combinations involving b. felis were also common, whereas co-infections involving h. felis and the other babesia species varied in prevalence and composition (fig. s9) . even though b. gibsoni and b. felis show similar age prevalence profiles (fig. s1 ), the prevalence of b. felis over time was relatively stable compared to the other protozoa (fig. s10) . differences in the host range for individual babesia species and potential host differences in virulence may partially explain these patterns. for example, b. felis has only ever been detected in felids, whereas b. gibsoni has a much broader host range including canids (penzhorn 2006 ). more generalist pathogens may have greater pathogenicity as there can be reduced selective restraint on virulence particularly in 'dead end' hosts (woolhouse et al. 2001 ). if more pathogenic species are more likely to form significant associations with other pathogens compared to less virulentpathogens is an open question in disease ecology. importantly, patterns like these would be missed without incorporating high-resolution pathogen data.there are, however, limitations to this approach. the inability to distinguish mortality from competitive interactions is one of them, and careful interpretation of negative associations is necessary. incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underly candidate pathogen interactions (carver et al. 2015) could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies. another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely. for example, the negative association between rvf and h. felis could be due to differences in rainfall affecting vector abundance with higher rainfall years increase mosquito abundance thus increasing rvf prevalence (fig. s2 ). in contrast, low rainfall years increase the risk of lions being exposed to ticks (munson et al. 2008) thus potentially increasing h. felis prevalence. as rainfall was calibrated to the age of sampling rather than the age of infection (which could differ) the jsdm approach could not capture this variation. furthermore, we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density. also, the number of samples we had did differ across years (table s1 ) with most coming between 1985 and 1994, and this have influenced some patterns, particularly between genotypes. lastly, incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and jsdm analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure (griffiths et al. 2014) . however,given the daunting complexity of pathogen infra-community dynamics, our two-step approach can assess broad network structure and identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity.the high frequency of co-occurrence and co-infection in lions -and the potential for specific associations to cause population decline -highlights the importance of understanding pathogen 0 2 0 associations. the summary lion co-occurrence network is highly connected with both positive and negative associations between chronic and acute pathogens and altering the network could assist with disease control. for example, individuals vaccinated for both parvovirus and h. felis could potentially be at lower risk of babesia and cdv infection. conversely, our networks show that there could be unintended consequences of controlling a pathogen, as has been shown for deworming (fenton 2013) . for example, it is possible that vaccination targeting coronavirus in this population could increase b. gibsoni infections that may, in turn, lead to a higher risk of cdv exposure. whilst these relationships are correlative rather than mechanistic, it is clear from our study that relationships between microparasites are common and should be considered in disease management.our findings indicate that the lion's pathogen infra-community is complex, but interactions between pathogens are important. we identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity. more broadly, our work demonstrates how different network approaches can be combined to gain insights into the ecological factors underlying pathogen structures and interactions and how this can be applied to the study of pathogen communities of wildlife populations. in addition to these biological insights, the study highlights several critical areas for methodological improvement that can currently limit robust inference of pathogen interactions from time-series serological and qpcr data. addressing these limitations is timely, given the ongoing threat of wildlife populations decline, creating an urgent need to integrate better molecular, ecological and network information to guide strategies for disease control.2 8 protective immunity to blood-stage malaria by concurrent nematode infection. infect.imunity, 73, 3531-9.susi, h., barrès, b., vale, p.f., laine, a.-l., mideo, n., alizon, s., et al.

node colors reflect separate clusters.edge weights are proportional to the number of co-occurrences. identifying and determining the nature of species interactions of multiple pathogens within hosts is increasingly considered critical to understanding infectious disease dynamics (e.g., pedersen & fenton 2007; johnson et al. 2015; seabloom et al. 2015; fountain-jones et al. 2018) . individuals are often co-infected by a diverse infra-community of pathogens, and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection dynamics (cattadori et al. 2008; susi et al. 2015) and influence disease outcomes (moss et al. 2008; munson et al. 2008; wejse et al. 2015) . pathogens that form chronic, long-lasting infections are ubiquitous and are likely to overlap pathogens that produce short-lasting acute infections (fenton 2008; randall et al. 2013; rynkiewicz et al. 2015; aivelo & norberg 2018) . chronic pathogens can compete for the same resources as acute pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection (randall et al. 2013; budischak et al. 2018) or, conversely, facilitate infection via immune suppression (e.g., geldmacher & koup 2012) .interactions between chronic pathogens, such as between helminths and bacteria, are relatively well understood (e.g., ezenwa 2016), yet interactions between chronic and acute pathogens, particularly between microparasite species, are largely unknown. as humans, for example, are on average exposed to ten chronic and acute virus species alone (xu et al. 2015) , untangling the ecological interactions between microparasites represents a clear knowledge gap that has significant consequences for understanding pathogen dynamics (munson et al. 2008) .discriminating between positive or negative interactions between pathogens in populations is complicated by the short time window that an acute pathogen is shedding (and thus detectable with molecular methods) and by potentially confounding host environments (tompkins et al. 2011) . this is particularly the case for microparasites where pathogen detection often relies on serology, and, thus, without resampling the same individual, the precise timing of exposure cannot be estimated. detection of chronic pathogens may be more straightforward as the infection is active for more extended periods, but deducing pathogen interactions is difficult without extensive longitudinal data (tompkins et al. 2011; fenton et al. 2014) . identifying whether two pathogens interact due to host-habitat preferences, the increasing likelihood of exposure with age, or infra-community processes such as competition is methodologically challenging (poulin 2007; johnson & buller 2011; fenton et al. 2014; clark et al. 2016) .further, competition between pathogens could result in increased mortality associated with a particular combination of pathogens (su et al. 2005) .detecting interactions between pathogens is also likely to depend on taxonomic and spatial scales that are seldom considered (stutz et al. 2018) . studies commonly aggregate pathogen data to genus level, but interactions between pathogens can be subtype or genotype-specific (e.g., wejse et al. 2015; benesh & kalbe 2016; brook et al. 2017) . for example, individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 (hiv-1) are four times more likely to become coinfected with tuberculosis compared to individuals with hiv-2 (wejse et al. 2015) . beyond subtype or genus, genotype-specific associations have been demonstrated in snails infected by trematodes (louhi et al. 2015) and in rodents infected by bartonella bacteria (brook et al. 2017 ).infra-community dynamics are also likely to vary with spatiotemporal scale. for example, pathogen associations in amphibian communities differed substantially at the host scale compared to the pond scale, but these effects can be reversed or undetected at other scales (stutz et al. 2018) . in general, interactions between free-living species are more apparent at scales 7 7 although pathogen co-occurrence networks are valuable for quantifying broad structural patterns, they do not account for environmental or host factors or differences in spatial or temporal scale. joint species distribution models fill this gap by simultaneously assessing environmental influences and interspecific co-occurrences across multiple scales using hierarchical bayesian mixed models (warton et al. 2015; ovaskainen et al. 2017 ). here we use both co-occurrence network and joint species distribution models to examine the structure of pathogen-pathogen networks and quantify pathogen associations whilst controlling for environmental and host factors. we collate ten years of data on acute and chronic pathogens in 105 african lions (panthera leo) as well as extensive host and environmental data from the serengeti lion project (slp, packer et al. 2005) . the slp datasets provides a unique opportunity to understand pathogen co-occurrence networks in a wild population whilst controlling for group, individual and environmental characteristics. we use this data to ask the following interlinked questions:to what degree is the co-occurrence network of pathogens in serengeti lions nested or segregated?(ii) after accounting for environmental and host factors, is the type of chronic infection an individual is infected by associated with subsequent exposure to an acute pathogen? are there important chronic-chronic or acute-acute pathogen cooccurrence patterns?we view co-occurrence at two levels of taxonomic resolution and across spatiotemporal scales.we describe a step-analytical pathway that can assess broad network structure and quantify . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. it . https://doi.org/10.1101/370841 doi: biorxiv preprint pathogen interactions across multiple scales that can generally be applied to infectious disease dynamics. detecting pathogen co-occurrence patterns not only provides novel insights into pathogen infra-community dynamics but also helps aide surveillance efforts and generates testable hypotheses that can be answered in laboratory experiments.serological testing and quantitative pcr (qpcr) was performed to detect acute and chronic pathogens from blood samples taken from lions in the serengeti national park, tanzania from 1984-1994. in total, 394 individuals were sampled throughout this period, but our analysis was restricted to the 105 individuals tested for the full suite of pathogens (see table 1 for pathogen natural history and table s1 for the number of individuals tested per year included in the analyses). nomadic individuals (i.e. lions that were not resident in any pride) were excluded due to the difficulty of assigning environmental variables (see confounding variables below).serological data for canine distemper virus (cdv), feline calicivirus, parvovirus, and coronavirus has been published previously (packer et al. 1999 but see table s2 for assay details), with the exception of rift valley fever (rvf). to detect rvf exposure we conducted a plaque reduction virus neutralizing test (prnt) that quantified virus neutralizing antibodies from serum as per the scott et al. (1986) protocol. anthrax (bacilus anthracis) and feline herpes virus were excluded from analysis because all lions were seropositive (packer et al. 1999; lembo et al. 2011) . similarly, feline leukemia virus (felv) was also excluded because al lions were seronegative (hofmann-lehmann et al. 1996) .we used qpcr for identification of nucleotides for feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv ple ) and the protozoan pathogens in this study (table 1) . three distinct subtypes of fiv ple co-circulate in . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a the copyright holder for this

2008 ) and thus subtype specific qpcr was performed (see troyer et al. 2004 troyer et al. , 2005 for qpcr protocols). the resultant 300 base pair sequences from the pol gene were aligned and assigned to 21 operational taxonomic units/genotypes based on a 95% molecular similarity threshold (see fountain-jones et al. 2017 for details). lions also commonly get chronically infected by a rich protozoan fauna including babesia and hepatazoon genera. we developed quantitative pcr protocols using density gel gradient electrophoresis to identify each protozoan species (see munson et al. 2008) .we categorized each pathogen as chronic or acute based on the literature and, as the biology of most of these pathogens in lions are poorly understood, age-prevalence relationships. pathogens which peak in prevalence at a young age (<= 2 y.o.) with little temporal fluctuation were considered to be chronic, whereas an increasing age-prevalence relationship and high temporal variation were classified as more acute (fig. s1 ). feline coronavirus can have both acute and chronic forms and it is impossible to assess which form the individual was exposed to from serological data, but based on age-prevalence relationships we categorized it as a chronic infection (fig. s1 ). as most individual lions were likely to be infected by chronic infections within the first two years after birth (troyer et al. 2011, fig . s1), we assume that acute exposure typically occurred whilst the individual was infected by the chronic pathogen. we then partitioned the chronic pathogen data into two sets based on taxonomic resolution (high and medium). the high taxonomic resolution dataset encompassed fiv ple genotype and babesia species data, whereas the medium resolution dataset aggregated fiv ple subtype information and babesia data to genus level. we created a summary co-occurrence matrix (n*n) (griffiths et al. 2014) that described the amount of co-occurrence of both chronic and acute pathogens within individuals by multiplying the incidence matrix (i.e., contingency table that described the occurrence of pathogens across individuals) by its transpose. we then computed a measure ( ) of network structure and modularity index based on node overlap and segregation (strona & veech 2015) .is scaled from -1 to 1, where -1 represents an entirely segregated network and 1 represents an entirely nested network.the co-occurrence matrix was also used to evaluate preferential associations among pathogens the co-occurrence matrix was obtained from the incidence matrix using the graph.incidence and the bipartite.projection functions. the classification analysis was performed using the fastgreedy.community function and graphical output were produced using the tkplot function in igraph.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a we fitted joint species distribution models (jdsm) for both high and medium taxonomic resolution datasets, combining information on environmental and host covariates (see confounding variables below for details), to the occurrence data for each of the pathogens.pathogens detected fewer than five times were excluded from this analysis. we fitted all the jsdms with bayesian inference, using "hierarchical modelling of species communities" ("hmsc" blanchet et al. 2018) . for each analysis, we modeled the response pathogen coexposure matrix using a probit model. in each model we added individual, pride-year (i.e., which pride and year the individual was sampled in) and year sampled as random effects. we utilized the default priors of the framework (described in full detail in ovaskainen et al. 2017) and ran the hmsc model twice using 3 million mcmc samples (the first 300 000 of which being burnin). each run was carried out using a different seed. visual inspection of mcmc traces were performed to assess convergence. in addition, we made sure that the effective sample size (ess) of each parameter was > 200.as part of the slp, most of the individuals in this study have been regularly observed since birth (mosser & packer 2009). we selected 13 predictor variables that we thought were likely to be important for pathogen exposure and thus could confound possible interaction patterns (table 2 ). we included variables that captured individual variability (e.g., age at sampling), and pride characteristics including environmental variables (e.g., average vegetation cover of the pride's territory; see table 2 for measurement details). we attempted to calibrate each predictor set based on possible epidemic year (e.g., calculating rainfall for the year the individual was co-infected by the acute pathogen) as determined by packer et al. (1999) ,the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. it . https://doi.org/10.1101/370841 doi: biorxiv preprint 1 2 however this removed a large number of males from the dataset as their natal pride were unknown and this reduced the power of our analyses.not including anthrax and herpes (to which all individuals had been exposed), the serengeti lions were exposed to an average of 5 pathogens (two acute and three chronic, sd = 1) with one individual had been infected by 9 of 10 pathogens (based on medium resolution data, fig. s3 ).remarkably, cubs between 1 and 2 y.o. had been already infected with an average of 4 pathogens (sd = 1) with one 1.5 y.o cub positive for 5. all lions were qpcr positive for at least one protozoan species, and 25% of them were infected by all four considered.the high taxonomic resolution summary network indicated a significantly nested architecture ( = 0.74) with relatively low modularity (modularity index = 0.393, z = 3.307, p = <0.001) with three clusters (fig. 1a) . the largest cluster (green nodes) included all of the protozoans, acute pathogens, and some fiv ple genotypes, whilst the remaining two clusters consisted just of fiv ple genotypes (fig. 1a) . while the high prevalence fiv ple genotypes clustered in the largest cluster, the b2, b3 and c2 genotypes clustered separately , and the disconnected c7 was only detected in one pride during the 1980s. the light red cluster is likely to result from the restricted distribution and temporal period in which these genotypes were identified (e.g., the north western region of the slp in the 1990's). the blue and green clusters, in contrast, included a variety of prides over the full sampling period (with the exception of b2 and b6, which were only detected in the woodlands in the 1980's). phylogenetically similar genotypes of fiv did not cluster . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a the copyright holder for

overall association profile as fiv ple c.associations between acute pathogens were rare. at the year-level, we detected positive associations between cdv and parvovirus with both pathogens negatively associated with calicivirus ( fig. 2c/s5c ). in contrast, associations between the chronic pathogens were common, but the nature of the interaction also differed at each taxonomic scale. for example, in the medium resolution model, we detected a positive association between h. felis and fiv ple c that was not found in the high-resolution model indicating that fiv ple subtype but not genotype was important for this association (fig. 2b/s5b ). strikingly, we found that fiv ple subtypes had contrasting association profiles. at the individual level, fiv ple b and c were negatively associated with each other and negatively and fiv ple c was positively associated with coronavirus whilst fiv ple b was negatively associated with coronavirus ( fig. 2a/s5a ). see fig. 3 for a summary of all of the associations detected across scales and figs. s7/8 for model details.here we demonstrate non-random pathogen interactions infecting wild african lions, with both facilitative and competitive associations detected between chronic and acute pathogens across different spatiotemporal scales. we found that whilst there was minimal structure in the summary co-occurrence network (fig. 1a) , we uncovered structure after accounting for scale and controlling for potentially confounding environmental and host variables (fig. 2) . the particular chronic pathogen an individual is infected by as a cub may have consequences for which acute pathogen the individual is infected with later in life (fig. 3) . moreover, we detected strong relationships between chronic pathogens across scales, and these associations may have . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. it . https://doi.org/10.1101/370841 doi: biorxiv preprint 1 5 consequences for lion health. we emphasize that the approach used here can start to untangle pathogen infra-community relationships and identify potential chronic-acute interactions in wild populations. these can then be compared with knowledge of pathogen pathogenesis and validated in-vitro in a laboratory setting. whilst clinical or laboratory studies of co-infection in lions are rare, the associations we found have clear precedence in similar pathogens co-infecting humans. our results not only provide new insights on disease dynamics in the serengeti lions but also provide a valuable framework for exploring pathogen co-occurrence networks and infracommunity dynamics across taxonomic and spatial scales.co-occurrence networks were highly nested with relatively low modularity, particularly at a medium taxonomic resolution. this contrasts with the more modular human parasite co- the predicted stability (or otherwise) of our lion co-occurrence network is uncertain.theoretically, if such a strongly nested network were mostly mutualistic (i.e., pathogens facilitate other pathogens) if the prevalence of one pathogen decreased significantly due to . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. it . https://doi.org/10.1101/370841 doi: biorxiv preprint 1 6 vaccination, for example, the overall structure would not alter (e.g., thebault & fontaine 2010).however, this may not hold for networks consisting of both positive and negative associations as found here (sauve et al. 2014) . conversely, the relatively low segregation in the lion network could mean that a perturbation would be less likely to be restricted to a particular compartment (griffiths et al. 2014) . we recommend further empirical and theoretical investigations on the consequences of nested or segregated networks on the stability of pathogen infra-communities.after accounting for environment and host effects, we found that the chronic pathogens were strongly associated with the acute pathogens across scales. for example, at an individual scale, chronic infections negatively interacted with rvf. coinfections between bunyaviruses like rvf and retroviruses are likely common in humans and wildlife, though there are surprisingly few studies addressing the topic. in contrast, relationships between dengue virus (a flavivirus) andhiv are relatively well understood. flaviviruses and hiv share similar immune receptors that can inhibit hiv replication and the molecular machinery used to do so maybe a viable way to control hiv infection (e.g., xiang et al. 2009 ). given the overall structural similarity of flaviviruses and bunyaviruses (hernandez et al. 2014) , it is possible that a similar mechanism underlies the association in lions between rvf and fiv ple that we observed, although we show that this association was subtype specific. if this was true, rvf may actually inhibit fiv ple b infection counter to our assumption that chronic pathogens in our system infected each individual first (fig. 3) .. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. it . https://doi.org/10.1101/370841 doi: biorxiv preprint 1 7relationships between acute and chronic pathogens were strongest at the year-landscape level.leading to mortality of nearly 40% of the lion population in 1994 (munson et al. 2008) . we found that all tick-borne hemoparasites showed potentially facilitative associations with cdv including b. leo (with insert) despite its low prevalence in 1993/4 (fig. s9 ) parvovirus was also positively associated with cdv, but this was likely due to similarities in epidemic cycles with a parvovirus epidemic in 1992 just before the 1994 cdv epidemic (packer et al. 1999) .parvoviruses are also immune suppressive, and so the timing of the parvovirus outbreak may also have contributed to the cdv/babesia-induced mortality. the general negative relationship between fiv ple c and cdv/babesia supports the theory that individuals infected by subtype c were more likely to die in the consequent babesia/cdv outbreak (troyer et al. 2011) . thus, this negative association may not be due to competition between pathogens but rather to mortality.our approach detected strong interactions between the chronic pathogens. for example, there were opposing associations between the fiv ple subtypes and coronavirus (fig. 2) to be genetically diverse, examining the genetic structure of coronavirus may help untangle these associations further. in contrast, competitive interactions between hiv strains are well characterized with hiv-1, for example, found to outcompete hiv-2 for blood resources (ariën et al. 2005) . for fiv ple , even though co-infection is relatively common (troyer et al. 2011) competition between subtypes could be important as there is anecdotal cell culture evidence that fiv ple b can propagate more rapidly than fiv ple c (melody roelke, unpublished data).there were also contrasting associations between the protozoan species. for example, the distribution of b. felis was not shaped by any other protozoan and in general, had a narrow association profile (fig.2) , unlike the other babesia species. for the individuals co-infected by protozoans, combinations involving b. felis were also common, whereas co-infections involving h. felis and the other babesia species varied in prevalence and composition (fig. s9) . even though b. gibsoni and b. felis show similar age prevalence profiles (fig. s1 ), the prevalence of b. felis over time was relatively stable compared to the other protozoa (fig. s10) . differences in the host range for individual babesia species and potential host differences in virulence may partially explain these patterns. for example, b. felis has only ever been detected in felids, whereas b. gibsoni has a much broader host range including canids (penzhorn 2006 ). more generalist pathogens may have greater pathogenicity as there can be reduced selective restraint on virulence particularly in 'dead end' hosts (woolhouse et al. 2001 ). if more pathogenic species are more likely to form significant associations with other pathogens compared to less virulentpathogens is an open question in disease ecology. importantly, patterns like these would be missed without incorporating high-resolution pathogen data.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. it . https://doi.org/10.1101/370841 doi: biorxiv preprint 1 9there are, however, limitations to this approach. the inability to distinguish mortality from competitive interactions is one of them, and careful interpretation of negative associations is necessary. incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underly candidate pathogen interactions (carver et al. 2015) could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies. another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely. for example, the negative association between rvf and h. felis could be due to differences in rainfall affecting vector abundance with higher rainfall years increase mosquito abundance thus increasing rvf prevalence (fig. s2 ). in contrast, low rainfall years increase the risk of lions being exposed to ticks (munson et al. 2008) thus potentially increasing h. felis prevalence. as rainfall was calibrated to the age of sampling rather than the age of infection (which could differ) the jsdm approach could not capture this variation. furthermore, we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density. also, the number of samples we had did differ across years (table s1 ) with most coming between 1985 and 1994, and this have influenced some patterns, particularly between genotypes. lastly, incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and jsdm analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure (griffiths et al. 2014) . however, given the daunting complexity of pathogen infra-community dynamics, our two-step approach can assess broad network structure and identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity.the high frequency of co-occurrence and co-infection in lions -and the potential for specific associations to cause population decline -highlights the importance of understanding pathogen . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. it . https://doi.org/10.1101/370841 doi: biorxiv preprint 0 2 0 associations. the summary lion co-occurrence network is highly connected with both positive and negative associations between chronic and acute pathogens and altering the network could assist with disease control. for example, individuals vaccinated for both parvovirus and h. felis could potentially be at lower risk of babesia and cdv infection. conversely, our networks show that there could be unintended consequences of controlling a pathogen, as has been shown for deworming (fenton 2013). for example, it is possible that vaccination targeting coronavirus in this population could increase b. gibsoni infections that may, in turn, lead to a higher risk of cdv exposure. whilst these relationships are correlative rather than mechanistic, it is clear from our study that relationships between microparasites are common and should be considered in disease management.our findings indicate that the lion's pathogen infra-community is complex, but interactions between pathogens are important. we identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity. more broadly, our work demonstrates how different network approaches can be combined to gain insights into the ecological factors underlying pathogen structures and interactions and how this can be applied to the study of pathogen communities of wildlife populations. in addition to these biological insights, the study highlights several critical areas for methodological improvement that can currently limit robust inference of pathogen interactions from time-series serological and qpcr data. addressing these limitations is timely, given the ongoing threat of wildlife populations decline, creating an urgent need to integrate better molecular, ecological and network information to guide strategies for disease control..

https://doi.org/10.1101/370841 doi: biorxiv preprinteven if a safe and effective vaccine shall be marketed in months, vaccination against covid-19 may fall into long-term guerrilla warfare between sars-cov-2 and humans. first, after the pandemic, covid-19 could be as mild as human diseases caused by other human coronaviruses, or as severe as the coronavirus diseases in swine, chicken, feline, and murine which are all more burdensome than influenza. 3 second, sars-cov-2 could escape vaccination through its rapid mutation including site substitutions, genomic recombination, and open reading frame shift. 4 third, sars-cov-2 could move swiftly through the movement of infected people, and hide in some people for weeks without symptoms. 5 fourth, the hidden sars-cov-2 could attack unpredictably susceptible humans who have not been infected or vaccinated, or have no sustainable immunity induced by the infection or vaccination, or have innate or acquired immunodeficiency.vaccination could accelerate the mutation of viruses through natural selection, and sars-cov-2 could diverge into distinct lineages through its rapid mutation, both of which could escalate the guerrilla warfare between sars-cov-2 and humans.accordingly, the vaccine should be updated promptly to match the mutated virus, and multiple vaccine strains or antigens should be used to match major diversified lineages of the virus. the vaccination, update of the vaccine, and addition of vaccine strains or antigens could be all highly burdensome. difficulty in vaccine development, rapid mutation of coronaviruses, long-term guerrilla warfare between viruses and humans, and heavy disease burden have been demonstrated in animal coronavirus diseases. 3 the above information suggests that elimination of sars-cov-2 through vaccination to avoid the potential long-term costly guerrilla warfare, if possible, is highly desired and worth extensive discussion and intensive consideration. moreover, this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.the elimination initiative is inspired by the interesting history that multiple influenza viruses have been eliminated through natural pandemics or mass vaccination, as explained below.during the past seven decades, three human influenza viruses (huivs) disappeared coincidently with emergence of three influenza pandemics. 7 first, the h1n1 subtype huiv, which circulated in humans for many years before 1957, disappeared during the pandemic of h2n2 subtype huivs emerging in 1957. second, the above h2n2 subtype huiv, which circulated for approximately ten years after 1957, disappeared during the pandemic of h3n2 subtype huiv emerging in 1968.third, the h1n1 subtype huiv, which circulated after its re-emergence in 1977, disappeared during the pandemic of swine-origin h1n1 subtype huiv emerging indisappearance of the above three huivs can be explained only by the broad and strong herd immunity induced by the relevant pandemic viruses, in statistics and in biology. 7 this means that the pandemics provided natural, rapid, global, and highly effective vaccination which eliminated the three huivs having circulated in humans for years. the pandemic viruses harbored multiple genes from the eliminated viruses, or shared the same ha and na subtypes with the eliminated viruses (table 1 ). 8 they thus shared various t and/or b cell epitopes with the eliminated viruses, and so the immunity induced by the pandemic viruses exerted the elimination effect.the above elimination events demonstrated that the pandemic viruses, although disastrous, induced broader and stronger herd immunity than commercial influenza vaccines which could reduce infections caused by limited clades of huivs within the same ha subtype.the pandemic of swine-origin h1n1 huiv in 2009 did not eliminate the h3n2 subtype huiv which has circulated since 1968, possibly because these two viruses did not harbor any genomic segments (table 1) , although the pb1 gene of the pandemic virus was from h3n2 subtype huivs circulating approximately ten years before 2009, 8 and they thus shared less t and/or b cell epitopes. in 1977, the h1n1 huiv this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.which circulated in the 1950s re-emerged worldwide possibly due to a laboratory incident, and most infected people were under 23 who had not encountered the h1n1 huiv before 1977. 9 therefore, re-emergence of the h1n1 huiv induced lower herd immunity than the above pandemics, and thus did not eliminate the above h3n2 huiv either.deliberate vaccination has also eliminated an aiv. 10 the mechanism of elimination of the three huivs and two aivs is that strong immunity was induced in almost all susceptible hosts in affected areas against the targeted virus through natural or deliberate vaccination in a relatively short time, 14 and the established herd immunity blocked the circulation of a targeted virus completely. these events indicate that elimination of covid-19, which is also a respiratory infectious disease caused by an rna virus, is possible and should be based on rapid establishment of global herd immunity through mass vaccination.theoretically, the coming two years is the golden time for elimination of sars-cov-2 through vaccination, because sars-cov-2 shall likely have not diversified into distinct lineages during this period, and thus one vaccine strain or antigen could match all lineages of sars-cov-2 circulating worldwide. 6 moreover, many people shall have been infected in the coming months by sars-cov-2, which aids to establish strong herd immunity for the elimination.elimination of covid-19 through vaccination should be a great project requiring tremendous national and international collaboration (figure 1) , and the elimination project is of the vital interests of all countries as it saves much money and many lives for all countries. moreover, most people in the world have known the risk of covid-19 and could actively aid or involve the elimination. china government has pledged to donate two billion usd to the world to fight covid-19, and such donations could support strongly this elimination project. we assessed preliminarily that the benefit/cost ratio of the elimination could be over ten, because the elimination this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.through vaccination required about three-fold efforts for common vaccination in a year, and the elimination could remove over 30 years of heavy burden caused by . even if the disease has not been eliminated through tremendous efforts, the elimination efforts should remain highly valuable because it could be beneficial for better control of the disease.the relevant international cooperation mechanism should be established for the global elimination project. all countries should collaborate with unprecedented solidarity to fully discuss this issue, rationally design the route map, and actively deploy resources to implement the project. lessons and experiences of the past in vaccination against other viral infectious diseases should be well considered in the project design.the vaccine for the elimination project should be carefully selected. the vaccine should be safe, effective, inexpensive, rapid in production, easy for storage, and convenient for vaccination, but few vaccines meet all these requirements. 2 table 2 shows presumed advantages and disadvantages of major types of vaccines with exceptions (e.g. some live attenuated vaccines including those for poliomyelitis and mumps are safe for use). 15 critically, sometimes higher vaccine efficacy means lower safety risk due to lower morbidity. for example, vaccine b should be superior to vaccine a, if vaccine a is of 100% safety and reduces symptomatic covid-19 cases by 60% from 5.0% to 2.0% of the vaccinated population, and vaccine b reduces symptomatic cases caused by natural infection by 100%, although 0.2% of the people inoculated with vaccine b become symptomatic covid-19 cases caused by the vaccine. moreover, almost all the few vaccine-associated cases can be cured, like that 99.84% of the cases in china beyond the province hubei, who were treated timely, successfully recovered. 16 therefore, unlike the vaccines for rabies and polio, efficacy of covid-19 vaccines could be prioritized. codon-modification could reduce the pathogenesis rapidly, but whether the lav can be generated and propagate efficiently in cells is of concern because it employs many rare codons. 2 considering that lavs are of multiple potential advantages and various successful applications, more types of lavs should be developed for covid-19.the elimination history of the three huivs suggests that lpv can induce broad and strong immunity, because the relevant pandemic influenza viruses could be considered as lpvs which eliminated the relevant huivs. the lpv strategy has been applied successfully in the usa military recruits for nearly 40 years to control acute respiratory diseases caused by types 4 and 7 adenoviruses, and reduced the morbidity by over 99%. 18 it avoids causing disease through oral administration of enteric-coated capsules containing the lpv to bypass the pathogenic site of the fragile lungs. 19 beyond inducing broad and strong immunity, lpvs are of no concern about pathogenic reversion and inhibit indirectly the mutation and diversification of the targeted virus through replacing various virus mutants circulating in vaccinated regions. 20 although the safety of the lpv strategy is a big public concern, the safety has been well guaranteed in the lpv of adenovirus used in the usa military recruits, and can be further guaranteed with novel measures. 20 detailed plans should be formulated to guide the global elimination project. over half people worldwide should be vaccinated in a relatively short time to establish the strong herd immunity. considering the rate of the vaccine production and risk factors of covid-19, elderly people and healthcare workers should be vaccinated first. 21 the this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.mass vaccination is favorably conducted in warm or hot seasons when the prevalence of many infectious viruses including covid-19 is lower and human immunity is higher than in cold seasons. 22 moreover, epidemiological monitoring system should be well designed and established to identify potential problems associated with the global elimination project, and scientific solutions to these problems should be prepared in advance.if successful, this global elimination project could pave the road for elimination of some other viral infectious diseases. it shall also greatly enhance global solidarity which is the core fortune of mankind. influenza a virus (iav), a member of the genus orthomyxovirus, causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in avian species and mammals [1] . except for influenza h17 and h18 viruses that originated from bats, the waterfowl are known as a primordial reservoir for all subtypes of iav [1, 2] . unlike human influenza viruses, avian influenza (ai) viruses are classified into two pathotypes-low pathogenic avian influenza (lpai) and hpai-based on the pathogenicity in chickens and molecular determinants of the multibasic cleavage site motif in the hemagglutinin (ha) protein [3, 4] . during the circulation of hpai virus subtypes h5nx and h7nx in poultry, they proved to be highly pathogenic with mortality of up to 100%. sporadically, the h5n1 hpai viruses cross the species barrier into humans. according to the who report [5] , different subtypes of h5 hpai viruses pose a substantial threat to global health with high mortality rate and huge economic burden to poultry farms.outbreaks of h5nx hpai viruses in poultry are increasing, and numerous clades of h5nx hpai have been classified since the first detection of the goose/guangdong (gs/gd) h5n1 hpai virus in china [6] . however, the gs/gd viruses and other iavs have reassorted and diversified into 10 separate clades with more than 30 classified higher-order clades identified so far [7] . in particular, among the reassortment of novel h5nx hpai viruses, 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.4 clades of h5 hpai viruses have become endemic in poultry populations in asian countries, such as china, vietnam, and south korea [8, 9] . the novel h5nx viruses have reassorted with different na subtypes, such as h5n2, h5n5, h5n6, and h5n8, in poultry and migratory birds [10] . the interaction between poultry and migratory wild birds and the complex overlapping flyways contribute to their long distance virus transmission [11] . the [12] . in addition, there was an outbreak of the h5 clade 2.3.4.4 virus around the east asian-australasian and american flyways in recent years [13] [14] [15] . furthermore, these lineage viruses with different antigenic properties have been cocirculating. thus, rapid and highly accurate methods are necessary for the detection of h5 hpai viruses and clade identification.molecular diagnostic methods are used as the first step in the identification and control of the iav outbreaks. thus, a number of molecular methods, such as dna microarrays [16] , loop-mediated isothermal amplification tests [17] , and restriction fragment mass analysis [18] , have been developed and applied for rapid ha subtyping of the iav field isolates [19] . among these methods, rt-qpcr has been implemented in most reference diagnostics laboratories for the detection and characterization of iavs. these diagnostic techniques were developed and used for subtyping or sequencing of novel viruses. however, due to the continuous circulation of h5nx hpai and other virus clades in avian species, it is very difficult to control viral transmission in poultry [3] . to effectively control and rapidly diagnose suspected infection on poultry farms, it is important to develop a rapid diagnostic assay for the simultaneous detection of different h5 hpai viruses [20] .in this study, we tested our one-step multiplex method using clinical poultry samples to simultaneously detect pan-hpai and two h5 clades. thus, our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay can be used for the screening of virus-infected field samples.a total of 15 reference influenza virus samples were obtained from the korea research institute of bioscience and biotechnology (kribb) and national vietnam university of agriculture. coronavirus-229e and parainfluenza virus 1 were purchased from the korea bank for pathogenic viruses. newcastle disease virus (vn1) and infectious bronchitis virus (vnua3) were kindly supported by dr. le van phan (national vietnam university of agriculture). all the reference influenza viruses were propagated in the allantoic fluid of 9-11 days old embryonated specific pathogen-free chicken eggs. all h5 hpai experiments were conducted in a biosafety level 3 containment facility in kribb and biosafety level 2 plus facilities at the college of veterinary medicine, vietnam national university of agriculture, hanoi, vietnam. field samples obtained from 12 farms in vietnam were taken from domestic chickens with signs of respiratory illness in 2016 to 2018. for the screening of influenza positive field samples, all filed samples were analyzed using m-gene-specific rt-qpcr according to the who manual on animal influenza diagnosis and surveillance [21] , and only m-gene positive field samples were used in the present study.to detect the pan-h5 hpai-specific and hpai clade-specific probes, h5nx ha gene sequences of 1018 low pathogenic and 4301 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from the genbank database of the national center for biotechnology information or influenza research database (ird, www.fludb.org) were analyzed, and complementary sequences were designed using clustalw in bioedit software (7.2 version) to identify conserved regions. the all amplicons obtained using one set of ha primers were 201 base pairs in length.to assess the reaction efficiency and limit of detection of our multiplex qpcr assay, viral h5-ha gene was synthesized using the full-length h5-ha gene sequence from a/environment/korea/w150/2006 for hpai detection, a/environment/korea/w541/2016 for clade 2.3.4.4 detection, or a/wild bird/jiangsu/h184/2015 for clade 2.3.2.1 detection and cloned using the mighty ta cloning kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. after cloning, each h5-ha gene plasmid insertion was confirmed by dna sequencing analysis. for the determination of limit of detection, one-step multiplex qpcr assays were performed using a serial 10-fold dilution (5 × 10 8 to 5 × 10 0 copies of plasmid dna/µl) of each plasmid; each qpcr assay was performed in triplicate. the plasmid copy number was calculated using the uri genomics & sequencing center program (http://cels.uri.edu/gsc/cndna.html).for the one-step multiplex rt-qpcr, viral rna was extracted using the rneasy mini kit (hilden, germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. the rt-qpcr assays were performed using the lightcycler 96 instrument and software (1.1 version). the one-step multiplex rt-qpcr reaction mixture contained 0.8 µl of enzyme mixture, 4 µl of 5× reaction buffer, 0.8 µl of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (10 pmol) from a qiagen (hilden, germany) one-step rt-qpcr kit, 1 µl of each primer (10 pmol), 1 µl of each probe (5 µm), 3 µl rna template and rnase-free water so that the final reaction volume reached 20 µl. the pcr thermocycling procedure was performed at 50 • c for 30 min and 94 • c for 10 min for the reverse transcription step; the next step was performed at 94 • c for 20 s, 56 • c for 20 s, and 72 • c for 30 s for 40 cycles. fluorescence data were acquired during the annealing step to distinguish the positive and negative results. the rt-qpcr positive reaction of ct value was set to 35 and rnase-free water was used as a negative control.specificity of our multiplex rt-qpcr system was evaluated with different influenza virus and other avian/human pathogens. total viral rna samples from 1 human influenza virus (h1n1 subtype), 11 avian influenza viruses (h1n1, h3n3, h5n1, h5n2, h5n6, h5n8, h7n1, h9n2, and h10n1 subtype), 1 equine influenza virus (h3n8 subtype), 1 canine influenza virus (h3n2), 1 swine influenza virus (h3n2 subtype), avian infectious bronchitis virus, newcastle disease virus, human coronavirus-229e, and human parainfluenza were assessed using one-step multiplex rt-qpcr described in this study.all h5 hpai-positive field samples were identified by conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and the ha gene was amplified using the following primer set: forward 5 -gcattggytaycatgcaaaya-3 and reverse 5 -ttgctrtggtgrtayccataca-3 . specific amplicons were purified from 1.5% agarose gels using a qiaquick gel extraction kit (hilden, germany) and sequenced using an abi prism 3730 dna sequencer. the sequences were compiled and edited using the bioedit program (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html). based on their sequences, all h5 hpai-positive field viruses were classified as the h5 hpai clade using highly pathogenic h5n1 clade classification tool in the influenza research database.to develop the one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay, a specific primer set and the probes for pan-h5 hpai and two clades, 2.3.4.4 or 2.3.2.1, were designed. in order to enhance the simultaneous detection specificity of a target gene, the h5 hpai ha gene sequences from different years and various clades of h5 hpai strains were downloaded from the genbank database; primers and probes for the most conserved regions of the ha gene ( figure 1 ) were designed. to optimize our one-step multiplex qpcr, three ha gene plasmids, containing the h5 hpai ha genes of two clades, were amplified and used as a quantitative standard in our system. each plasmid was serially diluted (5 × 10 8 to 5 × 10 0 copies per microliter), and the sensitivity of our primer/probe set was determined using the singleplex and multiplex qpcr assays targeting pan-h5 hpai, clade 2.3.4.4, or 2.3.2.1. the standard curves, generated for these targets under both qpcr conditions, showed linearity (r 2 = 0.9918 to 0.9997, figure 2 ). also, we showed that the detection limit under both qpcr conditions was 5 × 10 1 copies per microliter ( table 1 ). the cut-off for the cycle threshold of rt-qpcr was set to 35. forward 5′-gcattggytaycatgcaaaya-3′ and reverse 5′-ttgctrtggtgrtayccataca-3′. specific amplicons were purified from 1.5% agarose gels using a qiaquick gel extraction kit (hilden, germany) and sequenced using an abi prism 3730 dna sequencer. the sequences were compiled and edited using the bioedit program (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html). based on their sequences, all h5 hpai-positive field viruses were classified as the h5 hpai clade using highly pathogenic h5n1 clade classification tool in the influenza research database.to develop the

we showed that the detection limit under both qpcr conditions was 5 × 10 1 copies per microliter ( table 1 ). the cut-off for the cycle threshold of rt-qpcr was set to 35. each concentration had triple replicates and the mean and sd were conducted using graphpad prism software (version 5.1). to assess analytical specificity of the one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay, strains of different subtypes or clades of influenza a virus, as well as other avian or human origin viruses, infectious bronchitis virus, newcastle disease virus, coronavirus-229e strain, and parainfluenza virus 1, were tested. as we expected, all h5 hpai and two clade viruses were successfully detected, while the other influenza a virus subtypes and viruses of other origin were not amplified by our multiplex rt-qpcr (table 2 ). in addition, the h5 lpai subtype viruses were not detected using our specific h5 hpai primer/probe set. interestingly, although the h5n1 hpai subtypes of a/environment/korea/w150/2006 (clade 2.2) and a/duck/vietnam/ncvd-1648/2012 (clade 2.3.2.1) are the same, our primer/probe set detected only clade 2.3.2.1. these results show that our multiplex rt-qpcr assay is highly specific and exhibits no cross-reactivity for h5 hpai and the other clades. to assess analytical specificity of the one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay, strains of different subtypes or clades of influenza a virus,

cross-reactivity for h5 hpai and the other clades. to detect h5 hpai in fecal samples using our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay, we obtained a total of 4350 fecal samples from domestic chickens with signs of respiratory illness in vietnam, and viral rna was isolated from these samples. a total of 68 samples were confirmed influenza positive by m-gene-specific rt-qpcr. among the iav-positive clinical samples, 51 samples were h5 hpai-positive, and each clade was successfully analyzed using our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay (table 3 and figure 3 ). next, we confirmed the sequence of all h5 hpai-positive samples using the universal ha sequencing primers, forward 5 -gcattggytaycatgcaaaya-3 and reverse 5 -ttgctrtggtgrtayccataca-3 , and classified each clade using the influenza research database. interestingly, when we have compared with sequencing analysis and clade identification using each amplicon, the primers and probes for the pan-h5 hpai-specific and two clade-specific multiplex rt-qpcr assays were well-matched ( figure 3d ). these results show that our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay could be a promising technique for specific discrimination of multiple h5 hpai viruses in field samples from infected avian species. to detect h5 hpai in fecal samples using our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay, we obtained a total of 4350 fecal samples from domestic chickens

manual on animal influenza diagnosis and surveillance [21] . + influenza positive sample. ** all sequences were confirmed from genbank at the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) or the influenza research database (ird, www.fludb.org). each concentration had triple replicates.since h5n1 hpai viruses was first identified in 1996, diverse subtypes of h5 hpai were classified. global and domestic spread of these virus caused huge losses to the poultry industry [18] . novel h5nx hpai viruses appeared due to reassortment of the ha gene with different na genes. according to the who report [22] , h5nx [24] , vietnam [25] , and laos [26] between 2013 and 2016.despite many efforts to control the spread of h5 hpai viruses [27] in poultry, such as development of a vaccine and diagnostic systems [28] , viruses evolved and infected wild birds and domestic poultry. in particular, to effectively monitor and control h5nx hpai virus transmission, a number of diagnostic techniques, including virus isolation and conventional rt-qpcr, have been reported [29] . virus isolation is the gold standard for influenza virus diagnosis, but it is time-consuming, expensive, and not suitable for discrimination of multiple hpai viruses. the conventional rt-qpcr assay is well-known and useful for molecular detection of influenza viruses such as influenza virus subtyping and positive detection using matrix gene detection [30] . in particular, this method detects the fluorescence signal of a positive sample in real time due to using of the target-specific probe/primers, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity. therefore, the rt-qpcr assay could be widely used as molecular diagnostic technology in clinical fields. to detect h5 hpai virus and difference of h5 hpai clade viruses in clinical samples, a multiplex rt-qpcr assay has been developed using several pairs of primers and probes [29, 31, 32] . however, some drawbacks are the reduced specificity and sensitivity of the target gene amplification due to the nonspecific interaction among primers and probes in the same reaction [32] .in this study, novel primers and probes were designed for the pan-h5 hpai detection and the classification of two clades of h5 hpai, 2.3.4.4 or 2.3.3.1, in field samples. our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr assay was successfully employed to amplify viruses and iav-positive field samples using novel primers/probes for the simultaneous detection of pan-h5 hpai and two clades without cross-reactivity. to enhance the specificity of target detection, we designed a new single primer set and each probe for the conserved sequences of h5 hpai. after testing the iav-positive clinical field samples, 51 were h5 hpai positive and the cycle threshold values of these positive samples ranged from around 20 to 24. moreover, all h5 hpai-positive samples were sequenced, and the results were verified by genbank blast processing. interestingly, the limit of detection of pan-h5 hpai and clades in the singleplex and multiplex rt-qpcr assays was the same when our new single primer set and each probe combination was used.our one-step multiplex rt-qpcr method ensures highly specific and sensitive simultaneous detection of pan-h5 hpai and two clades of h5 hpai. our method development focused on pan-h5 hpai and two clades of h5 hpai virus, 2. respiratory viral infections are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries [nair et al., 2010; walker et al., 2013] . accurate and rapid identification of the etiological agent is important for patient management and control of respiratory disease outbreaks [garbino et al., 2004] .the clinical presentation of respiratory infections caused by various viral pathogens can be very similar; hence, etiological diagnosis is important [coiras et al., 2004] . also, there may be a possibility of co-infections occurring in pediatric and immunecompromised individuals.respiratory viral infections have traditionally been diagnosed in the laboratory by culture of respiratory specimens and direct fluorescent assay (dfa) [ginocchio, 2007] . nucleic acid amplification tests (naat) have been developed for classical as well as newly emerging respiratory viruses and have been shown to be more sensitive and time efficient than dfa or culture. however, testing for all respiratory viral targets using individual pcrs is expensive and laborious. a conventional multiplex rt-pcr would be a very useful tool in resource limited settings. therefore, multiplex pcr methods were developed with the aim of detecting different viruses simultaneously [coiras et al., 2004; bellau-pujol et al., 2005; kim et al., 2009; choudhary et al., 2013a] .the introduction of multiplex real time rt-pcr assays has increased the efficiency of routine molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses and has been shown to be cost effective [gunson et al., 2005; mahony et al., 2009; auburn et al., 2011; jansen et al., 2011] . the use of specific labeled probes ensures easy interpretation when used in a multiplex format. however, multiplexing of real-time rt-pcr may reduce the assay sensitivity and is limited due to availability of few commercially available fluorophores and instrumentation [fox, 2007] .a multiplex pcr followed by detection of products by suspension microarray is one of the most promising approaches for simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses [krunic et al., 2007; lee et al., 2007; mahony et al., 2007; merante et al., 2007; pabbaraju et al., 2008] . the xtag respiratory virus panel (rvp) fast assay (luminex molecular diagnostics inc., toronto, canada) is a ce marked commercially available kit based on suspension microarray technology and enables the detection of large number of viruses in a single reaction [krunic et al., 2007; merante et al., 2007] . rvp fast assay has a simple protocol and shorter turnaround time than the original rvp assay and detects 19 different viruses or subtypes: influenza a (subtype: h1, h3), influenza b, respiratory syncytial virus a (rsv-a), rsv-b, parainfluenza virus 1 (piv-1), piv-2, piv-3, piv-4, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses 229e, nl63, oc43, hku1, rhinovirus/enterovirus (rhv/ev), adenovirus, and human bocavirus. recent studies show that the rvp assay is more sensitive and specific compared with culture and antigen detection [wong et al., 2009; gadsby et al., 2010] . however a major disadvantage of rvp fast assay is the cost of the kit and the instrument. in this study, we compared the performance of an in-house developed conventional multiplex rt-pcr, monoplex real time rt-pcr and xtag rvp fast assay for the detection of multiple respiratory viruses and their subtypes in clinical specimens.respiratory specimens (nasal/throat swab, n ¼ 310) mainly from pediatric patients less than 5 years of age (253/310) referred to the national institute of virology, pune from august 2009 to march 2011 for diagnosis of influenza a/h1n1pdm09 were included in this study. all the samples were pre-screened for influenza a/h1n1pdm09 at the time of collection and were stored at à70˚c. this was a retrospective study and approved by institutional ethical committee. mean age of patients was 3.8 years. the study comprised 192 males (61.9%) and 118 females (38.1%).total nucleic acid (dna and rna) extraction was performed using qiaamp nucleic acid extraction kit (cat no 57704) (qiagen, germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. two hundred microlitres of clinical sample was spiked with 20 ml ms2 (internal control for rvp fast assay, provided by manufacturer) and eluted in 50 ml elution buffer. all the three tests were performed in parallel.conventional multiplex rt-pcr and monoplex real time rt-pcr were carried out as described by choudhary et al., [2013a] . mrt-pcr was carried out in three tubes/sets covering 18 viruses/ subtypes (set 1: influenza a, subtype seasonal h1, h3 and pandemic h1, influenza b; set 2: rsv a and b, hmpv, piv 1-3; set 3: piv-4, coronavirus oc43/hku1, coronavirus 229e/nl63, rhinovirus/enterovirus). adenovirus and bocavirus were not tested by mrt-pcr and real time rt-pcr.monoplex one step real time rt-pcrs (rrt-pcr) for influenza a, subtype seasonal h1, h3, pandemic h1 (2009), influenza b, and internal control rnasep were carried out according to the protocol provided by centers for disease control and prevention, usa (cdc). for rsv-a and b, piv-1, -2, -3, coronavirus oc43, 229e, nl63, and rhinovirus, the rtrt-pcr assay was performed as described by gunson et al., 2005;  for hmpv by maertzdorf et al., 2004 and for piv-4 as described on the following website www3.appliedbiosystems.com/cms/groups/mcb/cms 088565.pdf.the luminex xtag 1 rvp fast assay is a ce certified kit and detects influenza a (including subtypes h1 and h3), influenza b, rsv a and b, hmpv, piv 1-4, coronavirus oc43, 229e, nl63, hku1, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, and bocavirus. the xtag 1 rvp fast assay kit cannot differentiate between rhinovirus and enterovirus. the xtag 1 rvp fast assay kit detects influenza a only and do not have marker to subtype influenza a in h1n1pdm09. in addition, the rna bacteriophage ms2 was used as an internal extraction control and dna bacteriophage lambda was used as an amplification and assay performance control. if the ms2 or lambda controls failed in the rvp fast assay, the test was repeated to obtain a valid result. a one step single tube multiplex rt-pcr was performed according to the xtag rvp fast assay product insert instructions. pcr amplification was performed on a geneamp pcr system 9700 (applied biosystems, foster city) using the following cycling parameters: 1 preheating step (cdna synthesis) at 50˚c for 20 min, 1 denaturing cycle at 95˚c for 15 min, followed by 34 amplification cycles at 95˚c for 30 sec, 59˚c for 30 sec, and 72˚c for 30 sec, ending with 1 cycle at 72˚c for 2 min and a hold at 4˚c until ready for use. all reagents, the xtag rvp fast bead mix, reporter buffer, the xtag streptavidin and phycoerythrin (sa-pe) conjugate were vortexed before use. a 1:75 dilution of sa-pe was prepared in xtag reporter buffer. each hybridization reaction contained 20 ml of bead mix, 2 ml of amplified dna and 75 ml of sa-pe in a 96-well plate. the plate was incubated for 20 min at 45˚c followed by analysis on the luminex 200 instrument using xponent w software and results were analyzed on tdas w software.a true positive (gold standard) was defined as being positive by more than one test used or any specimen that was positive by only one of the tests with further confirmation by a sequencing method. true agreement was defined as at least one virus being the same in at least two methods and if third method detected more than one virus, only this additional virus was confirmed with sequencing. for sequencing, rsv glycoprotein gene [choudhary et al., 2013b] , metapneumovirus nucleoprotein gene [choudhary et al., 2014] , parainfluenza virus hemagglutinin gene, rhinovirus 5 0 -untranslated region and coronavirus oc43 surface glycoprotein gene were sequenced using in-house developed unpublished primers. viruses not included in the mrt-pcr and rtrt-pcr i.e., adenovirus and bocavirus, which were identified by rvp fast assay, were not considered as a discordant and also not confirmed with sequencing.statistical analysis was carried out using the pasw statistics 18 software package. the sensitivity and specificity were also computed for all the three tests.the archived retrospective clinical specimens were selected to compare the sensitivities of the assays. a total 310 samples were tested in this study and results are summarized in table i . according to the gold standard, a total 202 samples were found positive. three samples were found positive for adenovirus by xtag rvp fast assay only, therefore sensitivity calculation for mrt-pcr and rtrt-pcr, 199 samples were considered as true positives. of the 193 (62.2%) samples detected positive by mrt-pcr, 179 samples were positive for single virus and 14 (7.8%) for two viruses. of the 175 (56.4%) samples detected positive by rtrt-pcr, 167 samples were positive for a single virus and eight (4.5%) samples showed two viruses. xtag 1 rvp fast assay detected 138 (44.5%) samples as positive where 123 samples were positive for one virus, 13 for two virus and two samples for three viruses respectively as shown in table ii . the overall sensitivity of the mrt-pcr was 96.9% (95% ci: 93.5, 98.8), for rtrt-pcr was 87.9% (95% ci: 82.5, 92.1) and for xtag 1 rvp fast assay 68.3% (95% ci: 61.4, 74.6). overall specificities of all the three tests were 100%.targets and discordant analysis: influenza a and bthirty five known influenza a positive samples were tested in this study (35/310 or 11.2%). all the 35 were subtyped as h1n1pdm09 virus according to the rtrt-pcr protocol and mrt-pcr. the xtag 1 rvp fast kit detects influenza a only and do not have a marker to subtype influenza a in h1n1pdm09. the xtag 1 rvp fast kit detected 19 positive for influenza a only and 16 false negative for influenza a. sensitivity and specificity for influenza a virus was 100% (95% ci: 89.9, 100) for rtrt-pcr and mrt-pcr. sensitivity for rvp fast assay was 54.2% (95% ci: 36.6, 71.1). of the five samples positive for influenza b by the rtrt-pcr and mrt-pcr, rvp fast assay detected only one specimen as positive. 100% concordance was observed between the mrt-pcr and rtrt-pcrs for influenza a/h1n1pdm09 and influenza b. sensitivity of rvp fast assay for influenza b was 20% (95% ci: 3.3, 71.1).a total of 75 (24.1%), 75 (24.1%), and 57 (18.3%) samples were detected positive for rhinovirus/ for rsv-b, 37 (11.9%) samples were detected positive by both rtrt-pcr and mrt-pcr while rvp fast assay detected only 18 (5.8%). sensitivity of rtrt-pcr and mrt-pcr for rsv-b was 97.3% (95% ci: 86.1, 99.5) and for rvp fast assay was 47.3% (95% ci: 30.9, 64.1). one sample negative by both rtrt-pcr and mrt-pcr but positive by rvp fast assay was confirmed by sequencing to be positive for rsv-b. of the twenty samples negative by rvp fast assay for rsv-b, eight samples were randomly selected for sequencing and confirmed as rsv-b. for rsv-a, 15 (4.8%) samples were detected positive by both rtrt-pcr and mrt-pcr and only two by rvp fast assay. out of the 13 samples negative by rvp fast assay, nine randomly selected samples were confirmed as rsv-a positive by sequencing. 100% concordance was observed between rtrt-pcr and mrt-pcr for rsv a and b.two samples were detected positive for piv-1 by both rtrt-pcr and mrt-pcr but only one was positive by rvp fast assay. the sample negative by rvp fast assay was confirmed to be piv-1 positive by sequencing. a total 18 (5.8%) and 17 (5.4%) samples were detected positive for piv-3 by mrt-pcr and rtrt-pcr respectively and only

rtrt-pcr and one by rvp fast assay were confirmed to be hmpv positive by sequencing.hcov coronavirus oc43 was detected in six samples by both rtrt-pcr and rvp fast assay. only four samples were detected as oc43 positive by mrt-pcr. two specimens negative by mrt-pcr were confirmed to be coronavirus oc43 positive by sequencing. adenovirus and bocavirus were not included in sensitivity calculation since we did not test for the two viruses by mrt-pcr and rtrt-pcr. none of the samples were found to be positive for seasonal influenza a/h3n2, piv-2, coronavirus-nl63, 229e, and hku1.one kit of xtag rvp fast assay contains reagents for 96 tests. additionally, external controls need to be included in each run, and for a full plate, more than one control is recommended. reagents for the nucleic acid extraction step are purchased separately. the cost of testing the 18 viruses discussed in the present study for one sample by mrt-pcr, rtrt-pcr, and rvp fast assay was us$ 27, us$ 45, and us$ 92 respectively and this includes only reagents cost excluding labor cost.the overall duration of the xtag rvp fast assay was 5 to 6 hr for 16 samples including one positive and one negative control (90 min for rna extraction, 15 to 20 min for pcr setup, 150 min for rt-pcr, 15 to 20 min for hybridization setup, 45 min for hybridization, and 10 to 15 min for reading on luminex instrument). the overall duration of the real time rt-pcr assay was 8 to 9 hr for 16 samples including one positive and one negative control (90 min for rna extraction, 60 to 70 min for pcr setup, 6 hr to run the rt-pcr thrice on one instrument). the overall duration of the mrt-pcr assay was 6 to 7 hr for 16 samples including one positive and one negative control (90 min for rna extraction, 30 to 40 min for pcr setup, 3 hr to run the rt-pcr and 60 to 90 min for gel run.traditional methods of detection and identification of respiratory viruses like cell culture and immunofluorescence are labor intensive, slow and are dependent on specimen quality. nucleic acid amplification tests (naat) have shown increased sensitivity and quicker turnaround time compared to non-amplification tests [arens et al., 2010] . the high detection rates of naats are due to the inclusion of a larger number of viral targets with increased sensitivity allowing detection of low copy numbers of different viruses [mahony et al., 2007; pabbaraju et al., 2011] . finally, accurate diagnosis will optimize antiviral treatment and implementation of infection control and public health measures. the xtag 1 respiratory virus panel assay is based on suspension microarray technology which enables the detection of a large number of targets in a single reactions [krunic et al., 2007; merante et al., 2007] . the rvp fast assay provides a considerable reduction in time and less steps of post pcr manipulation from the first version of the assay .the xtag 1 rvp assay has been shown to offer results comparable to or superior to those of culture/ dfa and nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections [mahony et al., 2007; pabbaraju et al., 2008; jokela et al., 2012] . the xtag rvp assay has shown the best sensitivity to common viral targets when compared to the resplex ii and multicode-plx assays when compared with culture [balada-llasat et al., 2011] . the xtag rvp assay has been also used successfully for the detection of etiological agents in outbreaks of respiratory illness [wong et al., 2009] .in this study, the performance of the in-house developed conventional multiplex rt-pcr, with monoplex real time rt-pcr and luminex xtag 1 rvp fast assay was assessed by the retrospective testing of 310 respiratory clinical samples originally submitted for the diagnosis of influenza a/ h1n1pdm09 virus. the overall sensitivity was 96.9%, 87.9%, and 68.3% for mrt-pcr, rtrt-pcr, and xtag 1 rvp fast assay respectively. since bocavirus and adenovirus were not tested by multiplex rt-pcr and real time rt-pcr hence excluded for sensitivity calculation for these tests. in this study, we found that the xtag 1 rvp fast assay is less sensitive than mrt-pcr and rtrt-pcr. the overall rvp fast assay sensitivity was 78.8% reported by gadsby et. al. [2010] , 77.5% for all the targets reported by pabbaraju et. al. [2011] , 87.2% reported by kim et. al. [2013] while 33% reported by raymaekers et. al. [2011] . pabbaraju et. al. [2008] reported rvp assay sensitivity and specificity as 91.2% and 99.7% respectively when their in-house naats were considered as a gold standard. in another study, rvp fast assay showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 91% when compared with culture, while multicode-plx showed 89% and 87% and resplex ii showed 89% and 94%, respectively [balada-llasat et al., 2011] . popowitch et al. [2013] re-] reported sensitivity and specificity for xtag rvp fast as 84.4% and 99.9% respectively. in the present study, a lower sensitivity of rvp fast assay was observed compared to that reported in other studies. this may be due to the fact that in this study we have compared the rvp fast assay against well standardized and robust molecular assays using clinical samples whereas most of the other studies have compared the rvp fast assay against cultures/ dfa using isolates. another reason may be the sequence variation in the primer-probe binding regions between viruses circulating in india and other parts of the world.in a recent study by synlab in germany (http:// www.luminexcorp.com/prod/groups/public/documents/ lmnxcorp/p104-escv-2012-synlab-rvp.pdf) [30], comparisons were made between their homebrew light cycler assay, rvp fast v2, and rvp fast v2 'extended amplification'. the rvp fast v2 assay performed well with quality control for molecular diagnostic (qcmd) samples which had ct values lower than 30. however for samples with ct values higher than 30, a considerable drop in sensitivity was observed. to remedy this, pcr cycles were increased by 3 cycles (extended amplification) to increase sensitivity. the protocol for xtag rvp fast assay was not modified in the present study since it is a ce marked kit.considering the entire detection spectrum, the present study detected 62.2% samples positive by mrt-pcr, 56.4% by rtrt-pcr and 44.5% by xtag 1 rvp fast assay. similar findings have been reported in previous studies using the rvp fast assay [gadsby et al., 2010; babady et al., 2012] or the original rvp assay [mahony et al., 2007; pabbaraju et al., 2008; gharabaghi et al., 2011] . the 7.8% co-infections were detected by mrt-pcr, 4.5% by rtrt-pcr and 10.8% by rvp fast assay as shown in table ii . similar coinfections were reported by others for rvp assay [mahony et al., 2007; pabbaraju et al., 2008; gadsby et al., 2010; jokela et al., 2012] .the rvp fast assay mainly failed to detect influenza a, b, rsv a, b, and piv-3 viruses. concordance between mrt-pcr and rtrt-pcr for influenza a/h1n1pdm09, influenza b, rsv a and b was 100%. influenza a samples missed by rvp fast assay had mfi (median fluorescent intensity) values ranging between 150 and 300. the cut off value to consider positive for influenza a target was 300 mfi. it was observed that the discordant results of the rvp negative samples were associated with relatively high ct values (mean ct in rt-pcr 34). the limitation of xtag rvp fast assay was that it does not subtype influenza a into h1n1pdm09 and the kit was not upgraded since the emergence of h1n1pdm09. upgrading of the xtag rvp fast assay to accommodate the subtyping of influenza a into h1n1pdm09 virus might increase the diagnostic value of the kit. the lower sensitivity of influenza b was also reported by pabbaraju et al. [2011] and suggested sequence variation in the hemagglutinin gene of flu b in the primer binding region. gharabaghi et. al. [2011] reported influenza b sensitivity 64.9% for rvp fast assay. the sensitivity of rvp fast assay for rsv-a, rsv-b, and piv-3 was 13.3%, 47.3%, and 44.4% respectively. gharabaghi et. al. [2011] reported rsv-a sensitivity 85.5% and rsv-b 98.3%. similar reports were published by other groups [gadsby et al., 2010; rand et al., 2011; kim et al., 2013; popowitch et al., 2013] . low sensitivity of rsv in rvp assay attributed to the high ct value in real time rt-pcr and may be due to the genetic variation of the virus. pabbaraju et. al. [2008] also observed that their discordant rsvs were of low titer as well. the lower sensitivity in rvp fast assay for piv-3 was also reported [gharabaghi et al., 2011; babady et al., 2012] .hmpv, rhinovirus and piv-4 were detected with lower sensitivity by rtrt-pcr when compared with mrt-pcr. rvp fast assay and mrt-pcr have combined rhinovirus and enterovirus targets, these viruses clubbed together as rhv/ev to perform sensitivity of the tests. real time rt-pcr sensitivity for rhinovirus was 66.2%, mrt-pcr and rvp fast assay 87.2% respectively. the reduced sensitivity may be because both mrt-pcr and rvp fast assay detect rhinovirus and enterovirus while rtrt-pcr specifically detected only rhinovirus. sensitivity of rhv/ev in rvp fast assay was reported 93% by popowitch et al. [2013] , 89.6% by gadsby et al., [2010] . a total 48 rhinovirus/enterovirus positive samples were sequenced, out of which 42 (87.5%) were confirmed as rhinovirus and six (12.5%) as enterovirus by sequencing. similar findings were also reported by others [pabbaraju et al., 2008; gadsby et al., 2010] . a relatively lower number of specimens were positive for coronaviruses, parainfluenza and metapneumovirus in our sample set. two coronavirus oc43 positive samples missed by mrt-pcr had ct values of 33 and 35 in the rtrt-pcr. a significant limitation in the present study was the absence of influenza a (h3n2) to evaluate the kit performance for detection of it. therefore, a larger number of positive specimens are required in order to fully assess the sensitivity of the rvp fast assay for all targets.in addition to sensitivity and specificity, ease of use, required time and cost are important factors to consider when choosing a multiplex pcr. each assay evaluated in this study had advantages and disadvantages. the cost of testing the 18 viruses discussed in the present study for one sample by mrt-pcr, rtrt-pcr and rvp-fast assay was us$ 27, us$ 45, and us$ 92 respectively which include only reagents and consumables. the overall duration of the rvp fast assay was 5 to 6 hr, for real time rt-pcr was 8 to 9 hr and mrt-pcr was 6 to 7 hr. similar observation for workflow and cost were reported for rvp fast assay by rand et al. [2011] and babady et al. [2012] . luminex xtag rvp fast assay has the advantage of strict quality control and manufacturing practices which minimizes errors during testing of the samples. luminex xtag rvp assay is an open pcr system and post amplification products are manipulated (hybridization), increasing the risk of potential laboratory contamination [kim et. al., 2013] . mrt-pcr has disadvantage because it requires the visual inspection of products in gel and have a potential for amplicon contamination. real time rt-pcr offers decreased contamination risk. more technical skill is required to perform xtag rvp fast assay and rtrt-pcr than mrt-pcr. limitation of the present study was that we have not tested prospective samples.in summary, the in-house developed mrt-pcr and rtrt-pcr showed better sensitivity, specificity and is more cost effective compared to the rvp fast assay. results of this study indicate that implementation of the in-house developed mrt-pcr for testing of respiratory samples will improve our rate of diagnosis of respiratory tract infections and can be used in resource limited settings.acknowledge archana, kunal, minal and the technical team of the influenza group for their help.viruses have always posed significant threats to public health, as highlighted by the recent ebolavirus outbreak in west africa [1] [2] [3] [4] and the emerging and re-emerging nature of influenza viruses 5 . to face the world-wide threats caused by zoonotic rna viruses, which suddenly cause serious outbreaks by invasion from nonhuman hosts and mutate rapidly, we must understand the molecular evolutionary changes in their genome sequences extensively by innovating various technologies, including those used in big data analyses, e.g., large-scale word count. time-series word count of oligonucleotides in genome sequences can be conducted without specialized assumptions and prior knowledge and is useful for unsupervised data mining. importantly the obtained results are easily understandable, even for those unfamiliar with molecular evolutionary studies.oligonucleotide composition varies significantly among species even with the same genome g+ c%; therefore, the composition, especially of short oligonucleotides, has been used as a phylogenetic parameter "genome signature" 6 to classify microbial genomes, including viral genomes. viruses are inevitably dependent on many host factors for their growth (e.g., nucleotide pools, proteins and rnas) and must escape from host antiviral mechanisms (e.g., interferon-induced systems) [7] [8] [9] . therefore, after the invasion of zoonotic viruses from nonhumans, a certain level of directional change in genomic sequences and thus in mono-and oligonucleotide compositions should occur during human-to-human transmission. in fact, the g+ c% of influenza a virus strains isolated from humans is lower than that of strains isolated from natural hosts, which were avian 10 , and the cg dinucleotide in an a/u context has been preferentially eliminated from classical h1n1 influenza viruses during human-to-human transmission 11 . by using blsom (batch learning self-organizing map) 12,13 , we previously found directional compositional changes in a wide range of oligonucleotides 14, 15 that occurred after the onset of the influenza h1n1/09 pandemic of 2009 [16] [17] [18] .in this study, we first conducted time-series word counts on changes in mono-to pentanucleotide compositions, occurring after invasion from nonhumans, for ebolavirus, mers coronavirus and influenza viruses. then, scientific reports | 6:36197 | doi: 10.1038/srep36197 as an example of long oligonucleotides, we analyzed 20-mers. because 20-mers are composed of 4 20 (ca. 1.1 trillion) variables, the analysis becomes a big data analysis. long oligonucleotides are key elements of diagnostic pcr primers 19 and potentially promising nucleic-acid therapeutics (e.g., antisense rna, sirna and mirna) 19, [20] [21] [22] [23] . rna viruses mutate very rapidly, and therefore, their sequence changes should be intensively characterized for designing diagnostic and therapeutic oligonucleotides with long effectiveness. the present time-series analysis on influenza a genomes showed that the 20-mers exhibiting the most evident directional changes observed in common for three different subtypes corresponded to several influenza a sirnas, which were experimentally validated. time-series analyses can provide information on changes possibly reoccurring after invasions from natural reservoir hosts.spatiotemporal analysis of mononucleotide composition in ebolavirus genomes. because of the recent major threat to public health in west africa, more than 1000 genomes of zaire ebolavirus (ebov) strains, isolated from humans from 2014 to 2015, have been sequenced, and the sequences are available from the ncbi virus variation database 24 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/ebola/). to study molecular evolutionary changes in ebov genomes in the current epidemic, we obtained 1020 strains, for which the isolated dates are given. although we focused on full-length genomes, a minor portion was relatively short in length, or many unidentified "n" bases were included, partly because of the stringent sterilization treatment obligated by the local government 3 . because these will give odd values of mono-and oligonucleotide compositions, we focused on 935 genomes longer than 18.5 kb after omitting n bases, which were derived from 244 guinea, 156 liberia and 535 sierra leone strains. to conduct the present spatiotemporal analysis, 15 strains isolated from several other geographic areas were omitted.we first analyzed time-series change in mononucleotide composition for strains isolated in the three areas separately. figure 1a plots four mononucleotide compositions (%) in each genome according to the isolated day, which started on march 17, 2014 . because mutations occur primarily as random processes, mononucleotide compositions for strains isolated even around the same day clearly differed from each other, which resulted in evident compositional diversity. despite this diversity, which should also be due to sequencing uncertainty, linear regression lines appear to show a time-dependent increasing or decreasing trend, a possible increase for c% and g% and a possible decrease for a% and u%. this is consistent with the excess u-to-c mutations found by two groups 2,3 . 24 . data and regression lines separately analyzed for different geographic areas are differentially colored: guinea (blue), liberia (brown) and sierra leone (green). (b) averaged mononucleotide compositions for strains in each month are plotted according to the elapsed months from march 2014. data and regression lines for the elapsed months are colored as described in (a). a separate and additional regression analysis for data without the averaging (a) that can examine time-series changes from the epidemic start for all three areas showed that the null hypothesis (i.e. no correlation) was rejected for all mononucleotides in the three areas (12 cases) at the significance level of 0.01, except for t% and g% for guinea; this was rejected for the t% for guinea at the significance level of 0.05. for data after averaging (b), the null hypothesis was rejected at the significance level of 0.05 for mononucleotides in the three areas, except for g% and t% in guinea.scientific reports | 6:36197 | doi: 10.1038/srep36197the present study focused on time-series changes, but not on data variations caused largely by random mutations and sequencing uncertainty, and therefore, average characteristics of strains isolated in a similar period were analyzed, summing up the sequences isolated in one month and calculating an averaged mononucleotide composition for each month (fig. 1b) . this could be done because the genome sequence data were distributed rather evenly by area and month; the average number of strains per month was 22.2, 41.2 and 17.3 for guinea (blue), sierra leone (green) and liberia (brown), respectively. we omitted the data for a few months, for which no more than 5 strains were available in the respective area. figure 1b shows a more conspicuous increasing or decreasing trend than fig. 1a , and the time-series increasing or decreasing trend revealed by the regression line for the elapsed months was the same among the three areas for all nucleotides, except for an ambiguous case of g% for guinea. in more detail, positive and negative directions of the regression line were primarily common among the three areas, although the slope angle appear to differ; table 1 lists pearson's correlation coefficients calculated separately for the three areas. the highest negative (− 0.94) or positive (0.92) correlation among mononucleotides was observed for a% or c%, respectively, in liberia, which corresponded to a decrease of 10.2 as or an increase of 11.4 cs per genome at the final stage of the current outbreak. notably, the increasing or decreasing trend detected by these averaged data for one month (fig. 1b) is common to the result without averaging (fig. 1a) .in these regression analyses, the strains that were isolated in the three areas were independently analyzed. a separate regression analysis that could examine the statistical significance of directional changes from the epidemic start for all three areas, was conducted, by including the data of strains isolated at or near the beginning of the current epidemic (i.e., 2014 march strains in guinea) in liberia and sierra leone data. the results thus obtained by the latter analysis were consistent with those obtained by the former, and the null hypothesis (i.e. no correlation) was rejected at statistically significant levels in most cases, as described in figure legend short oligonucleotide composition in ebolavirus genomes. next, we analyzed each dinucleotide composition in the genomes grouped for each month. the results presented in fig. 2a , table 1 and supplementary  fig. 1a show that a common increasing or decreasing trend was observed among the three areas for more than half of the sixteen dinucleotides. correlation coefficients higher than 0.8 or less than − 0.8 are colored in table 1 . for nine of the ten colored dinucleotides, the coefficient in the other two areas primarily shows the common directional trend. these high correlation coefficients should reflect the evolutionary dependence of the genome sequences.a decrease in uu and au and an increase in cc (fig. 2a) are predictable, even as a cumulative effect of their constituent mononucleotides (fig. 1b) , but an increase in ac, cu, gu and ug is not predictable as a simple cumulative effect and may indicate the characteristics of the contiguous sequence itself. we thus calculated the ratio of the observed dinucleotide occurrence to that expected from the mononucleotide composition (obs/exp) and found a decrease for uu and gc and an increase for gu, ug, ac and ua, which was common among the three areas ( fig. 2b and supplementary fig. 1a) . the slope direction of the regression line was common among the three areas, but the slope angle appeared to differ among the areas for a wide range of dinucleotides, as well as for tri-and tetranucleotides (data not shown). a spatiotemporal word count can be conducted without specific assumptions or prior knowledge and visualizes viral evolutionary changes in an easily understandable way. two distinct models can explain the common increasing or decreasing trend among the three areas, which was observed for a wide range of mono-and oligonucleotides. [model 1] throughout the current ebov epidemic, virus movement between the three areas was extensive; therefore, the time-dependent trend of directional changes in oligonucleotide composition was common among the areas. [model 2] even without the extensive mixing of viruses, common directional changes can occur. for example, viruses inevitably depend on many host factors for their growth, but human cells may not provide an ideal growth environment for invading viruses; therefore, common directional changes occur after invasions from nonhumans for supporting more efficient growth in human cells. in this connection, park et al. 3 reported there was no clear evidence for import or export of ebov across national borders after its initial introduction. furthermore, although an increasing or decreasing trend for a wide range of mono-and oligonucleotides is common among the three areas, their actual composition (%) and the slope angle of the directional change often differ among the areas. this observation is consistent with model 2 and the report by park et al. 3 but not with model 1, as discussed below from various aspects.when considering the cellular environment differences between natural hosts (bats) and humans, not only the low-molecular substances (e.g., nucleotide pool) but also the macromolecules (e.g., proteins) involved in viral growth must be considered. additionally, antiviral mechanisms 7-10 should differ between humans and natural hosts. host macromolecules involved in viral growth (either supporting or inhibiting) should primarily recognize oligonucleotides, such as several nucleotides or longer, rather than mononucleotides. hence, we analyzed time-series changes in pentanucleotide (5-mer) occurrences. we first calculated correlation coefficients for all 1024 (= 4 5 ) 5-mers and sorted them by the averaged correlation coefficients for the three areas. figure 3a and supplementary fig. 1b show time-series patterns of 5-mers with evidently high or low correlation coefficients; 384 or 50 (of 1024 types) 5-mers showed a common decreasing or increasing trend among the areas, respectively. examination of the ratio of the observed occurrences to those expected from the mononucleotide composition (obs/exp) showed that directional changes of many 5-mers cannot be explained by a cumulative effect of mononucleotide changes (data not shown), as found for various dinucleotides. when further examining the 5-mers showing the common directional change in more detail, their actual occurrence level and slope of supplementary fig. 1b) , and the difference often became clearer compared to that for mono-and dinucleotides. this cannot be explained by the aforementioned model 1. if the time-series directional change in mono-and oligonucleotide composition found for ebov is actually due to the necessity of supporting efficient growth in human cells (model 2), such directional changes should be observed for other zoonotic rna viruses.directional change in mers virus genomes. we next analyzed mers coronaviruses isolated in the recent epidemic starting in april 2012 in the middle east 25, 26 . the ebov outbreak analyzed above was initiated by a single virus strain being introduced from a nonhuman animal; this virus was then transmitted among humans during the outbreak. in contrast, mers viruses were repeatedly transmitted from nonhumans, mainly camels, in this epidemic 25 , although its original natural host is thought to be bats 26 . because direct nonhuman hosts for different human isolates differ among isolates, information on camel-derived strains in the current epidemic is important. from the ncbi virus variation database 24 , we found 91 and 16 strains from humans and camels, respectively, with known isolated dates. the total number of mers virus genomes is approximately one tenth of ebov genomes, but their sequence length, even after omitting n bases, is mostly similar to its genome size (ca. 30 kb); only one sequence that was evidently short (29.3 kb) was omitted from this analysis. we grouped sequences in each month and analyzed the averaged mono-and oligonucleotides (from 2 to 5-mers) for each month and host.clear time-dependent increasing or decreasing trends were observed for a wide range of mono-and dinucleotides (fig. 4a,b) , but the increasing or decreasing trend found for actual mono-and oligonucleotides clearly differed from ebov; e.g., c% and g% decrease and u% increases in mers viruses. ebov is a negative-sense single-stranded rna virus, and the sequences registered in the database and analyzed here were complementary to viral genome sequences, but mers virus is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus and, therefore, genome sequences were analyzed. this difference, however, cannot explain differences in directional changes in monoand oligonucleotide composition of ebov and mers viruses. figure 3b presents four 5-mers with a high increasing or decreasing trend; e.g., during this 38-month epidemic, approximately six uuuuus or four ccacus have been gained or lost per genome, respectively. the time-dependent gain of u 5 (fig. 3b) clearly differs from its loss for ebov (fig. 3a) . although the regression lines (blue lines in figs 3b and 4) were calculated only for human strains, occurrence data for camel strains (brown) were primarily positioned around the regression line, thus fitting the previous report that mers viruses were repeatedly transmitted between camels and humans in the present epidemic 25 . because time-series directional changes in mono-and oligonucleotide compositions were observed for both ebov and mers viruses, the directional change should occur for other zoonotic rna viruses. mononucleotide composition in influenza virus genomes. we next analyzed influenza viruses, for which a large number of sequences are available from the influenza research database 27 for different human a subtypes, epidemics of which have started independently at long intervals, such as several decades. importantly, the aforementioned model 2, in which the common directional change between different viral populations is expected without extensive virus mixing, is testable more rigorously than for the ebov outbreak, which started from a single invasion in guinea and expanded to other countries. furthermore, we may examine the following important issue. if a common directional change is observed, what types of changes likely reoccur in future epidemics caused by invasions from natural reservoir hosts?in addition to human a subtypes, genome sequences of human b type, which can currently infect humans but not birds, and of various avian a subtypes were available. the genomes of influenza a and b are composed of eight segments, and we first selected ca. 25,000 strains with a full set of eight sequences, categorized the full genome sequences according to host and serological type, and grouped them in each year. the sequence length cut-off was not included because the genome is composed of eight segments of various lengths and a simple, satisfactory criterion for length cut-off could not be set. alternatively, because 20 times more sequences are available than for ebov, we selected years with at least ten strains of one category to reduce the artefactual effects derived from sequencing uncertainty. then, to analyze time-series changes, we selected human or avian a subtypes with more than five years fulfilling the above threshold (≥ten strains per year); the human b type also fitted these criteria. in the case of h1n1/09 [16] [17] [18] (starting from 2009 and abbreviated ph1n1 in the database), a sufficient number of sequences fulfilling the above threshold was available even per month and, therefore, ph1n1 sequences in each month were analyzed; importantly, this allowed the study of changes occurring within one outbreak in detail. collectively, we focused on thirteen subtypes (three human and nine avian a subtypes and a human b type), and first analyzed time-series changes in mononucleotide compositions.three human subtypes of influenza a virus (human h1n1, h3n2 and ph1n1) changed their a%, c% and g% with common increasing or decreasing trends among the three subtypes (fig. 5a) , despite different epidemics having started by independent invasions from nonhumans; the g+ c% increase in human a subtypes was previously reported by rabadan et al. 10 . figure 5a shows that the a%, c% and g% move time-dependently apart from those of avian a subtypes (sky blue) and toward those of the human b type (violet). because the b type can currently infect humans, but not birds, this type has possibly adapted better to growth in human cells than a subtypes. the directional change of human a subtypes "apart from avian a subtypes and toward the human b type" may visualize their evolutionary journey from each start of human-to-human transmission. in the case of u%, human h1n1 (blue) and h3n2 (brown) have already reached the b's level, and only ph1n1 (green) shows an increasing trend toward b.averaged mono-and dinucleotide compositions (a,b), for strains in each month are plotted according to the elapsed months from april 2012. camel-derived strains are specified by small brown symbols, and regression lines (blue) were calculated only for human-derived strains. the null hypothesis was rejected for all data (8 cases) at the significance level of 0.01, except for a% and g%, with or without camel-derived strains; this was rejected for the g% at the significance level of 0.1.scientific reports | 6:36197 | doi: 10.1038/srep36197 a large number of ph1n1 strains isolated from 2009 to 2014 could provide detailed information on changes occurring within and after one outbreak because the averaged mononucleotide compositions for each month were analyzed. in fact, a horizontally long panel examining three human a subtypes (fig. 5b) revealed that a% monotonically increased from 2009 to 2012 but it abruptly lost half of the increase in 2013 (arrowed), followed by a possible partial recursion increase in 2014; c% and g% ( supplementary fig. 2a ) also showed a monotonic decrease from 2009 to 2012, followed by an abrupt backset.we next analyzed the di-to tetranucleotide compositions. concerning correlation coefficients for the elapsed years in the case of h1n1 and h3n2 and for the elapsed months in the case of ph1n1, three subtypes show a common increasing or decreasing trend for thirteen of sixteen dinucleotides. the top four cases for the absolute value of averaged correlation coefficients for the three subtypes were examined in fig. 6a . as observed for mononucleotides, all three subtypes appeared to move from avian a subtypes toward the human b type. a decrease in cg dinucleotides in a/u motifs during human-to-human transmission was previously reported 11 .detailed inspection of ph1n1 (fig. 6b) showed a monotonic increase of aa% from 2009 to 2012 was followed by an abrupt backset in 2013 (arrowed). here, we discuss the backset occurring after one outbreak may relate to the differential slopes of directional changes observed for different subtypes (figs 5 and 6 ). ph1n1 strains, which are primarily derived from one outbreak, show an evidently steeper slope than h1n1 and h3n2 strains derived from multiple outbreaks, indicating a higher rate of ph1n1genome sequence changes. the first discussion was whether ph1n1 had an evidently higher mutation rate than h1n1 and h3n2. we propose here that without introducing the higher mutation rate of ph1n1, its seemingly higher rate of genome sequence changes can be explained by the model that conforms to the abrupt backset that occurred after an outbreak. when considering a viral infection spread, the ratio of persons with or without proper resistance to the viral infection (e.g., antibodies the same colored and smaller symbols than for human subtypes are used for avian a subtypes because differences among avian subtypes were not a concern in the present study. because the b type has moved gradually toward human a subtypes, this type appears not to have reached its hypothesized goal, which may possibly lie between human a and b types, but nearer the latter. (b) a horizontally long panel for a% of three human a subtypes is presented for clarifying detailed changes occurring within and after one outbreak of ph1n1. data of c% and g% are presented in supplementary fig. 2a .scientific reports | 6:36197 | doi: 10.1038/srep36197 that are highly effective against the respective strain) becomes important. therefore, the blooming strains (and their close relatives) in a certain outbreak (especially in a pandemic) may not be a very suitable strain for restarting the next outbreak because antibodies highly effective against the blooming strains are held by a large portion of humans. less blooming strains, that are less adapted to humans, may become good starting strains for the next outbreak, resulting in a backset after one outbreak, as observed in figs 5b and 6b and supplementary fig.  2 . hence, the evolutionary change focusing on strains belonging to a single outbreak looks higher than those belonging to multiple outbreaks, giving a steeper slope. to illustrate this interpretation, we added hypothetical data of h3n2 strains belonging to one outbreak as a series of small light-brown dots representing the dinucleotide compositions hypothesized for individual months, whose slope angle simply mimics that of ph1n1. although other various mechanisms must be included to explain the backset after one outbreak, we propose that the steep slope of ph1n1 can be explained without introducing the higher mutation rate of ph1n1.a wide range of tri-and tetranucleotides also showed decreasing or increasing trends common among the three subtypes (data not shown). the common increase or decrease of mono-and oligonucleotides should reflect the convergent-type evolution occurring in independently evolving viruses, which have invaded independently from nonhumans. we predict that the time-dependent changes required for efficient growth in human cells will repeat with a significant probability after future invasions from natural reservoir hosts and that this view is most likely applicable to a wide range of zoonotic rna viruses.long oligonucleotides in human influenza a genomes. next, a time-series analysis was performed on long oligonucleotide occurrences. long oligonucleotides are key elements of diagnostic rt-pcr primers 20, 28 and nucleic-acid therapeutics (e.g., sirnas) 19, [21] [22] [23] . when designing diagnostic and therapeutic oligonucleotides with long effectiveness for highly mutable viruses, we have to understand fundamental features of time-series directional changes of long oligonucleotides and to predict changes that will reoccur with a high probability. the sizes of pcr primers and therapeutic oligonucleotides range primarily from 15 to 30 nucleotides 19, [21] [22] [23] . thus, we analyzed 20-mer occurrences in genomes of three human influenza a subtypes, which independently invaded from nonhumans. of a total of 4 20 (ca. 1.1 trillion) types, ca. 1.4 million types of 20-mers were found in these genomes. importantly, a time-series word count can analyze such big data without difficulty.after calculating correlation coefficients for each 20-mer for each subtype, we first selected all 20-mers having an evidently high or low correlation coefficient (> 0.8 or < − 0.8) in common for the three subtypes; all five 20-mers thus selected had negative correlation coefficients and were found to be mutually overlapped; i.e., these were components of one 24-mer. figure 7a presents time-series occurrences for one 20-mer, acagcagagugcuguggaug; other four 20-mers gave practically the same decreasing pattern. at the beginning stage of three independent epidemics, most strains had one copy of the 20-mer, but during the course of human-to-human transmission the copy number decreased in the viral population and were almost completely lost at the final stage in all three subtypes; i.e., the strains having this 20-mer sequence progressively reduced their share in viral populations, regardless of differences in subtypes. we think that this common decrease reflects a certain inconvenience for efficient growth in human cells and will reoccur with a high probability after a future invasion. we next discuss this common decrease, in connection with sirna designs.because of the social importance of influenza viruses, varieties of sirnas have been designed as promising nucleic-acid therapeutics. actually, virsirnadb 29 , which have complied the experimentally validated sirna sequences, contains 96 sirnas for influenza a viruses; and their length ranges from 19 to 21. when we searched viral sirna sequences that were highly homologous to the 20-mers with an evident common increasing or decreasing trend with a blast search against virsirnadb, we found that four 19-mer influenza a sirnas (virsi1635, 1640, 1645 and 1650), which had the same sequence (cagcagagugcuguggaug) but were experimentally validated in different cell lines, showed a complete match to the 19-mer sequence harbored by the aforementioned five 20-mers, which are components of one 24-mer (aggaacagcagagugcuguggaug). although these five 20-mers gave practically the same decreasing pattern to that listed in fig. 7a , the compensatorily increased 20-mer responding to their decrease differed slightly in changed positions among the subtypes. figure 7b ,c present patterns of the compensatorily increased 20-mers, which had nonsynonymous and synonymous changes from the original 20-mer, respectively (for details, see the legend). this indicates that the sequence ranging over a certain length is possibly inconvenient for efficient growth in human cells ranges and that changes within the range can resolve the possible inconvenience. since both synonymous and nonsynonymous changes were observed, the possible inconvenience should not relate to protein sequence. the information about the time-dependent directional change and the changed base should become important for designing sirnas with long effectiveness.future prospects. finding time-series directional changes in long oligonucleotide occurrences for a large number of influenza a genomes can provide a new refinement strategy for designing therapeutic oligonucleotides and diagnostic rt-pcr primers with long effectiveness. three influenza a subtypes may not be sufficient to judge the reoccurrence of the change, and therefore, our group has started to analyze the time-series changes in experimentally validated sirna sequences, by focusing on both human and avian strains. an important issue is clarification of biological mechanisms responsible for directional changes in oligonucleotide occurrences after host changes. if the mechanism is clarified, reoccurrence in the future should become much clearly defined. systematic analyses on a wide range of oligonucleotides with various lengths for the genomes of human and avian strains may give useful information about the possible mechanisms.judging from the directional changes observed in ebov and ph1n1 outbreaks, genome sequences from strains isolated within several months after a new invasion appear to give reliable information about the directional change. if a large number of viral sequences becomes available, an averaging even per week for strains that are isolated in properly assigned geographic areas may clarify time-dependent directional changes. undoubtedly, past sequences from the same or closely related viral genomes become important for comparison. in the present study, we focused on zoonotic rna viruses whose reservoir hosts are vertebrates, but it is undoubtedly important to analyze other rna viruses spread by bugs (e.g., ticks and mosquitos), which have caused serious emerging infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and zika virus disease 30, 31 .results obtained with time-series word count are easily understandable even for those unfamiliar with evolutionary biology. when social importance of time-series word count of oligonucleotides becomes clear, experts in various fields will participate actively. huge numbers of genome sequences, including those from disease-causing microbial strains, have accumulated rapidly because of revolutionary development in sequencing technologies and of social importance. in this era of big data accumulation, participation of experts in big data analysis becomes increasingly important for interdisciplinary efforts against big threats presented by infectious microorganisms.genome sequences of human zaire ebolavirus (ebov) and mers coronavirus strains were downloaded from the ncbi virus variation database 24 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/) on dec. 20 and dec. 31 (2015) , respectively. because the number of mers virus sequences is small, compared with the other two viruses analyzed, a time-series analysis was conducted for the months having at least three strains, and when the number of strains for a certain month was less than 3, these were combined with those of the nearest neighboring month that had the lower number of strains than the other neighbor. from the ncbi influenza virus resource 27 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/flu/), a total of ca. 200,000 segment sequences derived from ca. 25,000 influenza a and b virus strains were obtained on sep. 1 (2015) . we calculated mono-and oligonucleotide occurrences in eight genome segments of influenza virus strains and summed up the occurrences for each strain. to prevent possible misassignment from a large number of ph1n1 strains, relatively small numbers of human classical h1n1 strains isolated from 2009 were omitted from the present analysis. influenza virus is a negative-sense single-stranded rna virus, and therefore, the sequences analyzed are complementary to viral genome sequences. computer codes are available from k.w. (k_wada@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp).coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive stranded rna-viruses [1] . the viral rna genome is 27-32 kb in size, capped, polyadenylated and encapsidated in a helical nucleocapsid. the envelope is studded with long, petal-shaped spikes, giving the virus particle a characteristic crown-like appearance. three distinct groups of coronaviruses have been described based on serological affinity and genome sequence. coronaviruses can infect humans and a variety of domestic animals and can cause highly prevalent diseases such as respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular and neurologic disorders [2, 3] .until recently only three human coronaviruses were thoroughly studied. human coronavirus oc43 (hcov-oc43; group 2) and human coronavirus 229e (hcov-229e; group 1) were identified in the 1960s. they are responsible for 10-30% of all common colds, and infections occur mainly during winter and early spring [4] [5] [6] [7] . a third novel human coronavirus, sars-cov, was identified as the causal agent during the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) [8] [9] [10] . phylogenetic analysis showed that the sars-cov does not closely resemble any of the three previously known groups of coronaviruses, and therefore a tentative fourth group of coronaviruses was suggested [11, 12] . however, an early split-off of the sars-cov from the coronavirus group 2 lineage has also been suggested [13, 14] .a new human coronavirus associated with respiratory illness, hcov-nl63, was recently identified by a research team in the netherlands [15] . the virus was isolated in january 2003 from a nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 7month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis, conjunctivitis and fever. screening of specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms identified seven additional hcov-nl63 infected individuals, both children and adults, between december 2002 and february 2003. the complete viral genome sequence was determined. the characteristic genome organisation of coronaviruses can be observed: the 5' two-third of the genome contains two large open reading frames (orf), orf1a and orf1b. in the 3' part of the genome, genes encoding four structural proteins are found: spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n). the hemagglutinin-esterase (he) gene, characteristic for group 2 coronaviruses, is not present in hcov-nl63. sequence analysis demonstrated that hcov-nl63 shares 65% sequence identity with hcov-229e. phylogenetic analysis confirmed that hcov-nl63 is a new group 1 coronavirus, most closely related to hcov-229e and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) [15] . shortly after van der hoek and colleagues published their discovery of the new human coronavirus hcov-nl63, a second research group described the characterization of essentially the same virus [16] . the virus was isolated from a nose swab sample collected from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the netherlands in april 1988. real-time rt-pcr assays were designed for screening of respiratory tract samples. four additional hcov-nl63 positive samples, from children aged 3 months to 10 years, were detected between november 2000 and january 2001.hcov-nl63 can be considered as a new important cause of respiratory illnesses and two different subtypes might be currently cocirculating in the human population [15] . in this study we wanted to explore the incidence of hcov-nl63 infection in children diagnosed with respiratory tract infections in belgium.we studied 309 isolates from 279 patients with severe respiratory symptoms collected from january 2003 until march 2004 at the university hospital in leuven, belgium. these isolates originated from bronchoalveolar lavages, pharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and sputum samples. routine diagnostic testing was performed for respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. no prior amplification by cell culture was performed. the results of diagnostic tests for rsv were negative for 244 isolates, while 65 isolates were positive for rsv. patients ranged in age from 1 month to 16 years, with a mean age of 2 years. the temporal distribution of the isolates corresponded to the yearly rsv epidemic period: 236 samples were collected from january to june 2003 and 73 samples were recovered during the first trimester of 2004 ( figure 1a ).rna was extracted from the collected specimens by using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit (qiagen, westburg, the netherlands) according to instructions of the manufacturer. screening of the samples was performed by amplifying a 251 bp fragment of the polymerase gene using the following primer set: cor-fw (5'-acwcarhtvaayyt-naartaygc-3') andcor-rv (5'-tcrcayttdg-grtartccca-3') ( figure 2 ). these one-step rt-pcr assays (onestep rt-pcr kit; qiagen) were undertaken in a 50 µl reaction volume containing 10 µl rna-extract, 10 µl 5x qiagen onestep rt-pcr buffer, 2 µl dntp mix (final concentration of 400 µm of each dntp), 1.8 µl qia-gen onestep rt-pcr enzyme mix (a combination of omniscript and sensiscript reverse transcriptase and hot-startaq dna polymerase), 4 µm of each primer, and rnase-free water to 50 µl. the reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50°c for 30 min, followed by pcr activation at 95°c for 15 min, 50 cycles of amplification (30 sec at 94°c; 30 sec at 48°c; 1 min at 72°c), and a final extension step at 72°c for 10 min in a geneamp pcr system 9600 thermal cycler (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa). pcr-products were run on a polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under uv-light.samples that were found positive for hcov-nl63 were confirmed using one-step rt-pcr assays, which amplified four different regions of the hcov-nl63 genome. amplification of a 314-bp gene fragment in the nucleocapsid region was performed with two specific hcov-nl63 primers: n5-pcr1 (5'-ctgttactttggctttaaagaact-tagg-3', nt 26695-nt 26721) and n3-pcr1 (5'-ctcac-tatcaaagaataacgcagcctg-3', nt 26982-nt 27008). secondly a 237-bp fragment in orf1b was amplified using the primers repsz-1 and repsz-3 described by van der hoek and colleagues [15] . a third rt-pcr assay was carried out on the hcov-nl63 positive samples amplifying a 839-bp fragment with orf1a specific primers: ss5852-5p and p4g1m-5-3p [15] . these one-step rt-pcr detection of hcov-nl63 and hcov-oc43 in samples from patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms assays were performed essentially as described above. they were carried out using 5 µl rna-extract and 0.6 µm of each primer. only 45 cycles of amplification were run and annealing temperature was set at 50°c. furthermore a 663 bp fragment of the spike gene was amplified using a rt-nested pcr. the outer primer set sinl5 (5'-gagttt-gattaagagtggtaggttg-3', nt 20391-nt 20415) and sinl3 (5'-aacagtgtagttaactacacgg-3', nt 21068nt 21089) were used in a one-step rt-pcr, performed as described above, using 10 µl of rna-extract and an annealing temperature of 48°c. a nested pcr was carried out with the inner primer set sinl5n (5'-ggttgttgt-tacgcaataatggtcgt-3', nt 20411-nt 20436) and sinl3n (5'-acacggccattatgtgtggtgac-3', nt 21051-nt 21073). the nested reaction mix was composed of 1 unit taq polymerase, 1 µl of a 25 mm dntp-mix, 10 µl 5x buffer c (pcr optimizer kit, invitrogen, the neth-erlands), and 30 pmol of forward and reverse primer in a 50 µl reaction volume. as template 10 µl of the outer pcr product was added. the cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 94°c for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (45 sec at 94°c, 45 sec at 54°c, 1 min at 72°c), and a final extension of 5 min at 72°c. pcr-products were run on a polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under uvlight. the amplicons were purified using the qiaquick pcr purification kit (qiagen) and sequenced with the respective primer pairs using the abi prism bigdye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit (version 3.1) on an abi prism 3100 dna sequencer (applied biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. positive and negative controls were included in each pcr experiment. the hcov-nl63 positive control was rna isolated from a hcov-nl63 culture. chromatogram sequencing files were inspected with chromas 2.2 (technelysium pty ltd, helensvale, australia), and contigs were prepared using seqman ii (dnastar, madison, wi, usa). the obtained consensus sequences were compared with the prototype hcov-nl63 sequences available in genbank database release 142.0 using blast analysis (ncbi blast server). multiple sequence alignments were prepared using clustal x version 1.82 [26] , and manually edited in the genedoc alignment editor [27] . phylogenetic analysis was conducted using mega version 2.1 [28] .the sequences determined in this study have been deposited in the genbank sequence database under accession numbers ay758276 to ay758301.our collection of samples was also screened using the pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay for the presence of hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e. positive results were confirmed by one-step rt-pcr using hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e specific primer pairs located in the membrane glycoprotein region (oc43-fw: 5'-ggcttatgtggccccttact-3', nt 28580-nt 28599; oc43-rv: 5'-ggcaaatct-gcccaagaata-3', nt 28894-nt 28913; 229e-fw: 5'-tggccccattaaaaatgtgt-3', nt 24902-nt 24921; 229e-rv: 5'-cctgaacacctgaagcaat-3', nt 25456-nt 25475) [18] . one-step rt-pcr and sequence analysis were performed essentially as described above. annealing conditions during the rt-pcr assay were modified: the annealing temperature was set at 55°c.a pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay is a usefull tool to test for all coronaviruses in a clinical sample. besides quick screening for several pathogens in one assay, it supplies the possibility to identify previously unknown coronaviruses. the consensus rt-pcr assay as described by stephensen et al., designed to amplify all known coronaviruses, is not able to detect hcov-nl63 because of several mismatches with the primer sequences [15, 17] . we modified these consensus primers based on an alignment of the hcov-nl63 prototype sequence and 13 other coronavirus sequences (figure 2 ). to determine whether the newly designed pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay efficiently amplifies a broad range of coronaviruses the rt-pcr assay was tested on cell culture supernatant of the four known human coronaviruses and three animal coronaviruses: hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, hcov-229e, sars-cov, feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (phev), and murine hepatitis virus (mhv). amplification of the expected 251 bp region was observed for all tested coronaviruses ( figure 3 ). the sensitivity of the pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay was assessed by testing tenfold dilutions of hcov-nl63 and hcov-oc43 rna. while 50 copies of hcov-oc43 rna copies per µl nasopharyngeal aspirate could be detected, the sensitivity for hcov-nl63 was a bit lower i.e. 5 × 10 3 rna copies per µl nasopharyngeal aspirate.the pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay was used for screening of specimens from hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms collected between january 2003 and march 2004. samples, from which a 251 bp fragment could be amplified, were further identified by sequencing using the pancoronavirus primers. we studied 309 specimens with a temporal distribution that corresponded with the yearly rsv epidemic period ( figure 1a) . a total of 244 samples were found negative for rsv by diagnostic testing. the 279 patients in this study comprised of 211 patients aged <2 years (75.6%), 68 aged 2-16 years (24.4%). we detected hcov-nl63 in 7 samples (2.3%). one positive sample was collected at the end of january 2003 and coinfection with rsv type b was present. five of the positive samples were collected within a ten-day period at the end of february 2003, and one positive sample was collected at the end of february 2004, which showed coinfection with adenovirus and parainfluenza virus ( figure 1b , table  1 ). the seven positive samples were obtained from one patient aged 1 month, four patients of 1 year, one patient of 2 years, and one patient of 16 years. the patient files showed that all subjects suffered from respiratory tract illness and some had underlying disease ( table 1) .the seven hcov-nl63 positive respiratory samples were confirmed by alternative rt-pcr assays. amplification of a fragment of the nucleocapside gene and orf1b was carried out. sequence analysis of the n gene fragments and the orf1b fragments showed 98-100% similarity to the prototype hcov-nl63 sequences available in the gen-bank database (ay567487, ay518894). a third one-step rt-pcr was carried out for each positive sample to amplify part of the orf1a gene. sequence analysis of the orf1a pcr-products revealed 99% sequence identity with both hcov-nl63 prototype sequences available in genbank. a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on an alignment of the orf1a nucleotide sequences from the hcov-nl63 positive samples and the available hcov-nl63 sequences in genbank. hcov-229e was used as an outgroup. the dendrogram shows that all hcov-nl63 sequences cluster together, but two subclusters can be observed (figure 4 ). figure 3 gel electrophoresis after pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay. the indicated band of 251 bp corresponds with the expected amplicon size. as a marker molecular weight marker vi was used (boehringer mannheim, germany). inspection of the two full genome hcov-nl63 sequences available in genbank demonstrates that especially the aminoterminal region of the spike protein can be very divergent. therefore we decided to amplify this region to investigate the variability of these region in our patients. an rt-nested pcr assay was used to amplify part of the s gene. these partial spike sequences showed 98% similarity with the hcov-nl63 prototype strains. an alignment of the s gene sequences from the belgian samples, partial spike sequences from the positive samples identified in the netherlands (data not shown), and the prototype hcov-nl63 sequences, was used to constitute a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. the neighbor-joining tree was evaluated by 500 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. two clusters can again be observed ( figure 5 ).screening of our sample collection for the presence of hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e was also performed. we partial membrane sequences of the contemporary belgian strains showed 97-99% similarity with the hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e prototype sequences in genbank.rsv, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and parainfluenzaviruses are probably the most important viral agents of severe respiratory diseases. however, a substantial part of respiratory tract infections can not be attributed to any known pathogen. underlying conditions and immunosuppression largely determine the impact of respiratory viruses on individuals [19] . the common cold viruses hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e have also been associated with more severe lower respiratory tract conditions in infants and immunocompromised patients [20] [21] [22] [23] . the clinical symptoms associated with hcov-nl63 infections still need to be determined, but there are some indications that hcov-nl63 can cause severe respiratory illnesses in children and immunocompromised adults [15, 16] . we detected hcov-nl63, using a pancoronavirus rt-pcr, in patients suffering from relatively severe respiratory dis-eases necessitating hospitalization. these positive samples were collected from children aged 1 month to 16 years. two patients suffered from severe underlying disease: one patient suffered from smith-lemli-opitz syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to a primary enzymatic defect in the cholesterol metabolism. a second patient was diagnosed with vater, a syndrome characterized by the sporadic association of specific birth defects or abnormalities such as vertebrae and vascular anomalies, anal atresia, trachea and esophagus problems and renal anomalities. all hcov-nl63 infected patients established a complete recovery from their respiratory symptoms. one-step rt-pcr assays were used to detect and confirm these positive samples.results from epidemiological surveys conducted in the 1970's have led to the conclusion that human coronaviruses are distributed worldwide and circulate during seasonal outbreaks [22] . our results indicate that hcov-nl63 is the causal agent in a significant portion of respiratory diseases of unknown etiology. we detected hcov-nl63 in respiratory samples collected in february 2003, with a frequency of 7.1%, and during february 2004, with a frequency of 2.5%. these results seem to support the tendency of human coronaviruses to circulate mainly during the winter season [7, 24] . however, in this study, sampling was only performed from january to may during the yearly rsv epidemic period, while no samples from the summer and autumn months were screened. the first publication on hcov-nl63 showed that the virus circulated in amsterdam during the winter months of 2002/ 2003 [15] . more recently another set of amsterdam samples was screened, obtained during the winter of 2001/ 2002 and 2003/2004. hcov-nl63 was found in one trachea sample obtained in february 2002, and in two oropharyngeal aspirates from december 2003 and january 2004, respectively (data not shown). combined with the data that we present here from belgium, these findings confirm that hcov-nl63 reappears each winter season similar to the previously known respiratory viruses. recently, research teams from australia, japan and canada, have submitted partial hcov-nl63 sequences to the genbank database (ay600442-ay600446, ay662694-ay662698, ay675541-ay675553). this indicates that this newly discovered human coronavirus has a worldwide distribution.sequence analysis of the highly conserved nucleocapsid region showed that the belgian isolates are similar to the two prototype hcov-nl63 complete genome sequences in genbank isolated in the netherlands in 1988 and 2003. furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of part of the orf 1a region of our patients showed the same subclusters of hcov-nl63 that were described previously [15] ( figure 4 ). this finding supports the suggestion that phylogenetic analysis of the partial s gene nucleotide sequences based on an alignment of the belgian spike sequences, spike sequences from the positive samples identi-fied in the netherlands, and the prototype hcov-nl63 sequences available in genbank figure 5 phylogenetic analysis of the partial s gene nucleotide sequences based on an alignment of the belgian spike sequences, spike sequences from the positive samples identified in the netherlands, and the prototype hcov-nl63 sequences available in genbank. accession numbers: hcov-nl63, ay567487; hcov-nl, ay518894. pedv was used as an outgroup. several hcov-nl63 subtypes with distinct molecular markers are cocirculating, also in belgium. a large insert in the 5' part of the s gene of hcov-nl63 compared with hcov-229e has been described [15, 16] . both hcov-nl63 complete genome sequences show only 89% sequence identity in this spike insert region, which implies that there are at least two different hcov-nl63 subtypes. sequence analysis of this spike insert region revealed that our samples show similarity to both prototype hcov-nl63 subtypes, which was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. the partial s gene sequences cluster together with the two prototype hcov-nl63 sequences in two different groups ( figure 5 ). this confirms that the hcov-nl63 subtypes first isolated in 1988 and 2003 are cocirculating. when analysing the dendrograms based on orf1a and s gene sequences, a discordance in the clustering pattern of some hcov-nl63 isolates (e.g. hcov-nl and nl-p223) can be observed, suggesting a possible recombination event. further research of complete genome sequences of these isolates is required. drawing conclusions based on phylogenetic analysis of one single gene therefore requires caution as the true phylogeny can only be demonstrated by analysing complete genome sequences.screening of our sample collection for the presence of hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e revealed seven hcov-oc43 positive samples and only one hcov-229e positive sample. all positive samples were isolated during winter and early spring, which is concordant with the results of previous epidemiological studies. hcov-oc43 infected samples were mainly identified during february 2003 and february 2004 ( figure 1b) . these data show that the epidemic seasons of hcov-oc43 and hcov-nl63 coincide. the positive samples were collected from children aged 1 to 12 years, whom all suffered from respiratory symptoms. the very low detection rate of hcov-229e compared with the frequent detection of hcov-nl63, might imply that hcov-nl63, closely related to hcov-229e, is currently more important as a causal agent of respiratory diseases. at the moment, there are no data concerning cross-neutralization between hcov-229e and hcov-nl63. in theory, such cross-neutralization might be possible, since both viruses are relatively closely related species belonging to coronavirus group 1. antigenic crossreactivity has already been demonstrated between sars-cov and group 1 coronaviruses tgev, fipv and ccov [25] .the development of a pancoronavirus rt-pcr assay using a primer set that matches all known coronaviruses might be useful for the identification of new coronaviruses. this pancoronavirus rt-pcr-assay can also be used as a diagnostic tool to detect any of the four currently known human coronaviruses in clinical samples.human coronavirus nl63 is a new important respiratory pathogen that can cause severe respiratory infections in children. sequence analysis of the hcov-nl63 isolates detected in our study demonstrates that our belgian isolates can be classified into two subtypes corresponding to the two prototype hcov-nl63 sequences isolated in the netherlands in 1988 and 2003. our findings indicate that these two subtypes may currently be cocirculating.viral respiratory tract infections are a common cause of hospitalization and mortality in infants and young children. influenza a, influenza b, parainfluenza, human rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and coronavirus are recognized as viral agents associated with respiratory tract infections [1] [2] [3] . therefore, there is a need for a rapid and sensitive differential diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens to prevent nosocomial infections and to minimize unnecessary antibiotic usage [4] [5] [6] .existing standard nonmolecular diagnostic methods such as viral culture and immunofluorescence (dfa) are timeconsuming, labor intensive, or have low sensitivity [7, 8] . accordingly, molecular techniques are increasingly accepted for diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections. in the last few years, multiplex rt-pcr assays have been developed to detect respiratory viruses [9] , and some have been commercialized, such as xtag rvp from luminex [10, 11] , multicode plx rvp from eragen biosciences [12] , and resplex ii from qiagen [13] .in our previous study, a multiplex pcr based on the genomelab gene expression profiler (gexp) analyzer had been shown to be effective for the detection of pandemic influenza a h1n1 virus [14] , nine serotypes of enteroviruses associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease [15] , and sixteen different respiratory virus types/subtypes in a single tube [16] . however, these methods are not likely to be widely adopted in provincial centers for disease control and prevention due to the limited availability of gexp equipment. therefore, in this study, a two-tube multiplex reverse transcription pcr assay (twotube assay) to detect sixteen respiratory viruses based on the amplicon size differences using automated electrophoresis system is described. one tube is used for the simultaneous detection of nine respiratory viruses, including influenza a virus (flua), influenza b virus (flub), seasonal influenza a virus subtypes h1n1 (sh1n1), parainfluenza virus type 1 (piv1), human rhinovirus (hrv), coronavirus subtypes oc43 (cov oc43), coronavirus subtypes 229e (cov 229e), coronavirus subtypes hku1 (cov hku1), and adenovirus (adv). another tube is used for the simultaneous detection of seven respiratory viruses including parainfluenza virus type 2 (piv2), parainfluenza virus type 3 (piv3), respiratory syncytial virus a (rsva), respiratory syncytial virus b (rsvb), coronavirus subtypes nl63 (cov nl63), human metapneumovirus (hmpv), and human bocavirus (hbov). as the two-tube assay uses the qiaxcel automated electrophoresis system, which is accessible in most of provincial centers for disease control and prevention in china, this two-tube assay may have greater potential for the routine surveillance of respiratory virus infection in china and to improve the capacity for emergency management.a total of 247 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected in the children's hospital of beijing, china, during june 2008 and march 2010 from hospitalized children under two years of age presenting acute lower respiratory infection (alri) syndromes based on clinical measurements recommended by the world health organization (who). the patients were included in this study according to the following criteria: parenchymal infiltration on chest radiography, dry or moist rale, body temperature above 37.5 ∘ c, a normal or low leukocyte count, or lower chest wall indrawing. the mean age of study participants was 13.08 months. of 247 cases, 149 (60.32%) participants were male and 98 (39.68%) female. a total of 160 (64.78%) participants were from urban areas and 87 (35.22%) were from suburban or rural areas of china (hebei, henan, shanxi, shandong, and inner mongolia). the specimens were collected within 5 to 7 days after symptoms onset. patients with bacterial infections were excluded. all aspects of the study were performed in accordance with national ethics regulations and approved by the institutional review boards of the center for disease control and prevention of china. children's parents were apprised of the study's purpose and of their right to keep information confidential. written consent was obtained from children's parents.total rna/dna was extracted from 200 l of clinical sample using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). the extracts were eluted into 50 l of dnase-and rnase-free water and stored at −80 ∘ c.nine pairs of chimeric primers [17] were added to tube 1 to detect nine respiratory viruses, and eight pairs of chimeric primers were added to tube 2 to detect seven respiratory viruses. one pair of internal control primer and one pair of universal primers were added to both tubes. the sequence from human genome rnase p gene was used as an internal control primer for the specimens [16] . the primers sequences, the target genes, the amplicon sizes, and primer working concentrations are listed in table 1 .step rt-pcr kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) was used for the amplification. a total of 25 l pcr mixture containing 2 l of extracted rna and varied primer concentrations (table 1 ) was subjected to the following conditions: 50 ∘ c for 30 min, 95 ∘ c for 15 min, followed by 10 cycles of 95 ∘ c for 30 s, 55 ∘ c for 30 s, and 72 ∘ c 30 s; 10 cycles of 95 ∘ c for 30 s, 65 ∘ c for 30 s, 72 ∘ c for 30 s; 25 cycles of 95 ∘ c for 30 s, 48 ∘ c for 30 s, and 72 ∘ c for 30 s, and a final incubation of 72 ∘ c for 3 min [15] , and the reactions were analyzed on the qiaxcel automatic electrophoresis using qiaxcel dna high-resolution kit.the specificity of the two-tube assay on all viral targets was tested individually in the two multiplex reactions under the experimental condition as described previously. cell-cultured virus stocks contained in nattrol respiratory validation panels 2 (natrvp-2) (zeptometrix, buffalo, new york, usa) were used as the positive controls of flua, flub, sh1n1, piv1-3, hrv, adv, rsva, rsvb, hmpv, cov 229e, and cov oc43 to validate the specificity. specimens genotyped previously [18, 19] were used as positive controls of hbov, hku1, and cov nl63.to determine the analytical sensitivity of the assay, serial dilutions of viral rna transcripts of all rna viruses and serial dilutions of the plasmids containing the adv and hbov target sequence were analyzed by the two-tube assay. the pcr products were cloned into a pgem-t vector, which was used to transform dh10b cells. the plasmid dna was extracted with an e.z.n.a. plasmid mini kit i (omega, ga, usa). the rna copy number was calculated after measuring the concentration of the rna transcribed in vitro using a t7 large-scale rna production system (promega, wisconsin, usa). for the dna viruses adv and hbov, the in vitro transcription was omitted. the sensitivity of the two-tube assay was examined by using premixed quantitative viral rna transcripts or plasmids. the personnel responsible for reading these and other assays were experienced staff with basic training in microbiology and molecular biology.luminex xtag rvp fast kit (abbott, illinois, usa) enables users to detect simultaneously flua, flub, rsv, piv1-4, adv, hmpv, cov 229e, nl63, oc43, hku1, enterovirus (hev)/hrv, and hbov. the rna/dna extracted from 247 clinical specimens was tested using the luminex xtag rvp fast assay in a 96-well plate format according to the manufacturer's instructions [3, 20] . the plate was analyzed using the bio-plex 200 system (bio-rad, ca, usa), and the median fluorescence intensity (mfi) was determined.the additional targets detected only by the two-tube assay were confirmed by independent pcr and sequencing. the expected size of each virus type/subtype-specific amplicon was observed and separated clearly from the other viral targets on qiaxcel automatic electrophoresis for all of the positive controls. no mispriming (primer dimer) or other amplification in the negative controls was observed in either tube ( figure 1 ). the qiaxcel dna high resolution kit is capable of resolving amplicons with as little as 5 bp size difference; the smallest size difference in this test was 10 bp.for the viral targets that used clinical specimens as positive controls (hbov, cov hku1, and cov nl63), a single pcr product was detected in addition to the internal control peak (126 bp). the sensitivity of the assay was evaluated for each virus type/subtype individually using serial tenfold dilutions ranging from 10 to 10 5 copies of cloned pcr products in both of the two tubes. the limit of detection for hrv, piv2, piv3, rsva, hbov, and adv was 20 copies per reaction and 200 copies per reaction for the other 10 virus type/subtypes assayed in this study.the sensitivity of two-tube assay when all the viral targets were present was also tested. the detection sensitivity in tube 1 with 9 pre-mixed viral targets was 2000 copies per reaction and 200 copies per reaction in tube 2 with 7 premixed templates ( figure 2 ).specimens. all the comparative detections were double-blind tests performed by trained staff in our laboratory. all of the 247 specimens assayed with the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were retested by the two-tube assay. the two assays detected presence of at least one of the 16 assayed viruses in 194 specimens, and the two assays both detected virus in 181 specimens. the two-tube assay detected virus in 8 specimens that were negative in the luminex xtag rvp fast assay (2 adv, 3 rsvb, 2 hrv, and 1 piv3), and 5 specimens had a positive detection of hrv only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay. the luminex xtag rvp fast assay identified 111 specimens to be coinfections, 83 of them (74.77%) were in complete agreement between both assays, and detection of 13 viruses (in 12 specimens) was missed by the two-tube assay. additional 14 viruses (in 14 coinfected specimens) were detected only by the two-tube assay, and 2 coinfection specimens (no. 28 and no. 118) gave inconsistent results between the two assays ( table 3) . as shown in table 2 , there were 40 viral infections identified only by the two-tube assay and 21 viral infections found only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay. the infection events not detected by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay included piv3 ( = 2), hrv ( = 15), hmpv ( = 1), adv ( = 11), rsva ( = 1), and rsvb ( = 10). thirty-two of these undetected targets were found in coinfections, and the remaining 8 targets (2 adv, 3 rsvb, 2 hrv, and 1 piv3) were single-target positive specimens by the two-tube assay. the two-tube assay failed to detect the following viral infections ( = 21): sh1n1 ( = 2), hrv ( = 13), adv ( = 1), and hbov ( = 5). sixteen of the 21 specimens were coinfections, and the remaining 5 targets were positive only for hrv specimens. because the hrv primers used in the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were able to amplify both hrv and enterovirus, the specimens positive for hrv detected only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay could be enteroviruses. the sensitivity, specificity, negative prediction value (npv), positive prediction value (ppv), the accordance rate, and the kappa value of each virus for the twotube assay, when compared to the luminex xtag rvp fast assay as a reference, are shown in table 2 .all of the 40 additional targets detected only by the two-tube assay were confirmed by sequencing as true positives. for those specimens with discordant results by the two-tube and rvp assays, the seeplex rv15 ace detection kit was used to resolve the discrepancy ( table 3) .the confirmed results were defined as the results detected by at least two of the three pcr assays [22, 23] , or the results of sequencing. the sensitivity, specificity, negative prediction value (npv), positive prediction value (ppv), the accordance rate, and the kappa value of each virus for the two-tube assay, when compared to the confirmed results as a reference, are shown in table 4 .in this study, a novel two-tube assay based on the qiaxcel capillary electrophoresis to replace gexp has been evaluated for the potential application in routine laboratory testing of respiratory viruses in china. under optimized working condition, the two-tube assay revealed good specificity without nonspecific amplification using size detection system though conventional validation of specificity is usually done by probe detection, hybridization, nested pcr, and sequencing. the two-tube assay achieved a sensitivity of 20-200 copies per reaction when assayed individually for each virus type/subtype, and 2000 copies when 9 viral targets were present in tube 1 and 200 copies when 7 viral templates were present in tube 2. these results suggest the utility of the two-tube assay for the detection of multiple respiratory virus infections for laboratories not equipped to perform liquid chip-based multiplex assays. the 247 specimens from hospitalized children showed a high prevalence of infection and co-infection with the common respiratory viral pathogens. hrv was found most frequently, followed by rsvb. the major discrepancies between the two-tube assay introduced in this study and the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were found for the detection of hrv, adv, hbov, rsvb, and sh1n1 (kappa = 0.770, 0.773, 0.907, 0.913, and 0.929, resp.) ( table 2 ). all of the hrv positive samples including 15 detected only by twotube assay were confirmed by sequencing to be positive for hrv a. the 13 hrv-positive specimens detected only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay could be enteroviruses because of the luminex rvp fast assay detecting enterovirus (the hev component of the hev/hrv). after resolved by the seeplex rv15 ace detection kit, three of them were truly discordant. for adv, seven specimens identified as positive only by the two-tube assay were shown via sequencing to be adv c, and 4 were adv b1. only one adv-positive specimen was missed by two-tube assay. for hbov, five specimens detected as positive only by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were also negative by the seeplex assay. the other 14 positive samples detected only by two-tube assay (10 rsvb, 2 piv3, 1 rsva, and 1 hmpv) were confirmed by sequencing as true positives. for sh1n1, all of the flua positives were sequenced, and 16 of 20 were sh1n1, the two-tube assay failed to detect 2 of the 16 sh1n1 positives. the detection results of coronaviruses (cov hku1, cov nl63, cov 229e, and cov oc43), influenza (flua, flub), piv1, and piv2 were completely consistent between the two assays. in summary, no false positives were found by the two-tube assay, and a total of 6 false negatives occurred: hrv ( = 3), sh1n1 ( = 2), and adv ( = 1). the two-tube assay was more sensitive than the luminex xtag rvp fast assay for the detection of hrv a, rsvb, adv b1, and adv c. the overall detection rate of the two-tube assay for each virus was comparable to that of the luminex xtag rvp fast assay (kappa > 0.75) demonstrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the twotube assay in the analysis of clinical samples.the two-tube assay, as confirmed by the luminex xtag rvp fast assay, revealed that almost 80% of the respiratory specimens tested were positive for at least one viral infection, and viral coinfections were frequent. the overall co-infection rates of the two-tube assay and the luminex xtag rvp fast assay were 48.58% (120/247) and 44.94% (111/247), respectively. compared with other similar reports [9, [24] [25] [26] , the extremely higher co-infection rate found by both assays might be due to the difference in the tested population and possible nosocomial infections in the hospital.the routine use of extensive testing by methods such as the two-tube assay should make large studies of the clinical relevance of single and multiple respiratory virus infections more feasible. the clinical relevance of the outcome of multiplex pcr tests for respiratory viruses is not yet fully determined. in one study of children with rsv infection, higher fever, longer hospital stays, and more frequent use of antibiotics were associated with multiple infections [27] . for some agents, such as influenza a and b virus, a positive test may provide the basis for antiviral treatment [28] . it has been suggested that a rapid etiologic diagnosis of viral rti could reduce unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, but this remains to be shown [28] .two distinct advantages of the two-tube assay are the short assay time and the low cost. the assay requires 5-6 hours to complete 100 samples, including a half hour to prepare pcr mixture, the whole rt-pcr (3 hours), and the detection on the qiaxcel automatic electrophoresis (12 tests/15 minutes), while using other liquid chip-based assays might take an entire workday [29] . the cost for two-tube assay is $10/test, including the rt-pcr kit and the consumables of detection versus at least $120/test [29] using other liquid chip-based assays [29] .in conclusion, the two-tube assay developed in this study using automatic capillary electrophoresis is a rapid, cost-effective method with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of respiratory virus infection, and it is demonstrated to have great potential for routine surveillance of respiratory virus infection.acute respiratory tract infections (rtis), which are considered the "forgotten pandemic", remain the leading cause of all cause mortality in children worldwide (bryce et al., 2005) . in spite of public health prevention measures and advanced in therapeutics, incidence rates of rtis in the united states have varied little over the past 70 years (monto et al., 1974) , and etiologic diagnosis remains challenging. the lack of broad based rapid and accurate diagnostic tools leads to over-prescribing of antibiotics, delayed definitive diagnosis with potential for increased complications, and ineffective epidemic control.molecular diagnostic assays have the greatest potential for impacting clinical practice for infectious agents, such as viruses, where conventional microbiologic methods (i.e. culture) do not provide timely results (ratcliff et al., 2007) . while nucleic acid amplification tests (naats) have been developed for multiple individual viruses (liolios et al., 2001) , the utility in clinical settings has been further extended by the availability of single platform systems, which can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens (liao et al., 2009; pabbaraju et al., 2008; raymond et al., 2009; wu et al., 2009) .electrospray ionization mass spectrometry following broad-range reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr/esi-ms), one of the single system platforms, has the potential to rapidly detect and semi-quantify different pathogens simulatenously. to date, studies with rt-pcr/emi-ms have been restricted to evaluation with individual respiratory bacteria and viruses (i.e. streptococcus , coronavirus (sars) , adenovirus (russell et al., 2006) , and influenza viruses (sampath et al., 2007) ), or detailed characterization (e.g. resistance gene recognition , genotyping of the organism ). the capacity of rt-pcr/emi-ms for broad range detection and rapid turnaround may provide a useful tool for clinicians in health care settings to aid in early diagnosis of rtis.we aimed to 1) demonstrate capacity of the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform to identify and subtype multiple respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates (npas); 2) and examine the performance characteristics of the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform in a pilot hospital-based retrospective proof of concept study.seven clinically relevant viral pathogens (coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), influenza a and b, parainfluenza type 2 and 3, adenovirus, and coronavirus (sars)) were obtained from zeptometrix with given concentrations (buffalo, ny). pooled negative npas tested by rt-pcr/esi-ms were used for the mock-up experiments. to determine the limit of detection (lod), serial of 2-fold dilutions from 1000 to 1 genome copies/well (1.3x 10 5 to 133 genome copies/ml) were spiked into the negative nasopharyngeal aspirates (npa). each concentration was repeated five times indepentently to ensure the precision. the lod was determined by the least concentration for which five out of five repeats were detected by rt-pcr/esi-ms.clinical samples were derived from patients who presented with suspected respiratory tract infection in a tertiary inner city teaching hospital according to a standardized collection procedure from may 2006 to november 2007. "excess" clinical samples were stored at -80°c until nucleic acid extraction. the microbiology database was queried for standard clinical virological results including rapid immunochromatographic tests for influenza and rsv (binex now, inverness, bedford, uk), direct fluorescent antibody staining tests (d3 ultra dfa respiratory virus id kit, diagnostic hybrids, athens, oh), rapid shell vial culture identification (r-mix too, diagnostic hybrids, athens, oh), roller tube culture, and hemadsorption tests ( figure 1 ). routine pcr testing was not performed in the clinical virology laboratory. two negative npas by clinical virology were obtained to match each positive sample in the same month of collection. the study was approved by the johns hopkins university institutional review board.samples were processed for total nucleic acid extraction using the thermo king-fisher (waltham, ma) robot according to an ambion (abi, foster city, ca) magmax viral kit extraction protocol. all samples were processed by a dedicated investigator (k.c.), who was masked to the clinical virology laboratory results at the time of processing.one-step rt-pcr was performed in a 5ul reaction mix consisting of 4 u of amplitaq gold (applied biosystems, foster city, ca); 20 mm tris, ph 8.3; 75 mm kcl; 1.5 mm mgcl2; 0.4 mbetaine; 800 mmmix of datp, dgtp, dctp, and dttp (bioline usa inc., randolph, ma); 10 mm dithiothreitol; 100 ng sonicated polya dna (sigma corp., st louis, mo); 40 ng random hexamers for the rt (invitrogen corp. carlsbad ca); 1.2 u superasin (ambion corp, austin, tx); 400 ng t4 gene 32 protein (roche diagnostics corp., indianapolis, in); 2 u superscript iii (invitrogen corp, carlsbad ca.); 20 mm sorbitol (sigma corp.); and 250 nm of each specific pcr primer. rt-pcr cycling conditions were: 60°c for 5 min, 4°c for 10 min, 55°c for 45 min, 95°c for 10 min, followed by 8 cycles of 95°c for 30 seconds, 48°c for 30 seconds, and 72°c for 30 seconds, with the 48°c annealing temperature increasing 0.9°c each cycle. the rt-pcr was continued for 37 additional cycles of 95°c for 15 seconds, 56°c for 20 seconds, and 72°c for 20 seconds. the rt-pcr cycle ended with a final extension of 2 min at 72°c followed by a 4°c hold. rt-pcr was used for both rna and dna virus amplification.the assay was performed using the ibis t5000 respiratory virus surveillance ii kit (ibis biosciences, inc., carlsbad, ca), designed to detect and subtype viruses from seven groups: conventional viruses (rsv, influenza a and b, parainfluenza types 1-4, adenoviridae type a-f) and viruses not conventionally identified in our clinical virology laboratory (coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus). in this research-use-only kit, there were 16 primer pairs distributed in a 96-well plate, in which each well contained one pair of primers. most viruses had two primer sets but there were 4 sets of primers for influenza viruses. each plate was able to test six patient samples with each specimen being tested in 16 wellsthe ibis t5000 platform performed automated post-pcr desalting, esi-ms signal acquisition, spectral analysis, and data reporting to analyze rt-pcr product as described previously . briefly, the steps were as follows: 15 ul aliquots of each pcr reaction were desalted and purified using a weak anion exchange protocol as described elsewhere (ward et al., 2004) . accurate mass (61 ppm), high-resolution (m/dm.100,000 full-width half-maximum) mass spectra were acquired for each sample using highthroughput esi-ms protocols described previously (sampath et al., 2007) . for each sample, approximately 1.5 ul of analyte solution was consumed during the 74-second spectral acquisition. raw mass spectra were post-calibrated with an internal mass standard and deconvolved to monoisotopic molecular masses. unambiguous base compositions were derived from the exact mass measurements of the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides. semi-quantitative results of pathogens were obtained by comparing the peak heights with the internal pcr calibration internal mass standard present in every pcr well at 100 molecules, which was also treated as the internal positive control in each well. a negative control was implemented in each batch of processing with sterile viral transport media as well.our clinical virology laboratory does not perform pcr tests routinely for all respiratory viruses. accordingly, those samples for which clinical virology laboratory and rt-pcr/ esi-ms did not agree and which had enough remaining volume (200ul) were sent to viracor (lee's summit, mo) for identification by another pcr-based platform (luminex respiratory assay, austin, tx), which is able to detect all the viruses rt-pcr/esi-ms could detect except for human bocavirus (pabbaraju et al., 2008) .sample throughput for rt-pcr/esi-ms, which included using one king/fisher extraction robot, one janus automated dispensing robot, four eppendorf thermocyclers, and one t5000 cleanup and injection automation system was evaluated.for the primary analysis evaluating performance of rt-pcr/esi-ms, standard clinical virology laboratory results were used as the reference test. figure 2 describes the number of subjects, each of which had one npa sample evaluated. the number of 'evaluable results' was operationally defined for purposes of primary and secondary performance evaluation as the number of individual evaluable results which could be compared to one another, since each npa sample could yield test results (by culture or rt-pcr/ms-esi) of 'negative', single positive, or multiple viral detections (figure 2 ). in the secondary analysis, we combined clinical virology laboratory results and the secondary (i.e. luminex) pcr-based results as the reference test. samples containing viruses for which the hospital's clinical virology laboratory had no protocol available (i.e. bocavirus and coronavirus detection) were excluded from the primary analysis but included in the secondary analysis if the viral agent could be detected by the other (luminex) rt-pcr-based method (i.e. all viruses except bocavirus). confidence intervals for sensitivity, and specificity were based on exact binomial probabilities. two-sample wilcoxon mann-whitney test was used for comparing the viral load in the clinical virology positive group with the negative group.all the mocked npa samples in seven viruses groups were detected successfully by the rt-pcr/esi-ms to the level of 150 copies/well (figure 3) . the rt-pcr/esi-ms was most sensitive in detecting adenovirus and least sensitive in detecting rsv (lod: 7 and 150 genome copies/well, respectively). (figure 2 ). after exclusion, overall agreement was 87.9 % (95% confidence interval (c.i.): 83.3-91.7%); sensitivity, and specificity, excluding those non-conventional viruses for which jhu has no identification protocols (14 coronavirus and 3 metapneumovirus) were 77.9% (95% c.i.: 68.2-85.8%) and 92.1% (95% c.i.: 86.9-95.7%), respectively (table 1) . among 257 samples for which results were available for the first accuracy analysis, 34 samples were found to disagree between rt-pcr/esi-ms and clinical virology laboratory. for individual pathogens identified in clinical virology, rt-pcr/esi-ms detected 98.9% rsv, 77.8% adenovirus, 70.3% parainfluenza and 59.1% influenza viruses (table 2) . rt-pcr/esi-ms also successfully subtyped eight influenza a, five influenza b, two parainfluenza type 1, 14 parainfluenza type 3 that were identified by clinical virology, as well as seven adenovirus types b and c that clinical virology had no protocol to subtype, but miss-subtyped one parainfluenza type 2 and one parainfluenza type 3, that were identified by the virology laboratory as parainfluenza type 3 and parainfluenza type 4, respectively. the median storage time was 10 months (range 7-19).viral load was semi-quantifiable by rt-pcr/esi-ms and ranged from 2,400 to > 320,000 copies/ ml. viral loads of rt-pcr/esi-ms positive samples in the clinical virology negative group were significantly lower than in the clinical virology positive group (median: 66,960 vs. > 320,000 copies/ml, respectively, p=0.04). figure 2 ). among the 51 original samples with results in disagreement between rt-pcr/esi-ms and conventional virology assays or for which jhu had no protocols, 25 (43%) had sufficient volume to be sent to for another pcr-based method, 12 had confirmed rt-pcr/esi-ms results, including 7 positive conventional viruses (3 influenza a, 2 rsv, 2 parainfluenza). two coronavirus and 1 metapneumovirus detection not detectable by conventional clinical virology protocols were confirmed as well. the overall agreement, sensitivity and specificity, after secondary analysis of available samples were 90.7% (95%c.i.86.5-94.0%), 83.2% (95%c.i 74.4-90.0%) and 95.6% (95%c.i 91.1-98.2%), respectively (table 3) .time to first result from sample preparation to detection of rt-pcr/esi-ms was 8 hours: 1 hours of rna extraction, 4 hours of rt-pcr, and 3 hours of processing in esi-ms. the estimated throughput of rt-pcr/esi-ms was 300 samples with 2 technicians and 24 working hours, which represented 1,080 pcr reactions.this study was a hospital-based retrospective pilot proof-of-concept study designed to demostrate the capacity and to determine the performance of the novel rt-pcr/esi-ms platform on mock-up samples and previously frozen clinical samples compared to clinical virology assays. our study showed that this novel assay was rapid and able to detect and subtype multiple respiratory pathogens in the hospital with 87.9 % accuracy, compared to conventional clinical virology assays. our study also indicated that pathogens not detectable by traditional clinical virology methods could be successfully detected by the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform.the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform has several advantages including rapid turnaround time and a more detailed pathogen characterization (i.e. relative semi-quantification, typing, and subtyping of species) versus conventional culture methods. the current common diagnostic methods in our clinical virology laboratory are culture-based, which may take days to yield results and are labor-intensive and expensive (anzueto et al., 2003) . although some rapid antigen tests offer faster detection times, their individual lower sensitivity and specificity limits their clinical utility as a sole methodology (ginocchio, 2007) . the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform has the capability to detect multiple pathogens efficiently and with high sensitivity, as well as the ability to determine the quantity of pathogens, which would be potential biomarkers of infection course or severity. however, further prospective validation study will be needed to determine clinical performance of this assay.while determining the performance of novel assays, similar problems have appeared for the discordant analysis of results between the new assays and reference standard tests. some researchers confirmed result of the novel assays discordant to the conventional culture or rapid antigen test by another multiplex rt-pcr assays (liolios et al., 2001; pabbaraju et al., 2008) . it remains controversial regarding how to examine a potentially more accurate novel assay versus the current "alloyed" standard. doring et al. proposed that clinical evidence of infections should be included in the validation of the novel nucleic acid test (doring et al., 2008) , however, our study design did not permit detailed clinical data collection.we recognize several limitations of our design. first, the operation of rt-pcr/esi-ms was performed almost a year after the initial tests done in clinical virology. utilizing "excess" npa obtained from clinical virology resulted in some specimens not being processed until more than a year after collecting them from patients. although the effect of length of storage of npa has been shown to be minimal within 2 months (ward et al., 2004) , the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown. ward et al. demonstrated that multiple freezing thawing cycles did not significantly alter the concentrations measured prior to freezing the influenza samples (ward et al., 2004) , while frisbie et al. indicated influenza rna could degrade in the -70°c freezer and may result in some loss of sensitivity (frisbie et al., 2004) . the second limitation is that we could not send every specimen for secondary analyses due to insufficient volume of some samples. this is an inherent limitation of the retrospective design used here. however, since almost half of the discordant results verified by another pcr-based method (12 out of 25), it might have little impact on the estimate. future study is merited to perform parallel comparison on every sample by another reference tests (e.g. another pcr based method) in order to better characterize the performance of the platform. thirdly, we could not test the performance of rt-pcr/esi-ms on every subtype of clinical revelant respiratory viruses because of the design of the study. for those viral subtypes not demonstrated in this pilot study (i.e. parainfluenza type 2 and 4, adenovirus type a and d-f), further study will be required to determine the performance of this novel platform. lastly, we only performed five repeats in the lod experiment, in which we utilized the 100% detection (5/5) criteria to determine the lod but not the 95% detection rule that generally applied in lod studies. althought the fewer repeats in our study may have limitation in precision of the lods, the 100% detection still should be considered a conservative estimate in this pilot study that could provide some evidence for futher studies.in conclusion, we demonstrated that the innovative rt-pcr/esi-ms technology could rapidly and accurately detect and subtype most viruses identified by conventional virological methods. detection of conventional viruses missed by clinical virology and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatatory testing to further determine the performance characteristics. the rt-pcr/esi-ms method is a promising diagnostic platform for the rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and merits further prospective evaluation. diagnostic algorithm used in clinical virology laboratory to detect respiratory viruses mainly divided into respiratory season or non-respiratory season. respiratory season defined as october to the following january (october to november for rsv, december to january for influenza). immunochromatographic assays were used in respiratory season as the sole screening test for rsv and influenza, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive. respiratory panel cocktail dfa tests serve for adenovirus, influenza a and b, parainfluenza type 1-3 and rsv, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive in non-respiratory season or for those screened negative by immunochromatographic assays in respiratory season as well. bocavirus that were not detectable in both clinical virology laboratory and another pcrbased platform were excluded (n=7). after further excluding 14 coronavirus and 3 humane metapneumovirusdetections that clinical virology laboratory had no protocol to detect, 257 were included in the primary performance analysis as in table 1. twenty-five samples for which clinical virology laboratory and rt-pcr/esi-ms did not agree or clinical virology laboratory has no protocol to detect with sufficient volume left were sent to another pcrbased assay for secondary analysis. seven clinically relevant viral pathogens (coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), influenza a and b, parainfluenza type 2 and 3, adenovirus, and coronavirus (sars)) were spiked into pooled negative npas tested by rt-pcr/esi-ms to determine the limit of detection (lod) with five repeats of serial of 2-fold dilutions from 1000 to 1 copies/well (1.3x 105 to 133 copies/ml). the rt-pcr/esi-ms was most sensitive in detecting adenovirus (lod: 7 copies/well) and least sensitive in detecting rsv (lod: 150 copies/ well). one copies/well is approximate to 133 copies/ml. overall agreement, sensitivity, and specificity, excluding those non-conventional viruses for which jhu has no identification protocols were 87.9 %, 77.9% and 92.1%, respectively.* excluding 24 viruses (14 coronavirus, 7 bocavirus, and 3 metapneumovirus), which were detected by rt-pcr/esi-ms for which clinical virology had no identification protocols.diagn microbiol infect dis. author manuscript; available in pmc 2012 february 1.acute respiratory tract infections (rtis), which are considered the "forgotten pandemic", remain the leading cause of all-cause mortality in children worldwide (bryce et al., 2005) . in spite of public health prevention measures and advances in therapeutics, incidence rates of rtis in the united states have varied little over the past 70 years (monto and ullman, 1974) , and etiologic diagnosis remains challenging. the lack of broad-based rapid and accurate diagnostic tools leads to overprescribing of antibiotics, delayed definitive diagnosis with potential for increased complications, and ineffective epidemic control.molecular diagnostic assays have the greatest potential for impacting clinical practice for infectious agents, such as viruses, where conventional microbiologic methods (i.e., culture) do not provide timely results (ratcliff et al., 2007) . while nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed for multiple individual viruses (liolios et al., 2001) , the utility in clinical settings has been further extended by the availability of single platform systems, which can simultaneously detect multiple pathogens (liao et al., 2009; pabbaraju et al., 2008; raymond et al., 2009; wu and tang, 2009) .electrospray ionization mass spectrometry following broad-range reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr/esi-ms), one of the single system platforms, has the potential to rapidly detect and semiquantify different pathogens simultaneously. to date, studies with rt-pcr/ emi-ms have been restricted to evaluation with individual respiratory bacteria and viruses [i.e., streptococcus , coronavirus (sars) , adenovirus (russell et al., 2006) , and influenza viruses (sampath et al., 2007) ], or detailed characterization [e.g. resistance gene recognition , genotyping of the organism ]. the capacity of rt-pcr/emi-ms for broad-range detection and rapid turnaround may provide a useful tool for clinicians in health care settings to aid in early diagnosis of rtis.we aimed to 1) demonstrate capacity of the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform to identify and subtype multiple respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates (npas) 2) and examine the performance characteristics of the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform in a pilot hospital-based retrospective proof-ofconcept study.seven clinically relevant viral pathogens [coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), influenza a and b, parainfluenza types 2 and 3, adenovirus, and coronavirus (sars)] were obtained from zeptometrix with given concentrations (buffalo, ny). pooled negative npas tested by rt-pcr/esi-ms were used for the mock-up experiments. to determine the limit of detection (lod), serial of 2-fold dilutions from 1000 to 1 genome copy/well (1.3 × 10 5 to 133 genome copies/ml) were spiked into the negative npas. each concentration was repeated 5 times independently to ensure the precision. the lod was determined by the least concentration for which 5 out of 5 repeats were detected by rt-pcr/esi-ms.clinical samples were derived from patients who presented with suspected rti in a tertiary inner-city teaching hospital according to a standardized collection procedure from may 2006 to november 2007. "excess" clinical samples were stored at −80°c until nucleic acid extraction.the microbiology database was queried for standard clinical virologic results including rapid immunochromatographic tests for influenza and rsv (binex now, inverness, bedford, uk), direct fluorescent antibody staining tests (d3 ultra dfa respiratory virus id kit, diagnostic hybrids, athens, oh), rapid shell vial culture identification (r-mix too, diagnostic hybrids, athens, oh), roller tube culture, and hemadsorption tests (fig. 1) . routine pcr testing was not performed in the clinical virology laboratory. two negative npas by clinical virology were obtained to match each positive sample in the same month of collection. the study was approved by the johns hopkins university institutional review board.samples were processed for total nucleic acid extraction using the thermo king-fisher (waltham, ma) robot according to an ambion (abi, foster city, ca) magmax viral kit extraction protocol. all samples were processed by a dedicated investigator (kc) who was masked to the clinical virology laboratory results at the time of processing.one-step rt-pcr was performed in a 5-μl reaction mix consisting of 4 u of amplitaq gold (applied biosystems, foster city, ca); 20 mmol/l tris, ph 8.3; 75 mmol/l kcl; 1.5 mmol/l mgcl 2 ; 0.4 mol/l betaine; 800 mmol/l mix of datp, dgtp, dctp, and dttp (bioline usa, randolph, ma); 10 mmol/l dithiothreitol; 100 ng sonicated polya dna (sigma, st. louis, mo); 40 ng random hexamers for the rt (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca); 1.2 u superasin (ambion, austin, tx); 400 ng t4 gene 32 protein (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in); 2 u superscript iii (invitrogen); 20 mmol/l sorbitol (sigma); and 250 nmol/l of each specific pcr primer. rt-pcr cycling conditions were 60°c for 5 min, 4°c for 10 min, 55°c for 45 min, 95°c for 10 min, followed by 8 cycles of 95°c for 30 s, 48°c for 30 s, and 72°c for 30 s, with the 48°c annealing temperature increasing 0.9°c each cycle. the rt-pcr was continued for 37 additional cycles of 95°c for 15 s, 56°c for 20 s, and 72°c for 20 s. the rt-pcr cycle ended with a final extension of 2 min at 72°c followed by a 4°c hold. rt-pcr was used for both rna and dna virus amplification.the assay was performed using the ibis t5000 respiratory virus surveillance ii kit (ibis biosciences, carlsbad, ca), designed to detect and subtype viruses from 7 groups: conventional viruses (rsv, influenza a and b, parainfluenza types 1-4, adenoviridae types a-f) and viruses not conventionally identified in our clinical virology laboratory (coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus). in this research-use-only kit, there were 16 primer pairs distributed in a 96-well plate, in which each well contained one pair of primers. most viruses had 2 primer sets, but there were 4 sets of primers for influenza viruses. each plate was able to test 6 patient samples with each specimen being tested in 16 wells.the ibis t5000 platform performed automated post-pcr desalting, esi-ms signal acquisition, spectral analysis, and data reporting to analyze rt-pcr product as described previously . briefly, the steps were as follows: 15-μl aliquots of each pcr reaction were desalted and purified using a weak anion exchange protocol as described elsewhere (ward et al., 2004) . accurate mass (61 ppm), high-resolution (m/dm.100 000 full-width halfmaximum) mass spectra were acquired for each sample using high-throughput esi-ms protocols described previously (sampath et al., 2007) . for each sample, approximately 1.5 μl of analyte solution was consumed during the 74-s spectral acquisition. raw mass spectra were post-calibrated with an internal mass standard and deconvolved to monoisotopic molecular masses. unambiguous base compositions were derived from the exact mass measurements of the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides. semiquan- fig. 1 . diagnostic algorithm of clinical virology laboratory for respiratory samples. diagnostic algorithm used in clinical virology laboratory to detect respiratory viruses mainly divided into respiratory season or nonrespiratory season. respiratory season defined as october to the following january (october to november for rsv, december to january for influenza). immunochromatographic assays were used in respiratory season as the sole screening test for rsv and influenza, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive. respiratory panel cocktail dfa tests serve for adenovirus, influenza a and b, parainfluenza types 1-3, and rsv, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive in nonrespiratory season or for those screened negative by immunochromatographic assays in respiratory season as well. rsv = respiratory syncytial virus; flu = influenza a or b viruses; piv = parainfluenza virus; hsv = herpes simplex virus; cmv = cytomegalovirus; hmpv = human metapneumovirus; dfa = direct fluorescent antibody test; cpe = cytopathic effect; rbc = red blood cells; id = identified. titative results of pathogens were obtained by comparing the peak heights with the internal pcr calibration internal mass standard present in every pcr well at 100 molecules, which was also treated as the internal positive control in each well. a negative control was implemented in each batch of processing with sterile viral transport media as well.our clinical virology laboratory does not perform pcr tests routinely for all respiratory viruses. accordingly, those samples for which clinical virology laboratory and rt-pcr/ esi-ms did not agree and which had enough remaining volume (200 μl) were sent to viracor (lee's summit, mo) for identification by another pcr-based platform (luminex respiratory assay, austin, tx), which is able to detect all the viruses rt-pcr/esi-ms could detect except for human bocavirus (pabbaraju et al., 2008) .sample throughput for rt-pcr/esi-ms, which included using 1 king/fisher extraction robot, 1 janus automated dispensing robot, 4 eppendorf thermocyclers, and 1 t5000 cleanup and injection automation system, was evaluated.for the primary analysis evaluating performance of rt-pcr/esi-ms, standard clinical virology laboratory results were used as the reference test. fig. 2 describes the number of subjects, each of which had one npa sample evaluated. the number of "evaluable results" was operationally defined for purposes of primary and secondary performance evaluation as the number of individual evaluable results that could be compared to one another because each npa sample could yield test results (by culture or rt-pcr/ms-esi) of "negative", single positive, or multiple viral detections (fig. 2) . in the secondary analysis, we combined clinical virology laboratory results and the secondary (i.e., luminex) pcr-based results as the reference test. samples containing viruses for which the hospital's clinical virology laboratory had no protocol available (i.e., bocavirus and coronavirus detection) were excluded from the primary analysis but included in the secondary analysis if the viral agent could be detected by the other (luminex) rt-pcrbased method (i.e., all viruses except bocavirus). confidence intervals (cis) for sensitivity and specificity were based on exact binomial probabilities. two-sample wilcoxon mann-whitney test was used for comparing the viral load in the clinical virology-positive group with the negative group.all the mocked npa samples in 7 viruses groups were detected successfully by the rt-pcr/esi-ms to the level of 150 copies/well (fig. 3) . the rt-pcr/esi-ms fig. 2 . flow diagram of patient recruitment and analysis. bocavirus that were not detectable in both clinical virology laboratory and another pcr-based platform were excluded (n = 7). after further exclusion of 14 coronavirus and 3 human metapneumovirus detections that clinical virology laboratory had no protocol for detection, 257 were included in the primary performance analysis as in table 1 . twenty-five samples for which clinical virology laboratory and rt-pcr/esi-ms did not agree or clinical virology laboratory has no protocol to detect with sufficient volume left were sent to another pcr-based assay for secondary analysis. was most sensitive in detecting adenovirus and least sensitive in detecting rsv (lod: 7 and 150 genome copies/well, respectively).a total of 274 examinable results from 280 npa samples collected from clinical virology previously frozen repository from march 2006 to november 2007 were identified, after excluding bocavirus detection unexaminable in both clinical virology diagnostic algorithm and the secondary pcr-based assay (fig. 2) . after exclusion, overall agreement was 87.9% (95% ci, 83.3-91.7%); sensitivity and specificity, excluding those nonconventional viruses for which johns hopkins university (jhu) has no identification protocols (14 coronavirus and 3 metapneumovirus), were 77.9% (95% ci, 68.2-85.8%) and 92.1% (95% ci, 86.9-95.7%), respectively (table 1) . among 257 samples for which results were available for the first accuracy analysis, 34 samples were found to disagree between rt-pcr/esi-ms and clinical virology laboratory.for individual pathogens identified in clinical virology, rt-pcr/esi-ms detected 98.9% rsv, 77.8% adenovirus, 70.3% parainfluenza, and 59.1% influenza viruses (table  2) . rt-pcr/esi-ms also successfully subtyped 8 influenza a, 5 influenza b, 2 parainfluenza type 1, and 14 parainfluenza type 3 that were identified by clinical virology, as well as 7 adenovirus types b and c that clinical virology had no protocol to subtype, but missubtyped 1 parainfluenza type 2 and 1 parainfluenza type 3, fig. 3 . lod of rt-pcr/esi-ms for respiratory viruses in npa mock-up samples. seven clinically relevant viral pathogens [coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), influenza a and b, parainfluenza types 2 and 3, adenovirus, and coronavirus (sars)] were spiked into pooled negative npas tested by rt-pcr/esi-ms to determine the lod with 5 repeats of serial of 2-fold dilutions from 1000 to 1 copies/well (1.3 × 10 5 to 133 copies/ml). the rt-pcr/ esi-ms was most sensitive in detecting adenovirus (lod: 7 copies/well) and least sensitive in detecting rsv (lod: 150 copies/well). one copy/well is approximate to 133 copies/ml. overall agreement, sensitivity, and specificity, excluding those nonconventional viruses for which jhu has no identification protocols, were 87.9%, 77.9%, and 92.1%, respectively. a excluding 24 viruses (14 coronavirus, 7 bocavirus, and 3 metapneumovirus), which were detected by rt-pcr/esi-ms for which clinical virology had no identification protocols. which were identified by the virology laboratory as parainfluenza type 3 and parainfluenza type 4, respectively. the median storage time was 10 months (range 7-19). viral load was semiquantifiable by rt-pcr/esi-ms and ranged from 2400 to n320 000 copies/ml. viral loads of rt-pcr/esi-ms-positive samples in the clinical virologynegative group were significantly lower than in the clinical virology-positive group (median 66 960 vs n320 000 copies/ml, respectively, p = 0.04).total examinable results were 260 (fig. 2) . among the 51 original samples with results in disagreement between rt-pcr/esi-ms and conventional virology assays or for which jhu had no protocols, 25 (43%) had sufficient volume to be sent to for another pcr-based method, 12 had confirmed rt-pcr/esi-ms results, including 7 positive conventional viruses (3 influenza a, 2 rsv, 2 parainfluenza). two coronavirus and 1 metapneumovirus detection not detectable by conventional clinical virology protocols were confirmed as well. the overall agreement, sensitivity, and specificity after secondary analysis of available samples were 90.7% (95% ci, 86.5-94.0%), 83.2% (95% ci, 74.4-90.0%), and 95.6% (95% ci, 91.1-98.2%), respectively (table 3) .time to first result from sample preparation to detection of rt-pcr/esi-ms was 8 h: 1 h of rna extraction, 4 h of rt-pcr, and 3 h of processing in esi-ms. the estimated throughput of rt-pcr/esi-ms was 300 samples with 2 technicians and 24 working hours, which represented 1080 pcr reactions.this study was a hospital-based retrospective pilot proof-of-concept study designed to demonstrate the capacity and to determine the performance of the novel rt-pcr/ esi-ms platform on mock-up samples and previously frozen clinical samples compared to clinical virology assays. our study showed that this novel assay was rapid and able to detect and subtype multiple respiratory pathogens in the hospital with 87.9% accuracy, compared to conventional clinical virology assays. our study also indicated that pathogens not detectable by traditional clinical virology methods could be successfully detected by the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform.the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform has several advantages including rapid turnaround time and a more detailed pathogen characterization (i.e., relative semiquantification, typing, and subtyping of species) versus conventional culture methods. the current common diagnostic methods in our clinical virology laboratory are culture-based, which may take days to yield results and are labor-intensive and expensive (anzueto and niederman, 2003) . although some rapid antigen tests offer faster detection times, their individual lower sensitivity and specificity limit their clinical utility as a sole methodology (ginocchio, 2007) . the rt-pcr/esi-ms platform has the capability to detect multiple pathogens efficiently and with high sensitivity, as well as the ability to determine the quantity of pathogens, which would be potential biomarkers of infection course or severity. however, further prospective validation study will be needed to determine clinical performance of this assay.while determining the performance of novel assays, similar problems have appeared for the discordant analysis of results between the new assays and reference standard tests. some researchers confirmed result of the novel assays discordant to the conventional culture or rapid antigen test by another multiplex rt-pcr assay (liolios et al., 2001;  pabbaraju et al., 2008) . it remains controversial regarding how to examine a potentially more accurate novel assay versus the current "alloyed" standard. doring et al. (2008) proposed that clinical evidence of infections should be included in the validation of the novel nucleic acid test; however, our study design did not permit detailed clinical data collection.we recognize several limitations of our design. first, the operation of rt-pcr/esi-ms was performed almost a year after the initial tests done in clinical virology. utilizing "excess" npa obtained from clinical virology resulted in some specimens not being processed until more than a year after collecting them from patients. although the effect of length of storage of npa has been shown to be minimal within 2 months (ward et al., 2004) , the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown. ward et al. (2004) demonstrated that multiple freezingthawing cycles did not significantly alter the concentrations measured before freezing the influenza samples, while frisbie et al. (2004) indicated influenza rna could degrade in the −70°c freezer and may result in some loss of sensitivity. the second limitation is that we could not send every specimen for secondary analyses because of insufficient volume of some samples. this is an inherent limitation of the retrospective design used here. however, because almost half of the discordant results was verified by another pcr-based method (12 out of 25), it might have little impact on the estimate. future study is merited to perform parallel comparison on every sample by another reference test (e.g., another pcr-based method) to better characterize the performance of the platform. third, we could not test the performance of rt-pcr/esi-ms on every subtype of clinically relevant respiratory viruses because of the design of the study. for those viral subtypes not demonstrated in this pilot study (i.e., parainfluenza types 2 and 4, adenovirus types a and d-f), further study will be required to determine the performance of this novel platform. lastly, we only performed 5 repeats in the lod experiment, in which we utilized the 100% detection (5/5) criteria to determine the lod but not the 95% detection rule that generally applied in lod studies. although the fewer repeats in our study may have limitation in precision of the lods, the 100% detection still should be considered a conservative estimate in this pilot study that could provide some evidence for further studies.in conclusion, we demonstrated that the innovative rt-pcr/esi-ms technology could rapidly and accurately detect and subtype most viruses identified by conventional virologic methods. detection of conventional viruses missed by clinical virology and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatory testing to further determine the performance characteristics. the rt-pcr/esi-ms method is a promising diagnostic platform for the rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and merits further prospective evaluation.identifying and determining the nature of interactions between multiple pathogens is increasingly considered critical to understanding infectious disease dynamics (e.g. pedersen & fenton 2007; graham 2008; telfer et al. 2010; johnson et al. 2015; gorsich et al. 2018) . individuals are often co-infected by a diverse infra-community of pathogens, and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection patterns (cattadori et al. 2008; lass et al. 2013; susi et al. 2015) and influence disease outcomes (moss et al. 2008; munson et al. 2008; knowles 2011; wejse et al. 2015) . pathogens infecting individuals in the first years of life may impact infection by subsequent pathogens (fenton 2008; randall et al. 2013; rynkiewicz et al. 2015; aivelo & norberg 2018; budischak et al. 2018) . for example endemic pathogens that compete for the same resources as epidemic pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection (randall et al. 2013) or, conversely, facilitate infection via immune suppression (e.g. geldmacher & koup 2012) . the sequence in which pathogens infect an individual or 'priority effects' have been experimentally shown to be important in shaping co-infection dynamics in a variety of systems (e.g. hoverman et al. 2013; halliday et al. 2017 ), yet are rarely demonstrated in non-experimental contexts. how priority effects and pathogen traits (e.g. transmission mode) affect the nature and frequency of associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens, ultimately shaping pathogen infra-communities is a knowledge gap that has significant consequences for understanding patterns of infection (munson et al. 2008; telfer et al. 2010; ezenwa & jolles 2015; halliday et al. 2017) .quantifying associations between pathogens from observational data and inferring interactions from these patterns, however, is a methodological challenge . discriminating between positive (i.e. two pathogens are more likely to occur together) or negative associations (i.e. two pathogens are less likely to occur together) between pathogens in populations is complicated by the short time window that a pathogen is shedding (and thus detectable with molecular methods) and by potentially confounding host immune environments (tompkins et al. 2011) . this is particularly the case for microparasites where pathogen detection often relies on serology, and, thus, without resampling the same individual, the precise timing of exposure cannot be estimated. detection of pathogens that form chronic infections may be more straightforward as the infection is active for longer periods, but deducing pathogen associations is difficult without extensive longitudinal data hellard et al. 2015) . identifying whether two pathogens are associated due to host-habitat preferences, the increasing likelihood of exposure with age, or are a product of a negative (e.g. competition) or positive (e.g. facilitation) interactions is methodologically challenging (poulin 2007; johnson & buller 2011; fenton et al. 2014; hellard et al. 2015; clark et al. 2016) . identifying associations that could represent candidate interactions based on observational data can not only provide a basis for experiments to test potential interactions but also provide novel insights into pathogen infra-community dynamics.detecting associations between pathogens is also likely to depend on taxonomic and spatial scales that are seldom considered (ara ujo & rozenfeld 2014; stutz et al. 2018) . studies commonly aggregate pathogen data to genus level, but associations between pathogens can be subtype or genotype-specific (e.g. wejse et al. 2015; benesh & kalbe 2016; brook et al. 2017) . for example individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 (hiv-1) are four times more likely to become co-infected with tuberculosis compared to individuals with hiv-2 (wejse et al. 2015) . beyond subtype or genus, genotype-specific associations have been demonstrated in snails infected by trematodes (louhi et al. 2015) and in rodents infected by bartonella bacteria (brook et al. 2017) . infra-community dynamics are also likely to vary with spatiotemporal scale. in general, associations between free-living species are more apparent at scales where interactions occur compared to broader spatiotemporal scales (eltonian noise hypothesis; peterson et al. 2011; ara ujo & rozenfeld 2014) , but it remains unclear if this is true for pathogens. nonetheless, for cross-sectional datasets, important patterns may be missed unless multiple spatiotemporal scales are considered (ovaskainen et al. 2017) . to overcome these challenges, analytical approaches that can quantify associations between pathogens, whilst controlling for potential confounding factors are required to assess the role of associations in shaping pathogen infra-communities.recent applications of network theory to parasite community ecology provide an opportunity to move beyond the pairwise associations between two pathogens (clark et al. 2016; aivelo & norberg 2018; stutz et al. 2018) . network measures have frequently been used to study food webs but are increasingly applied to pathogen infra-communities where nodes are pathogens, and edges represent pathogen co-occurrences within the host (vaumourin et al. 2015) . networks are modular if pathogens co-occur more frequently in particular groups, 'nested' if pathogens frequently share interaction partners across the network, or 'segregated' if the inverse is true (strona & veech 2015; ulrich et al. 2017 ). if, for example networks are segregated, targeted control of one 'keystone' pathogen may lead to co-extinction of other pathogens in a module (pedersen & fenton 2007; s€ aterberg et al. 2013) . if a network is nested, perturbations to the pathogen infra-community may spread throughout the network (griffiths et al. 2014) .although pathogen co-occurrence networks are valuable for quantifying broad structural patterns, they do not account for environmental or host factors, pathogen traits or differences in spatial or temporal scale. joint species distribution models (jsdms) fill this gap by simultaneously assessing environmental influences and interspecific co-occurrences across multiple scales using hierarchical bayesian mixed models (warton et al. 2015; ovaskainen et al. 2017 ). here we use both co-occurrence networks and jsdms to examine the structure of pathogen-pathogen networks and quantify pathogen associations while controlling for environmental/host factors and scales. we include information on pathogen traits such as transmission mode to assess what role they played in the distribution of each pathogen. we collate 10 years of cross-sectional data on endemic and epidemic pathogens in 105 african lions (panthera leo) as well as extensive host and environmental data from the serengeti lion project (slp, packer et al. 2005) . the slp datasets provide a unique opportunity to understand pathogen co-occurrence networks in a wild population while controlling for group, individual and environmental characteristics. we use this data to ask the following interlinked questions at two levels of taxonomic resolution:(i) to what degree is the pathogens' co-occurrence network of serengeti lions nested or segregated? (ii) after accounting for environmental/host factors and spatiotemporal scale, is the type of endemic pathogen an individual is infected by early in life associated with exposure to epidemic pathogens later in life? (iii) are there significant endemic-endemic or epidemic-epidemic pathogen co-occurrences?because we could not directly determine the order of infection events from cross-sectional data in isolation, we used age-prevalence relationships in combination with the natural history of each pathogen to estimate probable timing of events. we describe an analytical pathway that can assess broad network structure and quantify pathogen associations across multiple scales that can generally be applied to understand infectious disease dynamics. the co-occurrence network detects clusters of pathogen sharing amongst individuals and screens for disconnected nodes (pathogens that rarely co-occur with others), while the jsdm approach was used to quantify pathogen-pathogen associations. to assess the plausibility of these putative interactions, we compare our findings to similar mammalian pathogens in experimental studies. detecting pathogen co-occurrences not only provides novel insights into pathogen infra-community dynamics but also helps aide surveillance efforts in the field and generate testable hypotheses that can be answered in laboratory experiments.serological testing and quantitative pcr (qpcr) were performed to detect endemic and epidemic pathogens from blood samples taken from lions in the serengeti national park, tanzania from 1984 to 1994. in total, 394 individuals were sampled throughout this period, but our analysis was restricted to the 105 individuals tested for the full suite of 10 pathogens (table 1: pathogen natural history; table s1 : number of individuals tested per year included in the analyses). nomadic individuals (i.e. lions that were not resident in any pride) were excluded due to the difficulty of assigning environmental variables (see confounding variables below). serological data on canine distemper virus (cdv), feline calicivirus, parvovirus and coronavirus has been published previously, except rift valley fever (rvf) (packer et al. 1999 , see table s2 for assay details). to detect rvf exposure we conducted a plaque reduction virus neutralizing test (prnt) that quantified virus neutralizing antibodies from serum following scott et al.(1986) protocol.we used qpcr to identify nucleotides for feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv ple ) and the protozoan pathogens in this study (table 1) . three distinct subtypes of fiv ple co-circulate in serengeti lions (troyer et al. 2005 (troyer et al. , 2011 antunes et al. 2008 ) and thus subtype specific qpcr was performed (see troyer et al. 2004 troyer et al. , 2005 for qpcr protocols). the resultant 300 base pair sequences from the pol gene were aligned and assigned to 21 operational taxonomic units/genotypes based on a 95% molecular similarity threshold (see fountain-jones et al. 2017 for details). lions also commonly get infected by a rich protozoan fauna including babesia and hepatazoon genera. we developed quantitative pcr protocols using density gel gradient electrophores is to identify each protozoan species (see munson et al. 2008) .we categorised each pathogen as likely endemic or epidemic in the lion population: endemic pathogens were considered to be constantly circulating and often infecting the young while epidemic pathogens sweep through the population every few years infecting all age classes (packer et al. 1999; penzhorn 2006; troyer et al. 2011) . many of the pathogens have been previously classified as endemic or epidemic (packer et al. 1999) . we supported our classification with age-prevalence plots (fig. s1 ) and we plotted yearly prevalence ( fig. s2 ) for the pathogens not previously classified. pathogens with a high prevalence at a young age (≤ 2 years old) with little fluctuation across all years and age classes were considered to be likely endemic, whereas an increasing age-prevalence relationship and high temporal variation were classified as more likely to be epidemic in this population. feline coronavirus can have epidemic and endemic cycles, and it is challenging to assess which form the individual was infected with from serological data, but based on age-prevalence relationships we categorised coronavirus as an endemic infection (fig. s1 ). furthermore, we used patterns of ageprevalence to infer the potential timing of infections. as most individual lions were likely to be infected by the pathogens we considered endemic within the first 2 years after birth (troyer et al. 2011, fig . s1), we assume that endemic exposure typically occurred prior to exposure by an epidemic pathogen. we partitioned the endemic pathogen data into two sets based on taxonomic resolution (high and medium). the high taxonomic resolution dataset encompassed fiv ple genotype and babesia species data, whereas the medium resolution dataset aggregated fiv ple subtype information and babesia data to genus level.we examined pathogen co-occurrence patterns to evaluate preferential associations among pathogens. we constructed co-occurrence networks for each taxonomic resolution as well as for pathogens tested for using qpcr and by serology in cases combining both lines of diagnostic evidence led to altered network structure. to do so, we first built an m 9 n matrix that described presences/absences (i.e. occurrences) of both endemic and epidemic pathogens across individual lions, where m was the number of individual lions and n the number of pathogens. by multiplying it by its transpose, we then created a summary n 9 n co-occurrence matrix that described, for each pair of pathogens, the number of observed co-occurrences across all individual lions. pathogens detected infrequently in this lion population were included in this analysis to help screen for pathogens disconnected in the network. the co-occurrence matrix was used to evaluate which pathogens were carried by the same individuals utilizing a modularitybased 'greedy' approach (clauset et al. 2004 ). measures of modularity aim to determine the adequacy of different classification schemes in representing clusters and divisions in datasets; here, the clusters represented the co-occurrence of pathogens in individual hosts. estimates of modularity were calculated for each possible classification by comparing the expected fraction of pathogen co-occurrence to random cooccurrences (newman 2006) . the classification with the highest modularity from all the generated classifications was selected.we then computed a measure of network structure (ɲ ̅ ) and modularity index based on node overlap and segregation (strona & veech 2015; ulrich et al. 2017) . ɲ ̅ ranges from scaled from à1 (entirely segregated network) to 1 (entirely nested network). these analyses were performed in r using the 'igraph' and 'nos' libraries (cs ardi & nepusz 2006; strona & veech 2015) . the co-occurrence matrix was obtained from the incidence matrix using the graph.incidence and the bipartite.projection functions. the classification analysis was performed using the fastgreedy.community function in igraph (cs ardi & nepusz 2006) .joint species distribution models are a flexible multivariate extension of generalised linear mixed models that can examine how environment (and host) shape multiple species simultaneously across biological scales (ovaskainen et al. 2017; bj€ ork et al. 2018) . jsdms can quantify associations between species across scales using latent factor models to estimate species-species covariance for each random effect (ovaskainen et al. 2017; bj€ ork et al. 2018) . we fitted jsdms for both high and medium taxonomic resolution datasets, combining information on environmental and host covariates as fixed effects (see confounding variables below for details), to the occurrence data for each of the pathogens. pathogens detected fewer than five times were excluded from this analysis leaving 10 pathogens in the medium taxonomic model and 17 in the high-resolution dataset. including pathogens with fewer than five occurrences may lead to spurious associations (ovaskainen et al. 2017) . we fitted all the jsdms with bayesian inference, using 'hierarchical modelling of species communities' (blanchet et al. 2018) . for each analysis, we modelled the response pathogen co-occurrence matrix using a probit model based on the approach outlined in ovaskainen et al. (2016) . in contrast to the network approach, the jsdm co-occurrence matrix is a product of the pathogen-to-pathogen variance-covariance matrix estimated for each random effect (e.g. pride-year) in the model. each random effect (and thus each estimated co-occurrence matrix) measures a component of the variation in the response that is different than the other random effects and of the set of explanatory variables (fixed effects) considered in the model. in our models, we added individual (e.g. sex and age), pride and environmental characteristics (see confounding variables below) as fixed effects. individual sampled, pride-year (i.e. which pride and year the individual was sampled in) and year-landscape (i.e. what year was the individual sampled in the serengeti) sampled were added as random effects. as pathogen traits may shape the distribution of each pathogen (e.g. similar environmental and host variables may shape tick-borne pathogens), we included traits such as pathogen type (see table 1 ) in each analysis. we utilised the default priors (described in full detail in ovaskainen et al. 2017) and ran the hmsc model twice using 3 million mcmc samples (the first 300 000 of which being burn-in). each run was carried out using a different seed. visual inspection of mcmc traces and the gelman-rubin diagnostic calculated to assess convergence. in addition, we made sure that the effective sample size (ess) of each parameter was > 200.as part of the slp, most of the individuals in this study have been regularly observed since birth ). we selected 13 predictor variables that we thought were likely to be important for pathogen exposure and thus could confound possible associations patterns (table 2 ). we included variables that captured individual variability (e.g. age at sampling), and pride characteristics including environmental variables (e.g. average vegetation cover of the pride's territory; see table 2 for measurement details).the serengeti lions were exposed to an average of 5 pathogens (two epidemic and three endemic, sd = 1); one individual had been infected by 9 of 10 pathogens (based on medium resolution data, fig. s3 ). cubs between 1 and 2 years old were often already infected with an average of four pathogens (sd = 1), with one 1.5 years old cub positive for 5. all lions were qpcr positive for at least one protozoan species, and 25% of them were infected by all four protozoans tested.pathogen co-occurrence networks are highly nestedthe high taxonomic resolution summary network indicated a significantly nested architecture (ɲ ̅ = 0.74) with relatively low modularity (modularity index = 0.393, z = 3.307, p ≤ 0.001) with three clusters (fig. 1a) . the largest cluster (green nodes) included all of the protozoans, epidemic pathogens and some fiv ple genotypes, whereas the remaining two clusters consisted of fiv ple genotypes (fig. 1a) . when we modelled networks based on diagnostic test, the general pattern did not substantially change, with the exception that rvf clustered separately from the other viruses detected using serology. in both network formulations, phylogenetically similar genotypes of fiv did not cluster together (fountain-jones et al. 2017, see fig. s5 ). in contrast, the medium resolution network was completely nested with no modularity (ɲ ̅ = 1, modularity index = 0, z = ∞, p = 0) and no significant clusters (fig. 1b) .after accounting for environmental, individual and pride factors and scale, the jsdm analysis identified strong associations between pathogens (fig. 2 ) that were not detected in the summary co-occurrence network. including individual, pride-year and landscape-year scales in our co-occurrence models was important as our ability to detect associations varied. at an individual and pride-year level, we detected strong associations between a small subset of epidemic and endemic pathogens. fiv ple b and hepatozoon felis were negatively associated with rvf (fig. 2) , and fiv ple b was also negatively associated with parvovirus ( fig. 2a and fig. s6a ). however, these associations could only be detected at medium taxonomic resolution. in contrast, at high taxonomic resolution, we identified positive associations between b. gibsoni and rvf that were not detected at medium-resolution.the strongest associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens were detected at the lowest spatial-temporal resolution (landscape-year). in the high taxonomic resolution model, pathogens separated into two groups with each group having a very similar association profile. one group was characterised by positive associations between the babesia species, fiv ple c2, cdv and parvovirus. the other group was characterised by positive associations between two fiv ple genotypes (c1 & b2), coronavirus, h. felis and calicivirus (figs. 2c and fig. s6c ). there were strong negative associations between pathogens in each separate group (e.g. cdv and fiv ple c1). generally, the same associations held in the medium taxonomic resolution models ( fig. 2c and fig. s6c ), but there were exceptions. for example fiv ple c1 and c2 had opposing association profiles, but as fiv ple c1 had a higher prevalence (fig. s7) , c1 had the same overall association profile as fiv ple c.associations between epidemic pathogens were rare. at the year-level, we detected positive associations between cdv and parvovirus with both pathogens negatively associated with calicivirus ( fig. 2c and fig. s6c ). in contrast, associations between the endemic pathogens were common, but the nature of the associations also differed at each taxonomic scale. for example in the medium resolution model, we detected a positive association between h. felis and fiv ple c not found in the high-resolution model indicating that fiv ple subtype, but not genotype, was important for this association (fig. 2b and  fig. s6b) . strikingly, we found that fiv ple subtypes had contrasting association profiles. at the individual level, fiv ple b and c were negatively associated with each other, and fiv ple c was positively associated with coronavirus, whereas fiv ple b was negatively associated with coronavirus ( fig. 2a and  fig. s6a ). both high and medium taxonomic resolution jsdms had reasonable explanatory power (tjur r 2 = 0.381 & 0.330, respectively). in both models, the landscape and host factors that explained the distribution of each pathogen were not predicted well by pathogen traits (fig. s8 ). see fig. 3 for a summary of all of the associations detected across scales from our cross-sectional data and figs s9/s10 for model details.here we demonstrate non-random associations in the pathogens infecting wild african lions, with both negative and positive associations detected between endemic and epidemic pathogens. while there was minimal structure in the cooccurrence network (fig. 1a) , we uncovered structure after accounting for scale and controlling for potentially confounding environmental and host variables (fig. 2) . using ageprevalence relationships we could assess the likely order of infection using cross-sectional data. we found that the particular endemic pathogen an individual is infected by as a cub may have consequences for which novel epidemic pathogen the individual is infected with later in life (fig. 3) . we emphasise that the approach used here can start to untangle pathogen infra-community relationships and identify potential endemic-epidemic associations in wild populations. these can then be compared with knowledge of pathogen pathogenesis and validated in-vitro in a laboratory setting. while clinical or *we calculated this predictor 2 years prior to sampling to account for differences in individual status at a potential time of exposure or infection (e.g. individuals that had just immigrated into a pride when sampled were considered nomads as exposure or infection was likely to have occurred previously). †we averaged over past 2 years to reduce the variability in pride counts as exposure was unlikely to have happened during the sampling year.laboratory studies of co-infection in lions are rare for good reason, the associations we found have clear precedence in similar pathogens co-infecting humans and represent plausible interactions. our results not only provide new insights on pathogen community structure in the serengeti lions but also provide a valuable framework for exploring pathogen cooccurrence networks and infra-community dynamics. co-occurrence networks were highly nested with relatively low modularity, particularly at a medium taxonomic resolution. nonetheless, rvf did cluster separately from the other pathogens tested via serology which potentially indicates that rvf, unlike the other epidemic viruses, has a distinct epidemic cycle with most of the interacting partners being more chronic pathogens. this is supported by the rvf association profile detected in our jsdm analysis and is intuitive given that rvf is the only mosquito-borne pathogen that we sampled. even though we sampled pathogens considered important for lion health, we lacked data on other potentially pathogenic bacteria, helminths and fungi that the lions were exposed to or potentially infected by. furthermore, symbiont interactions can also be important in shaping pathogen dynamics (e.g. halliday et al. 2017 ) and could be considered in pathogen infra-community studies. these additional taxa may lead to further segregation in the network, as larger and more diverse networks typically show increased modularity and segregation (thebault & fontaine 2010; sauve et al. 2014) . expanding sampling to construct a more complete microbe and macroparasite network would also capture a broader array of potentially facilitative and competitive associations (ezenwa 2016; aivelo & norberg 2018) .after accounting for environment, host and scale, we found that the endemic pathogens were strongly associated with the epidemic pathogens and, based on mammalian laboratorybased experiments, suggest that these patterns represent plausible interactions between pathogens. for example we detected negative associations between endemic pathogens (fiv ple b and h. felis) and rvf after accounting for differences between individuals. co-infections between bunyaviruses like rvf and retroviruses are likely common in humans and wildlife, though there are surprisingly few studies addressing the topic. in contrast, relationships between dengue virus (a flavivirus) and hiv are relatively well understood. flaviviruses and hiv share similar immune receptors that can inhibit hiv replication and the molecular machinery used to do so may be a viable way to control hiv infection (e.g. xiang et al. 2009 ). given the overall structural similarity of flaviviruses and bunyaviruses (hernandez et al.2014) , it is possible that a similar mechanism underlies the association in lions between rvf and fiv ple that we observed, although we show that this association was subtype specific. if this was true, rvf might inhibit fiv ple b infection - fig. 1 pathogen summary co-occurrence network for (a) high taxonomic resolution and (b) medium taxonomic resolution data, where nodes are pathogens and edges reflect co-occurrence. edges are shown only when there were ≥ 3 co-occurrences. node colours reflect separate clusters. edge weights are proportional to the number of co-occurrences. pathogen labels in bold (in boxes) were considered epidemic. see fig. s4 for networks of pathogens detected via qpcr and serology separately. counter to our assumption that endemic pathogens in our system infected each individual first (fig. 3) .the greatest number of associations between epidemic and endemic pathogens were detected when we included differences across years (year-landscape scale) in our analysis. these associations could represent plausible facilitative or competitive interactions. cdv and babesia are well-known to interact with high levels of babesia infection magnifying the impacts of consequent t-cell depletion caused by cdv infection leading to mortality of nearly 40% of the lion population in 1994 (munson et al. 2008) . we found that all tick-borne haemoparasites showed positive associations with cdv including b. leo (with insert) despite its low prevalence in 1993/1994 (fig. s9) . parvovirus was also positively associated with cdv, but this was likely due to similarities in timings of epidemics with a parvovirus epidemic in 1992 just before the 1994 cdv epidemic (packer et al. 1999) . parvoviruses are also immune suppressive, and so the timing of the parvovirus outbreak may also have contributed to the cdv/babesiainduced mortality. the general negative relationship between fiv ple c and cdv/babesia supports the theory that individuals infected by subtype c were more likely to die in the consequent babesia/cdv outbreak (troyer et al. 2011) . thus, this negative association may not be due to competition between pathogens but rather to mortality.our approach detected strong associations between the endemic pathogens also. for example there were opposing associations between the fiv ple subtypes and coronavirus (fig. 2) .negative associations between retroviruses and coronaviruses are rarely reported, yet there are plausible molecular pathways. hiv-1 and human coronaviruses (hcov) share remarkably similar binding receptors (chan et al. 2006 ) and some mild hcov strains are even considered a viable vaccine against hiv (eriksson et al. 2006) . this may explain the negative association we detected for fiv ple b and coronavirus but does not explain the positive association between fiv ple c and coronavirus we detected across scales. the mechanism driving fiv ple subtype specific relationships with coronaviruses remain unclear, and as coronaviruses infecting lions are also likely to be genetically diverse, examining the genetic structure of coronavirus may help untangle these associations further. in contrast, competitive associations between hiv strains are well characterised with hiv-1 found to outcompete hiv-2 for blood resources (ari€ en et al. 2005) . for fiv ple , even though co-infection is relatively common (troyer et al. 2011 ) competition between subtypes could be important as there is anecdotal cell culture evidence that fiv ple b can propagate more rapidly than fiv ple c (m. roelke, unpublished data).there were also contrasting associations between the protozoan species. for example the distribution of b. felis was not shaped by any other protozoan and in general, had a narrow association profile (fig. 2) , unlike the other babesia species. for the individuals co-infected by protozoans, associations involving b. felis were also common, whereas co-infections involving h. felis and the other babesia species varied in prevalence and composition (fig. s9) . even though b. gibsoni and b. only associations with posterior coefficient estimates ≥ 0.4 with 95% credible intervals that do not cross 0 are shown. the light red line indicates the association between hepatozoon felis and cdv that was ≥ 0.4 in the medium resolution model but was below the threshold (0.38) in the high-resolution model. pathogens in bold and in boxes are the epidemic viruses (all other pathogens are likely endemic). this figure was drawn using the r package 'circleplot' (westgate 2016) . see fig. s6 for association matrices and figs s9/s10 for covariate partitioning and effect size.felis show similar age prevalence profiles (fig. s1) , the prevalence of b. felis over time was relatively stable compared to the other protozoa (fig. s10) . differences in the host range for individual babesia species and potential host differences in virulence may partially explain these patterns. for example b. felis has only ever been detected in felids, whereas b. gibsoni has a much broader host range including canids (penzhorn 2006) . generalist pathogens may have greater pathogenicity as there can be reduced selective restraint on virulence particularly in 'dead end' hosts (woolhouse et al. 2001 ). if more pathogenic species are more likely to interact with other pathogens compared to less virulent pathogens is an open question in disease ecology. importantly, patterns like these would be missed without incorporating high-resolution pathogen data.there are, however, limitations to this approach. the inability to distinguish mortality or correlated exposure (i.e. an individual is infected by multiple pathogens in the same transmission event) from negative or positive associations is one of them, and careful interpretation of associations is necessary. incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underlie candidate pathogen associations (carver et al. 2015) could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies. another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely. for example the negative association between rvf and h. felis could be due to temporal differences when ticks and mosquitoes emerge after rains. years with higher rainfall increase mosquito abundance thus increasing rvf prevalence (fig. s2) , whereas ticks emerge en masse when rains follow a dry period potentially increasing h. felis prevalence (munson et al. 2008) . as rainfall was calibrated to the year of sampling rather than the age of infection (which could differ) the jsdm approach could not capture this variation. studies using longitudinal data to quantify associations using a similar framework to ours (e.g. telfer et al. 2010; henrichs et al. 2016 ) will be beneficial as they are likely to provide more robust estimates of the order of infection in wild populations. furthermore, we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density. lastly, incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and jsdm analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure (griffiths et al. 2014) . higher resolution pathogen traits, such as duration of infection, are likely to provide further mechanistic insight into how and why pathogens co-occur as they do in free-living communities (ulrich et al. 2017) . however, given the daunting complexity of pathogen infra-community dynamics, our two-step approach can assess broad network structure and identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity.the high frequency of co-occurrence and co-infection in lionsand the potential for specific associations to cause population declinehighlights the importance of understanding pathogen associations. the lion pathogen co-occurrence network was highly connected with both positive and negative associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens. our findings indicate that the lion pathogen infra-community is influenced by a number of ecological factors and associations between pathogens. we identify useful associations between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity. more broadly, our work demonstrates how different network approaches can be combined to gain insights into the ecological factors underlying pathogen associations and how this can be applied to the study of pathogen communities in wildlife populations. in addition to these biological insights, the study highlights several critical areas for methodological improvement fig. 3 summary of the strong positive (red line/arrows) and negative (blue lines/arrows) associations between endemic (grey circles) and epidemic (orange circles) pathogens in the serengeti lions; dark-grey borders indicate protozoa. the direction of the red or blue arrows indicates the potential sequence of infection events. the black arrow along the x-axis represents age; the circles reflect the ages when lions were likely to be infected by each pathogen (based on age-exposure data rather than longitudinal data, see fig. s1 ). dashed circles indicate major co-occurrence clusters identified at the landscape-year scale. that can currently limit robust inference of pathogen associations from cross-sectional serological and qpcr data. addressing these limitations is timely, given the ongoing threat of wildlife population decline, creating a need to integrate better molecular, ecological and network information for disease control.alpha interferons (ifn-␣) are the first cytokines discovered. they are produced as a first line of defense against viral infection by inducing genes, including 2 ,5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5-oas), rnase l, guanylate binding protein, mxa protein and the dsrna-dependent protein kinase (pkr) (samuel, 2001) , which interfere with viral replication and activate natural killer cells. ifns play an important role in the host antiviral response but are also recognized for their antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities (issacs and lindenman, 1957; fleischmann et al., 1998; biron, 1998 biron, , 2001 . they are encoded by an intronless multigene family, and widely distributed among the vertebrates, and share a same receptor. multiple genes encod-ing ifn-␣ subtypes have been identified in several mammalian species, including human, equine, bovine, canine and murine species (roberts et al., 1998) . more than 10 different subtypes of ifn-␣ have been reported in mice and 15 or more subtypes in humans (roberts et al., 1997 (roberts et al., , 1998 diaz et al., 1994) .the giant panda (ailuropoda melanoleuca) is indigenous to china (chen, 1997) . except for man's encroachment on the territories of giant panda, diseases are probably the greatest threats. although effective measures have been carried out to protect giant panda in breeding and reproduction, prevention and control of infectious diseases, especially virus diseases, it is still an arduous and pressing task. recently, canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine adenovirus, minute virus, parainfluenza virus have been detected in giant panda (tennant et al., 1993; he et al., 2000; gao et al., 2003; qiao et al., 2004) . in china, xia and he had separated canine distemper virus and coronavirus from liver of giant panda, respectively. therefore, it is very important to study the immune system of giant panda, especially immune function genes. so we have cloned the genes coding for the ifn-␣ and expressed them in eukaryotic cells and tested their biological activities which could be attributable to enhance the survival ability of giant panda.escherichia coli jm109 used in this study was kept in our lab. the pmdt-18 and pcdna3.1 (+) vector were purchased from takara and clontech, respectively.human embryonic kidney cells (293 cell), hela cells, b16 melanoma cells, mdbk cells were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 100 iu/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml of streptomycin. k562 cells were cultured in rpmi 1640 (gibco., usa) with 10% fbs.genomic dna was extracted from liver sample of giant panda (natural death, sichuan, baoxing, china) by using dna isolation kit (takara) and used as template to clone giant panda ifn-␣ genes following polymerase chain reaction (pcr) strategy. the primers for giant panda (a. melanoleuca) ifn-␣ (amifn-␣) were designed corresponding to conserved regions of carnivora. the sequences of forward and reverse primers were 5 -atggc (cg) ctgccct (cg) (tc) tccttc-ttggtg-3 and 5 -tcatttct (ct) (gc) ctccta (acg) tctttcttgc-3 , respectively. all primers used for pcr and sequencing were made by sangon inc., china.amplification of giant panda genomic ifn-␣ was carried out by pcr in a final volume of 50 l containing 1× buffer, 0.2 m of each dntps, 500 nm primers, 200 ng of dna, and 1 u/ml pfu high fidelity dna polymerase (takara). the amplification profile included one initial denaturation step at 94 • c for 5 min, then 30 cycles using the following conditions: 94 • c for 45 s, 58 • c for 45 s, and 72 • c for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 • c for 10 min.pcr products from 1% agarose gel were purified with a recover kit (omega, china) and ligated into pmdt-18 vector. the ligated products were proliferated in escherichia coli jm109 cells and the resulted plasmids were followed pcr verification and enzymatic digestion with ecori and hindiii (takara, china).coding fragments of the amifn-␣ subtype clones were sub-cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pcdna3.1 (+) as followings. the plasmid of each ifn-␣ subtype was used as template for pcr with the primers containing bamhi and xhoi restriction sites at the 5 and 3 ends, respectively. the sequences of the forward and reverse primers were 5 -cgggatcc-aacatggcgctgccct (gc) (tc) tcctt-3 and 5 -ccgctcgagtcatttct (tc) (gc) ctccttagtctt-3 , respectively. aacatg is a bona fide kozak consensus sequence for translation. the pcr conditions included a 5 min denaturation step at 94 • c, followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 • c, 45 s at 58 • c, and 1 min at 72 • c. a final extension for 10 min at 72 • c was then performed. the resulted fragments were purified, digested with bamhi and xhoi and ligated into the corresponding cloning sites of pcdna3.1 (+) vector. every recombinant plasmid was confirmed by sequencing and named as pamifn-␣1, pamifn-␣2, pamifn-␣3, pamifn-␣4, pamifn-␣5, pamifn-␣6, pamifn-␣7, pamifn-␣8, pamifn-␣9, pamifn-␣10, pamifn-␣11, and pamifn-␣12. minipreparations of the plasmids were obtained using the endofree plasmid mini kit (omega).human embryonic kidney cells (hek293 cell) were seeded at 2 × 10 5 cells/100 mm dish in dmem, and incubated at 37 • c in a co 2 incubator until the cells reached approximately 50-80% confluence. amifn-␣ plasmid dna (2 g) was diluted in 100 l serum-free and antibiotic-free dmem while mixed gently. six microliters of liposome sofast (xiame, china) were mixed gently with 94 l serum-free and antibiotic-free dmem and then the mixture was added to 100 l dna solutions drop wise with vortex. the mixtures were incubated at room temperature (rt) for 20 min. the dna-liposome complexes were overlaid on top of the cells and incubated at 37 • c for additional 72 h.sds-page was performed with 5% stacking gel and 12% (v/v) resolving gel and the proteins were visualized by silver staining. after sds-page, the proteins were transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane from gel without staining. the membrane was blocked with 3% bas in tbs (2 m tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 10 mm nacl) at room temperature for 2 h. the blot was washed 3× 10 min with tbs, followed by an overnight incubation with a mouse anti-human ifn-␣ monoclonal (abcam) that was at diluted 1:100 in blocking solution (tbs with 0.5% bsa). after washing 3× 10 min with tbs, the blot was incubated with a goat anti-mouse igg conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in tbs with 0.5% bsa (diluted 1:5000). finally, nitrocellulose sheets were washed (3× 10 min) with tbs (briones and maria, 2003) . blots were incubated with this solution for 1-3 min. the reaction was stopped with tap water, and the blots were dried with paper towels and stored away from light at room temperature.supernatants collected from transfected 293 cells were treated at ph 2 for 24 h at 4 • c, or for 1 h at 65 • c, respectively. antiviral activities were compared between treated and untreated samples.the antiviral activity of amifn-␣ was determined in vitro by utilizing a standard vsv assay as previously described with minor changes (vogel et al., 1991; wonderling et al., 2002) . the antiviral activity of amifn-␣ was assayed in a cytopathic effect reduction assay using mdbk cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) in 96-well microtiter plates. briefly, mdbk cells were seeded into 96-well plate in a concentration of 5 × 10 4 cells/ml. after 24 h, serial dilutions containing ifn-␣ supernatants were added to 96-well plates, and each sample had three replicates. after cells were incubated for 24 h, the supernatants were removed and the cells were infected with vsv at 4 × 10 4 plaque forming unit (pfu/ml). after 24 h, cells were washed three times with pbs and stained with methyl violet solution. the cells were then washed with deionized water and allowed to dry. the methyl violet was eluted with 100 ml of methanol and absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a microplate reader 3550 (bio-rad, usa). the activity of giant panda interferon-␣ was shown as the reciprocal of the dilution leading to 50% cytopathic effect. the supernatants of pcdna3.1 (+) and purified human ifn-␣2b (zhongshan, china) were as negative control and positive control, respectively. these activities were normalized to the activity calculated for amifn-␣6 in the same experiment and corrected for the quantification of the amount of ifn measured in the supernatants.the antiproliferative activity of amifn-␣ was determined as previously described (van pesch et al., 2004) with minor changes. b16 melanoma and k562 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well, respectively. after 24 h, serial dilutions of the ifn-containing supernatants (100 l) were added to the cells. after incubation for 72 h, the cell density were quantified by using the wst-1 cell proliferation reagent (biorot, nanjing, china). briefly, 10 l of wst-1 (10 mg/ml) were added per well and incubated for 2 h at 37 • c. absorbance was read at 450 nm. the activity of amifn-␣ was shown as the reciprocal of the dilution leading to 50% inhibition of cell proliferation. the supernatants of pcdna3.1 (+) and purified human ifn-␣2b (zhongshan, china) were as negative control and positive control, respectively. for each independent experiment, the assay was performed three times. activity is expressed relative to that of ifn-␣6 and corrected for the quantification of the amount of ifn measured in the supernatants.the genbank accession numbers for amifn-␣ nucleotide sequences are as follows:the genes encoding amifn-␣ subtypes were cloned by pcr from giant panda dna. the primers for amifn-␣ were designed based on the conserved regions of carnivora ifn-␣ genes. pcr products were cloned into a ta cloning vector and the cloned fragments were sequenced. dna sequence analyses indicated that there were 12 subtypes of amifn-␣ genes and one ifn-␣ pseudogene, termed amifn-␣1-amifn-␣12 and amifn-␣ pseudogene, respectively. the amifn-␣ pseudogene, had changes in nucleotides at 23 and 74 which leads to a stop codon at amino acid position 24.comparison of the amfn-␣ subtype sequences demonstrated that homologies of nucleotides and amino acids approximate were 94-99 and 90-99%, respectively ( fig. 1 and table 1 ). all deduced amifn-␣ sequences contained an n-terminal secretory signal sequence from residue 1-23 and a putative n-glycosylation site at position 102-104. the predicted length of the mature polypeptides contained either 165 (amifn-␣1-amifn-␣11) or 166 (amifn-␣12) amino acid residues. amifn-␣12 contained one more amino acid residue at position 54 (lys). the predicted molecular mass of the protein with signal peptide was 20 kda. each of the deduced mature sequences contained six cysteine residues. the cysteine residues at positions 1, 29, 99 and 137 were very similar to the highly conserved cysteines in other mammalian ifn-␣ proteins at positions 1, 29, 99, and 139 (roberts et al., 1997) , suggesting a common tertiary structure. five proline residues were conserved among all of the giant panda ifn-␣ sequences at the positions of 4, 25, 39, 111, and 142, which correspond to the conserved positions of 4, 26, 39, 110, and 139 in other mammalian ifn-␣ protein (roberts et al., 1997) .comparison of the amifn-␣ gene sequences to feline ifn-␣ sequences demonstrated homologies of approximately 72%, respectively. comparison of the amino acid sequences of all giant panda subtypes with huifn-␣2 (j00207) and huifn-␣1 (m11003) showed approximate homologies of 56-59 and 58-60%, respectively (fig. 2) . homologies of the dog ifn-␣6 (np 001007129) and mouse ifn-␣7 (np 032360) amino acid sequences compared with the giant panda subtypes were approximately 67-71 and 49-53%, respectively.to better determine the evolutionary position of amifn-␣, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. all amifn-␣ genes clustered in the same group (fig. 3) . amifn-␣ clustered with interferon from other mammalian, such as cat and dog interferon, originating an in-group with respect to other mammalian species.the coding sequence of each amifn-␣ was sub-cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pcdna3.1 (+), the recombinant plasmids and pcdna3.1 vector were used to transfect into hek293 cells. supernatants obtained from amifn-␣ transiently transfected 293 cells were concentrated 10-fold using acetone. recombinant protein was visualized on sds-page by silver staining. western blotting analysis of the supernatants using monoclonal antibody against huifn-␣ indicated that all 12 subtypes of amifn-␣ genes were expressed and secreted (fig. 4) .the relative amounts of the different ifn subtypes in the supernatants were quantified by phosphorimager after sds-page. the antiviral activities of these supernatants were determined against vsv. the measured antiviral activities were then corrected for the amount of ifn to calculate the relative antiviral activities of the various ifn subtypes. no measurable activity could be detected in the supernatants from cells transfected with the vector alone. all ifn-␣ subtypes displayed antiviral activities, but different ones had various antiviral activities (fig. 5) . for example, amifn-␣3, amifn-␣4 and amifn-␣8 showed the highest antiviral potencies, four-fold activity levels compared to amifn-␣6, whereas amifn-␣2, amifn-␣5, amifn-␣7 and amifn-␣11 displayed lower activity than amifn-␣6.we tested the stability of 12 subtypes of amifn-␣ at ph 2 and 65 • c, respectively. therefore, the supernatants containing ifn-␣ were treated at ph 2 or 65 • c, and then used in the antiviral assay in parallel with untreated supernatants. the results showed that all amifn-␣ were stable at ph 2 for 24 h or 65 • c for 1 h because no loss in antiviral activity was detected in treated and untreated samples (data not shown).to determine whether some of the amifn-␣ subtypes evolved to acquire distinct biological functions, the relative antiproliferative activities of the different amifn-␣ subtypes were also determined by assaying the growth inhibition of b16 murine melanoma cells and k562 cells. results presented in figs. 6 and 7 show the antiproliferative potencies of the different subtypes.to b16 murine melanoma cells (fig. 6) , amifn-␣3, amifn-␣4 and amifn-␣8 showed the highest antiproliferative potencies, 32-fold activity higher than amifn-␣6, whereas amifn-␣5, amifn-␣7 and amifn-␣10 showed 16-fold activity higher than amifn-␣6. amifn-␣9 and amifn-␣11 displayed the same activity as amifn-␣6.to k562 cells (fig. 7) , amifn-␣3, amifn-␣7 and amifn-␣10 showed the highest antiproliferative potencies, 32-fold activity higher than amifn-␣6, whereas amifn-␣4, amifn-␣5 and amifn-␣8 showed 16-fold activity higher than amifn-␣6. amifn-␣11 displayed the same activity as amifn-␣6.in this report, we describe the cloning of genes encoding 12 giant panda type i ifn proteins. to confirm that sequences existed in the giant panda were not generated during either the pcr amplification or sequencing process, or both, two independent pcrs and sequencing were conducted. these clones were sequenced bidirectionally at least twice, and the consistent results from more than two positive clones were regarded as one subtype.all amifn-␣ genes are intronless. similar to other mammalian type i ifn subtypes (wonderling et al., 2002; nagai et al., 2004; nakamura et al., 1992) , the differences among 12 giant panda ifn-␣ protein sequences are based on a small number of amino acid changes. the differences observed among the amifn-␣ products are the length of the proteins, which has been reported for other species, such as the mouse, pig, and horse, but not for human ifn-␣, which has the same size in different subtypes. this size variation, where described, has been related to deletions or insertions in the nucleotide sequence.multiple ifn-␣ genes have been detected in many species (velan et al., 1985; harrison et al., 2004; henco et al., 1985; goeddel et al., 1981; chaplin et al., 1996) . it was found that giant panda ifn-␣ has 12 subtypes. the woodchuck ifn-␣ proteins are encoded by a multigenic family composed of at least 10 subtypes (berraondo et al., 2002) . the reason for this redundancy remains unknown. type i ifns compete for common binding sites on human cells (meager, 1998) and are believed to share a common receptor (kunzi and rowe, 2001) . however, it seems that the different ifn-␣ subtypes, although sharing some activities, have different functional profiles. within the ifn-␣ subfamily, genes are clustered by species, suggesting the possibility that ifn-␣ genes have been duplicated independently. in the case of ifn-␣, there is evidence that the ifn subfamily may have diversified adaptively in mammals. existence of so many ifn-␣ subtypes raises the question regarding whether there are biological differences among these proteins. although ifn-␣ subtype proteins from the same species are extremely homologous, differences in biological potency are often observed (ortaldo et al., 1984; mouchel-vielh et al., 1992; foster et al., 1996; yeow et al., 1998; baldwin et al., 2004) . different subtypes of huifn-␣ reveal various antiviral activities. huifn-␣8 was reportedly the most potent while huifn-␣1 provided the least amount of antiviral activity (foster et al., 1996) . fig. 7 . relative antiproliferative activity of amifn-␣ subtypes to k562 cells. the activities were normalized to the activity calculated for amifn-␣6 (that is set as 1 to represent the reciprocal of the dilution leading to 50% inhibition of cell proliferation) in the same experiment. the relative antiviral activity of each amifn-␣ subtype was the mean value of three replicates. standard deviation was the statistics value of three replicates. a1: pamifn-␣1; a2: pamifn-␣2; a3: pamifn-␣3; a4: pamifn-␣4; a5: pamifn-␣5; a6: pamifn-␣6; a7: pamifn-␣7; a8: pamifn-␣8; a9: pamifn-␣9; a10: pamifn-␣10; a11: pamifn-␣11; a12: pamifn-␣12; pcd: pcdna3.1 (+) vector; hua: human ifn-␣2b.several authors have reported that muifn-␣4 was 5-10 times more active than muifn-␣1 (van heuvel et al., 1986 , 1988 .to compare the properties of the different amifn-␣ subtypes, the recombinant plasmids expressing the various ifn-␣ subtypes were transiently transfected in 293 cells in parallel with the vector pcdna3.1. supernatants from transfected 293 cells were collected and analyzed. we demonstrated antiviral and antiproliferative activities of all amifn-␣ subtypes, and observed that different subtypes had different activities. as reported for human ifn-␣ subtypes, the differences in activities might be concerned with differences in receptor binding affinities (aguet et al., 1984; meister et al., 1986; piehler and schreiber, 1999; yamaoka et al., 1999) . maybe subtle modification in the protein structure accounts for the variation in biological activities. as the activity of mouse ifn-␣ (van pesch et al., 2004) , our results showed a good correlation between the antiviral and antiproliferative potencies of the ifn subtypes.in conclusion, this is the first report of the cloning and characterization of the giant panda ifn-␣ family with facilitates the way for systematic studies of the biological and therapeutic effects of this cytokine. amifn-␣ is likely to be efficient against both chronic viral infections and neoplastic diseases that affect the giant panda population. it will be significant importance for further studies to protect this endangered species.respiratory tract infections consist one of the major health problem of society, because they lead to high rates of hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality. essential feature of respiratory viruses is their easiness of transmission, especially in places with great density of people (schools, governments, mall centers, and means of public transport) (brydak 2007) . elder people, children up to 24 months and persons from high risk groups are particularly exposed to respiratory viruses' infections. the most frequently circulating respiratory viruses are: influenza virus type a and b, respiratory syncytial virus a (rsv-a) and b (rsv-b), parainfluenza viruses 1-3 (piv-1,-2,-3), human coronavirus (hcov), adenovirus (adv), human rhinovirus (hrv), and human metapneumovirus (hmpv). infections caused by respiratory viruses can have different clinical symptoms, while specific set of symptoms can be induced by different viruses. despite usually mild course of disease, some viruses causing certain disease entity can result in serious complications. furthermore, not only viruses can cause particular illness, but also bacteria. therefore, quick and appropriate diagnostic is crucial for administering proper treatment (stefańska et al. 2013) . what is more, organism attacked by one pathogen has reduced immunity and becomes vulnerable to the subsequent ones. in this way numerous co-infections occur, which can result in death (brydak 2008 (brydak , 2011 because rna virus samples were typed in voivodeship sanitary epidemiological stations, only subtyping of influenza viruses was achieved. the detection of subtypes was performed by rt-pcr. one-step rt-pcr analysis was performed using roche light cycler 2.0 system. rt-pcr reactions were performed in capillary tubes in 20 μl volumes with 0.5 μm primers and 0.2 μm probe for each reaction. according to who recommendations. the primers grswh1-349fw, grswh1-601rv, grsw-n1-975fw, grswn1-1084rv, h3h-319fw, h3h-377rv, n2h-1150bfw, n2h-1344rv, and probes grswh1-538, grswn1-10465b, h3h-358, n2h1290 were used (who 2014). the reaction mixture, containing reaction buffer, mgso 4 buffer, bsa, rnase-free h 2 o, and super-script® iii/platinum® taq mix, was incubated with 5 μl rna sample per capillary tube. rna from vaccine viruses a/california/7/2009(h1n1) pdm09 and a/victoria/361/2011(h3n2) were introduced as the positive control sample and rnase-free h 2 o was utilized as the negative control sample. before dna amplification cycles were begun, the rna templates were reverse transcribed to produce the corresponding cdna templates during reverse transcription procedure: 45 c for 15 min. dna templates were then subjected to an initialization step (1 cycle at 95 c for 3 min), followed by 50 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 c for 10 s, annealing at 55 c for 10 s and elongation at 72 c for 20 s.conventional multiplex rt-pcr analysis of positive specimens categorized into 7 age groups indicated, that most of morbidity to influenza was noted in age groups: 26-44 (22.9 %) and 45-64 years of age (21.6 %), whereas the influenza was the rarest in the age group 10-14 years of age (5.3 %) ( table 2 ). if it goes about influenza laboratory confirmed cases in high risk groups, 14.7 % of specimens were positive in >65 years age group and 17.6 % in 0-4 years age group. in all seven age groups, a co-domination between two subtypes of influenza virus type a was present, i.e. a/h1n1/pdm09 and a/h3n2/. considering infections caused by influenza-like viruses, the biggest amount of positive cases was registered in the age group 0-4 years of age (92.7 %), with the highest ratio of rs virus (87.9 %) and piv-3 (10.5 %). the lowest rate of infections caused by influenza-like viruses was observed in age groups: >65 (0.3 %) and 10-14 years of age (0.3 %).verification of results received by vsess demonstrated complete consistency with the results obtained nic (table 3 ). in nic, infections caused by influenza viruses comprised 50 % of laboratory confirmed cases and the other 50 % were those caused by influenza-like viruses. in the event of influenza viruses, the predominant subtype was a/h3n2/ (50 %), while a/h1n1/pdm09 made up 18.8 % of confirmations.taking into consideration only influenza-like viruses, it was noted that rsv (31.3 %) and rhinovirus (37.5 %) were dominating in this group. moreover, eight co-infections were registered in the framework of conducted research. five of them were between influenza virus and influenza-like viruses (a + adv, 2 a + rsv + hrv, a/h3n2/ + rsv b, a/h3n2/ + hcov), whereas three co-infections were detected only among influenza-like viruses (rsv a + hrv, rsv b + piv-3, adv + piv-1-3 + hcov). all co-infections detected in epidemic season 2013/2014 in poland are presented in table 4 . in the epidemic season 2013/2014 in poland, 2,497 specimens were tested, 23.0 % of which consisted positive specimens, which was, for comparison, about one third of the 6,949 tests performed in the preceding season. in order to get detailed virological analysis, laboratory data were categorized into 7 age groups: 0 -4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-25, 26-54, 45-64 , and >65 years old. influenza viruses made up 42.6 %, while influenza-like viruses 57.4 % of all positively confirmed cases. non-subtyped influenza virus type a was present in 39.3 % specimens and quite close percentages concerned subtypes a/h3n2/ -31.0 % and a/h1n1/pdm09 -29.8 %. in the season, three types of co-infections were registered: co-infections within influenza viruses, influenza viruses with influenza-like viruses, and co-infections within influenza-like viruses. detailed information is presented in table 1 . co-infection combinations encountered, especially the one combining five influenza-like viruses, were rather unprecedented and registered for the first time in poland. in every epidemic season, infections caused by influenza virus and influenza-like viruses are registered. in the epidemic season 2013/2014, the highest number of influenza confirmations was registered in the age group 26-44 years old (22.8 %), followed by 45-64 years old (21.6 %), and the lowest percentage was in 10-14 years old (5.3 %). in case of children aged 0-4 years old, an alarming issue is that the percentage of vaccinated children has been remaining at a very low level, namely 0.6-0.9 %, throughout many epidemic seasons. despite seasonal recommendations of advisory committee on immunization practices and many other international scientific societies, the percentage of vaccinated children in poland remains disappointingly low (epimeld 2014; epperson et al. 2014; grohskopf et al. 2014) .judging by the epidemiological and virological indicators, the epidemic season 2013/14 was mild and only low virus activity was reported in poland as well as in most european countries. the occurrence of influenza has been delayed in europe in the epidemic season 2013/2014, with a different timing across european countries. in the first four affected countries (bulgaria, greece, portugal, and spain), a/h1n1/pdm09 virus dominated. the peak of incidence to influenza and influenzalike infections in europe occurred in the third week of 2014 (13-19. 01. 2014), whereas in poland it was in the eleventh week of 2014 (10-16. 03. 2014) (fig. 1) . at the beginning of according to the niph-nih information, 9,000 hospitalizations and 17 deaths were registered in poland in 2013/2014. however, data regarding deaths are definitely underestimated, because only 3.8 % of population was vaccinated against influenza. in europe, 430 deaths of influenza were noted with the highest number in spain (ecdc 2014).coronaviruses (order nidovirales, family coronaviridae) are large enveloped, positive-stranded rna viruses that infect a variety of animal and bird species, including humans. they are usually associated with enteric or respiratory infections and until recently they were divided into three groups, based on genetic and antigenic similarities (enjuanes et al., 2000; lai and holmes, 2001) . canine coronavirus (ccov), former member of group 1, is currently classified as a variant of the species alphacoronavirus 1, genus alphacoronavirus, along with the feline coronavirus (fcov) and the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev), according to the international committee of taxonomy of viruses (carstens, 2010) .to date, two different genotypes of ccov are known, ccov type i (ccov-i) and ccov type ii (ccov-ii). typical reference strains of ccov are classified as ccov-ii buonavoglia, 2008, 2011) . ccov-i strains were identified in the beginning of the 2000s, when pratelli and coworkers highlighted that fcov-like ccov strains, that share high homology with fcovs, are circulating in canine population (pratelli et al., 2001a (pratelli et al., , 2002 . recently, ccov-ii genotype was divided in two subtypes, ccov-iia (classical strains) and ccov-iib (tgev-like strains), with ccov-iib emerging as a result of a putative recombination between ccov-ii and tgev (decaro et al., 2009 (decaro et al., , 2010 .the genome of ccov consists of 4 orfs, encoding spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m) and nucleocapsid (n) structural proteins and several orfs translated into non structural proteins (polyprotein-precursor of rna-dependent rna polymerase, 3a, 3b, 3c, 7a and 7b) (lai and holmes, 2001) . s, e and m proteins are present in the viral envelope. glycoprotein s forms club-shaped projections on the surface of the virus and it is responsible for binding to host cell membranes, membrane fusion and induction of neutralizing antibodies (enjuanes et al., 2000) .ccov was described for the first time in 1974, being associated with reports of diarrhea in dogs (binn et al., 1974) . it is considered to be an etiologic agent of gastroenteritis in dogs, usually manifested with anorexia, dullness, diarrhea and vomiting, lasting for up to 2 weeks. feces are usually loose to watery and they may contain mucus or blood. younger dogs are more severely affected. mild disease or asymptomatic carriage are probably in many cases common outcomes of infection. clinical signs are usually mild and the disease is highly contagious with low mortality rate (appel et al., 1979; carmichael and binn, 1981) .ccov is known to have spread worldwide, with the virus detected or isolated in europe, u.s.a., asia and australia (appel, 1987; bandai et al., 1999; carmichael and binn, 1981; naylor et al., 2001; pollock and carmichael, 1979) . in greece, ccov detection was reported for the first time in 2010, and it was associated with a severe outbreak of enteritis in young dogs in a municipal kennel (ntafis et al., 2010) . the aim of the present study was the detection, molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of ccov strains circulating in greece.between december 2007 and december 2009, 206 fecal samples were collected from dogs with diarrhea (from mild to severe), from northern, central and southern greece. in detail, 103, 44, 56 and 3 samples came from the administrative division of the central macedonia region, the thessaly region, the attica region and the crete region, respectively. dogs were housed in kennels or pet shops or were presented at veterinary practices at the time of the sampling. signalment (including age, sex, breed, singly housed/housed in groups and vaccination history) was recorded.rectal swabs were placed in isothermal boxes using ice bags and transferred in the lab. samples were kept frozen at à80°c until tested.fecal samples were homogenized in phosphate buffered saline solution (pbs, sigma-aldrich, usa) and were clarified by centrifugation at 8000g for 5 min. total rna was extracted from the supernatant fluid with a commercial rna extraction kit (qiaamp viral rna mini kit, qiagen gmbh, germany).for the ccov rna detection and quantitation, both a reverse transcription nested pcr (rt-npcr) and a real time rt-pcr assay were used, as previously described pratelli et al., 1999) .for ccov type i and ii detection and quantitation, two rt-pcr assays (amplifying a part of the s gene) and two real time rt-pcr assays (amplifying a part of the m gene) were used (decaro et al., 2005) .for ccov subtyping and discrimination of ccov-iia and ccov-iib strains, two rt-pcr assays with comparable levels of sensitivity were performed, as previously described (decaro et al., 2010) . a rt-pcr, able to discriminate ccov and tgev, was used in order to verify the absence of tgev strains in the ccov-iib positive samples (wesley, 1999) .to determine strains' sequence of each genotype/subtype, positive samples from all regions of sampling were chosen randomly. at least 10% of each category was subjected to sequencing.to determine the sequence of ccov-i strains, a 1-kb region of the 5' end of the s gene was amplified from 15 samples, using superscript one-step rt-pcr for long templates (invitrogen s.r.l.) and primers polend (5 0 -ctaaggaagggtaagttgctca-3 0 ) and 1060dr (5 0 -atcagcagatgcttgrggaca-3 0 ). the cdna was synthesized at 50°c for 30 min with denaturation at 94°c for 2 min. the amplification reaction was carried out for 40 cycles with denaturation at 94°c for 1 min, annealing at 52°c for 2 min and polymerization at 68°c for 2 min.to determine the sequence of the 5' end of the s gene of 19 ccov-iia strains, a rt-pcr assay with el-ins1 (5 0 -ggattactaar-gadkggtaagttgc-3 0 ) and s2 (5 0 -caacttcacttgaagcaaca-3 0 ) primers was used, as previously described (decaro et al., 2007) .to determine the sequence of the 5' end of the s gene of 13 ccov-iib strains, a rt-pcr assay with 20179 (5 0 -ggctctatc acataactcagtcctag-3 0 ) and 174-268 (5 0 -caacatgtaacctt tgtctgtgatctgc-3 0 ) primers was used, as previously described (decaro et al., 2010) .the nucleotide sequences were determined in both directions by a commercial facility (beckman colter genomics, united kingdom). sequence assembling and analysis were carried out using the bioedit software package (hall, 1999) and the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) analysis tool. phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the mega4 program (tamura et al., 2007) . phylogenetic trees, based on the partial amino acid sequences of s and m proteins, were elaborated using neighbour-joining method, supplying a statistical support with bootstrapping over 1000 replicates.the partial sequences of the s gene of ccov-i strains la/10/08/i/ gr, th/95/08/i/gr, th/24/09/i/gr, th/69/09/i/gr, at/02/09/i/gr, la/12/08/i/gr, th/101/08/i/gr, vo/34/09/i/gr, at/05/09/i/gr, th/10/09/i/gr, th/25/08/i/gr, th/24/08/i/gr,

to be statistically significant. statistical analysis was performed using statistical package statgraphics plus for windows version 4.0, manugistics inc., rockville, md, usa.by means of rt-npcr and/or real time rt-pcr, 134 of 206 (65.1%) samples were positive for ccov (table 1) . ccov was detected in all regions of sampling. by means of genotype specific rt-pcr and/or real time rt-pcr, ccov-i and ccov-ii were detected in 99 and 94 of 134 ccov positive samples, respectively (tables 2  and 3) .by rt-pcr subtyping, ccov-iia and ccov-iib were detected in 72 and 11 of the 94 ccov-ii positive samples, respectively, while in 10 samples, both subtypes were detected. one of the samples (85/08) was not characterized while no tgev strains were detected.ccov-i and ccov-ii were detected in 40 (29.9%) and 30 (22.4%) of the 134 positive samples, respectively, while in 63/134 (47%) samples more than one ccov genotype/subtype was detected, including 3 samples where triple infections were detected (ccov-i/ccov-iia/ccov-iib). the frequency of ccov genotypes and subtypes detection is shown in table 4 and the frequency of genotype/subtype combinations in mixed infections is shown in fig. 1 . characterization of one sample was not possible (85/08), since by s-gene rt-pcr and m-gene real time rt-pcr, it was characterized as ccov-ii and ccov-i, respectively.ccov was detected in 99 (77.3%) of 128 dogs, housed in groups (kennels, animal shelters, pet shops) and in 35 (44.9%) of 78 singly housed animals, the difference being statistically significant (p < 0.05).in addition, regarding ccov frequency in different age groups, the virus was detected in 67 (73.6%) of 91 dogs younger than 3 months old, and in 67 (58.3%) of 115 dogs at least 3 months of age, the difference between the groups being statistically significant (p < 0.05). the oldest animal tested positive for ccov was 12 years old.sequence analysis of the 15 ccov-i greek strains in the 5' end of the s gene showed a 64.1-99.8% nucleotide (nt) and 60.6-99.6% amino acid (aa) identity to each other. the greek strains shared the highest genetic relatedness with either one of the two ccov type i reference strains, elmo/02 (ay307020) and 23/03 (ay307021). according to the phylogenetic analysis result, the ccov-i strains segregate with either elmo/02 (2 strains, 84.9-87.2% nt identity) or 23/03 (74.1-92.8% nt identity), forming two unique clades of ccov-i viruses. the strains at/02/09/i/gr and at/05/09/i/gr, detected in a pet shop outbreak, shared 63% nt identity to each other. all ccov-i strains formed a separate clade within the same cluster of ccov-i and fcov-i viruses, which is separate from that of ccov-iia and fcov-ii (fig. 2) .sequence analysis of the 19 ccov-iia greek strains in the 5' end of the s gene showed a 79.8-100% nt and 77.7-100% aa identity to each other. by excluding the strain ed/99/08/iia/gr, the nt and aa identities among greek ccov-iia viruses reached 99.7-100%. by blast, it was revealed that ed/99/08/iia/gr shared the highest identity with the ccov-iia reference strain bgf10 (ay342160) (83.7%), while the rest of the strains showed the highest identity to ccov-iia reference strain cb/05(dq112226). the inferred amino table 1 detection of ccov rna in feces by rt-npcr and by real time rt-pcr assays. the numbers indicate the positive (+) or

acid sequence of ed/99/08/iia/gr was compared to the analogous sequences available in the online databases. sequence analysis revealed a highly divergent n-terminal domain of the s protein, 6 amino acids longer with regards to the reference strains, with the insertions being unique to ed/99/08/iia/gr. the unique residues were found in positions 69-70 (n, i), 147-148 (p, s), and 387-390 (t, l, i, e) of the s protein (fig. 3) . according to the phylogenetic analysis result, the ccov-iia strains segregated with cb/05, with the exception of ed/99/08/iia/gr, that formed a unique clade, within the cluster of ccov-iia and fcov-ii (fig. 4) .sequence analysis of the 13 ccov-iib greek strains in the 5' end of the s gene showed a 94.1-100% nt identity and 92.3-100% aa identity to each other. the strains shared the highest genetic relatedness with either one of the two ccov-iib reference strains, 119/ 08 (eu924791) and 198/07 (gq130266). phylogenetic analysis revealed that the greek strains were more closely related to ccov-iib strains detected in italy, romania and hungary, forming a separate clade from the uk ccov-iib strains. in addition, tgev strains and ucd-1 ''old'' ccov-iib strain formed a separate clade within the same cluster of tgev and tgev-like viruses (fig. 5) . canine coronavirus is one of the major pathogenic agents of gastroenteritis and diarrhea in dogs. the main purpose of the study was to identify the frequency of ccov infections in dogs with diarrhea and to characterize the strains that circulate in greece. by means of molecular techniques, ccov was detected in 65.1% of the dogs presenting diarrhea. the frequency of ccov detection was higher than the frequency reported in other countries including italy, turkey, england, japan and portugal (bandai et al., 1999; decaro et al., 2010; yesilbag et al., 2004) , highlighting the significance of the pathogen as a contributing agent to the manifestation of diarrhea in dogs. in addition, positive samples were identified in all regions sampled, suggesting that the virus is frequently detected and it circulates among canine population in greece.according to the results of the present study, ccov was more frequently detected in dogs housed in groups than in singly housed animals. one possible explanation of the difference is the close contact of the animals, the fecal-oral transmission of the disease and the long-term viral shedding. as it has been suggested, dogs may be contagious for a period varying from 2 weeks to several months (keenan et al., 1976; pratelli et al., 2001a,b) , highly contaminating their environment. likewise, similar differences between singly and group housed dogs have been identified in previous studies, by means of serological assays (naylor et al., 2001; rimmelzwaan et al., 1991) .dogs of all breeds and ages appear to be susceptible to ccov infection (appel, 1987; carmichael and binn, 1981) . in the present study, ccov was more frequently detected in dogs younger than 3 months old than in dogs of at least 3 months of age. puppies usually become susceptible after the decline of the maternally derived antibodies, which last for a period of 4-5 weeks (appel, 1987) . in contrast, older animals appear to be less susceptible, due to acquired immunity, occurring as a result of prior exposure to the pathogen. in the present study, the oldest animal tested positive was a 12 year old dog. the results indicate that ccov is more wide-spread in puppies, though older animals can also be presented with a coronaviral infection.concerning the detection and characterization of ccov, both rt-pcr and real time rt-pcr were used. it was shown, that there were strains either detected (4/206) or characterized (8/134 ccov-i, 7/134 ccov-ii) only by real time rt-pcr, as it was expected, since these assays have higher sensitivity compared to the rt-pcr assays (decaro et al., , 2005 . however, in the present study some of the strains were either detected (2/206) or characterized (2/134 ccov-i, 7/134 ccov-ii) only by rt-pcr assays, which may be explained by the fact that the assays amplify different parts of the genome. since coronavirus mutation rates are considered to be high due to the infidelity of rna-dependent rna polymerase (woo et al., 2009) , false-negative results are expected, when either primers or probes lack the ability to anneal. it is obvious that the results may be more reliable by using both assays, since no assay has been demonstrated to represent the gold standard for the identification and characterization of ccov.regarding genotype/subtype identification, it was shown that ccov-i was more frequently detected than ''classical'' ccov-iia or ccov-iib viruses. however, in most of the positive samples (47.01%) more than one strain was detected. in addition, in the present study triple ccov infections (ccov-i/iia/iib), representing almost 5% of the mixed infections, were detected for the first time, since so far only double infections have been identified in all possible combinations (decaro et al., 2009 (decaro et al., , 2010 erles and brownlie, 2009) . mixed ccov infections are usual, although their significance is not completely understood . preliminary studies have indicated that they may be related to more severe symptoms (decaro et al., 2005) , but the inability to cultivate ccov-i so far, impedes the elucidation of its pathogenesis and its role in mixed infections.in the present study, the 5' end of the s gene was chosen for sequence and phylogenetic analysis of ccov strains, since mutations that are related to antigenicity, virulence and viral tropism are often observed in this region (lai and holmes, 2001; sanchez et al., fig. 3 . n-terminus of the s protein of the ed/99/08/iia/gr strain with ccov-iia reference strains bgf10, 1-71, insavc-1 and k378. the amino acid insertions of ed/99/08/iia/ gr are enclosed in rectangles. 1999). regarding ccov-i, the greek strains showed low genetic similarity to each other and to the prototype ccov-i strains. most of the ccov-i greek strains shared the highest similarity with 23/ 03 prototype strain, while only two with elmo/02, revealing that 23/03-like strains are more frequently detected in greece. in addition, the two different ccov-i strains detected in the same pet shop outbreak (at/02/09/i/gr and at/05/09/i/gr) indicate that different strains of the same genotype/subtype can be involved in an outbreak.regarding ccov-iia, the greek strains showed high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototype cb/05, with the exception of one strain (ed/99/08/iia/gr). ccov-iia strains shared much higher identity to each other and to the prototype strains than ccov-i strains. recently, it was suggested that ccov-i represents a possible parental biotype of ccov-iia (lorusso et al., 2008) . if this is the case, the genome of ccov-iia is being subjected to the evolutionary pressure of the host immune system for a shorter period of time, with respect to the ccov-i genome. this fact makes tempting to assume that the higher homogeneity of the ccov-iia strains' genome may be attributed to the shorter circulation time, with respect to strains of type i. sequence analysis of more ccov-i strains, coming from different geographic regions may help acquire more information regarding their variability, since so far only few ccov-i strains have been analyzed.of significant interest is the ed/99/08/iia/gr strain that appears to be divergent, indicating the plasticity of the 5 0 -end of the ccov s gene. the receptor-binding domain of coronaviruses is localized within the n-terminus of the s protein and it has been shown that amino acid changes in the region are associated with changes in the tropism and virulence of the virus (lai and holmes, 2001; sanchez et al., 1999) . similar divergent strains have been identified in the past in australia and in the united kingdom and they have been associated with severe gastroenteritis outbreaks (naylor et al., 2002; sanchez-morgado et al., 2004) . isolation and experimental infection could give information regarding ed/99/08/iia/ gr mutations and their possible relation to viral pathogenicity.regarding ccov-iib, it was shown that the newly emerged strains circulate in greece with higher frequency than previously reported (decaro et al., 2010) . sequence and phylogenetic analysis of ccov-iib strains revealed for the first time that the greek viruses belong to the newly emerged tgev-like strains and not to the ''old'' ucd1 tgev-like strain. in addition, the greek strains shared high similarity to each other and were genetically related to strains from hungary and romania and distant from uk strains. the relation among strains could be explained based on the trends in commercial trade practices, since greece, as italy (decaro et al., 2010) imports dogs mainly from countries of eastern europe.from the results of this study, it can be concluded that ccov infection is widespread in greece, especially in young puppies and dogs housed in groups, presenting with diarrhea. mixed infections prevail among ccov infections, with the triple (ccov-i/iia/ iib) infections being reported for the first time. sequence analysis of different strains revealed high variability among ccov-i strains at the 5' end of the s gene. in addition, the identification of a divergent strain is reported. the circulation of ccov-i highly variable and tgev-like emerging strains, as well as the detection of divergent strains, raise significant concerns over the spread of the strains in dogs. to date, vaccination against ccov is considered a controversial issue, depending heavily upon the population at risk. further research on the pathogenicity could inform on the possible need for wider cross-reactive prophylactic vaccines.r espiratory tract infections are a significant contributor to the global burden of respiratory tract illnesses, with up to 4 million deaths worldwide in 2013 (1) . several pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, can cause respiratory tract infections. as clinical presentations often overlap, identification of the underlying pathogen based solely on clinical criteria is challenging (2) . even though most respiratory tract infections are self-limited in immunocompetent hosts, many are treated, as shown in a recent study highlighting the increase in unnecessary antibiotic use in this group (3) . in other patient groups, including immunocompromised patients, elderly patients, and critically ill patients, complications from respiratory tract infections often occur, with poor outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality (4) (5) (6) . thus, the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose respiratory tract infections is critical for optimal patient care. additionally, rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for the timely administration of antiviral therapy, when available, and the institution of contact and droplet precautions to prevent health care-associated transmission (7, 8) . several instruments and multiplexed molecular panels are currently approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in nasopharyngeal swab (nps) specimens. these methods differ based on several criteria, including the degree of multiplexing (4 to 22 targets), complexity of the method (moderate to high), throughput (low to high), and turnaround time (tat) (ϳ1 h to 8 h) (9) . in general, performance characteristics of these multiplex panels are significantly better than those of conventional methods, including viral culture and antigen tests, and have replaced these methods in many laboratories. on the other hand, the increased cost of multiplexed molecular panels compared to the cost of conventional methods has raised questions on their cost/benefit ratio, particularly as many viral targets on these panels have no specific treatments. however, given their utility in the rapid diagnosis of infections (especially in immunocompromised patients), infection control and prevention practices, and antibiotic stewardship, the interest in multiplexed pcrs remains high.the genmark respiratory pathogen (rp) panel is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test that recently received u.s. fda clearance for use on genmark's new eplex instrument. the eplex rp panel detects 21 of the most common respiratory pathogens in nps specimens. viral targets identified are adenovirus, coronavirus (229e, hku1, nl63, and oc43), human metapneumovirus (hmpv), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (hrv/ev), influenza a virus, influenza a h1 virus, influenza a 2009 h1 virus, influenza a h3 virus, influenza b virus, parainfluenza virus 1 (piv1), piv2, piv3, piv4, respiratory syncytial virus subtype a (rsv-a), and rsv-b. bacterial targets identified are chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae (10) . the eplex rp panel is a sample-to-answer multiplex assay that runs on a single-use cartridge that automates all aspects of nucleic acid testing, including extraction, amplification, and detection. it combines electrowetting microfluidics and genmark's esensor technology, which is based on the principles of competitive dna hybridization and electrochemical detection, as previously described for the genmark xt-8 respiratory viral panel (11) .in this multicenter clinical trial study, the performance characteristics of the investigational-use-only (iuo) eplex rp panel were evaluated by using nps specimens collected at 13 sites across the united states and canada. reproducibility was evaluated at 3 sites. in addition to assay performance, other characteristics, including assay workflow and turnaround time, were evaluated.study population. the study population included patients of all ages and both genders presenting with signs and/or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection at 13 clinical sites located in the united states and canada. residual nps specimens were prospectively collected from march 2013 through august 2014 from 5 sites and frozen at ϫ80°c for future testing and were prospectively collected from september through october 2016 from 4 sites and tested fresh. to supplement the results of the prospective collection, nps samples positive for low-prevalence pathogens were retrospectively collected and frozen. frozen samples were thawed, pipetted into separate aliquots, and frozen at ϫ80°c until they were tested by eplex rp, the biofire rp, and/or target-specific pcr/bidirectional sequencing as needed. also, for low-prevalence pathogens, additional contrived samples were used to evaluate assay performance.overall study design. nps specimens were prospectively and retrospectively collected in viral transport medium, handled, and processed according to the nps kit manufacturer's instructions. either samples were collected specifically for this study, separately from a standard-of-care (soc) purpose, or the residual sample was deidentified and provided after soc was completed. the study was approved by a central quorum review institutional review board and/or individual clinical testing site institutional review board.samples were tested with the eplex rp panel at 1 of 5 sites and compared to results of testing with biofire filmarray respiratory panel version 1.7 (biomérieux, durham, nc) and an analytically validated pcr amplification assay(s) followed by bidirectional sequencing, if necessary (e.g., for resolution of discordant results or virus subtyping) (laboratory corporation of america, morrisville, nc).genmark eplex rp panel testing. testing with the eplex rp panel was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the materials in the kit. briefly, after vortexing, 200 l of the primary nps sample was aspirated into the sample delivery device (sdd) provided with the eplex rp panel kit and vortexed. the entire volume of the sdd was dispensed into the sample loading port of the eplex rp panel cartridge, and the cap was depressed to close the port. each cartridge was bar-coded and scanned with the eplex instrument and inserted into an available bay (fig. 1) . upon the completion of the assay run, the eplex instrument ejected the cartridge for disposal, and an eplex rp panel report was generated.comparator method and method for resolution of discordant results. the comparator method was biofire filmarray respiratory panel version 1.7. all collected samples were tested with the biofire rp, which detects all the respiratory viral and bacterial targets included on the eplex rp panel but does not differentiate between rsv subtypes a and b (12) . samples with rsv detected by the biofire rp were additionally tested with an analytically validated pcr amplification assay(s) followed by confirmation by bidirectional sequencing to determine the subtype (laboratory corporation of america, morrisville, nc).results from collected samples that were discordant between the eplex rp panel and the comparator method (i.e., false negative [fn] or false positive [fp]) were tested with an analytically validated pcr amplification assay(s) followed by bidirectional sequencing as described above. for coronaviruses, additional repeat testing by the biofire rp and eplex rp panel was also conducted as part of discordantresult resolution.reproducibility study. three reproducibility panels, each with 6 pathogens (influenza a h3 virus, rsv-a, piv1, hmpv, coronavirus oc43, and adenovirus species b) at 3 different concentrations (moderate [3ϫ the limit of detection {lod}]), low [1ϫ lod], and negative) in nps specimens, were tested at 3 sites. lod studies were performed by the manufacturer (data not shown). reproducibility testing was performed by 2 operators at each of 3 sites, and each operator tested the reproducibility panels in triplicate over 6 days (including 5 nonconsecutive days) by using 3 different cartridge lots, resulting in 2 days of testing for each of the 3 lots. statistical methods. positive percent agreement (ppa), negative percent agreement (npa), and overall percent agreement (opa) with the comparator method results or expected results were determined for each target detected by the eplex rp panel. the ppa was calculated as 100 ϫ no. of tp/(no. of tp ϩ no. of fn), the npa was calculated as 100 ϫ no. of tn/(no. of tn ϩ no. of fp), and opa was calculated as 100 ϫ (no. of tp ϩ no. of tn)/(no. of tp ϩ no. of tn ϩ no. of fp ϩ no. of fn), where tp is true-positive results, fn is false-negative results, tn is true-negative results, and fp is false-positive results. the two-sided 95% score confidence interval (ci) was calculated for ppa, npa, and opa. statistical analysis was performed by using sas version 9.4. workflow and turnaround time study. a time study was performed to determine the time needed to perform the eplex rp panel test. data were averaged from 20 samples tested by 2 operators. each step of the process from sample preparation to unloading of the instrument was recorded and timed, and an average tat was determined.patient demographics. a total of 2,462 prospectively collected, 446 retrospectively collected, and 327 contrived samples were eligible for testing with the eplex rp panel. approximately 67% of samples were collected with copan-manufactured utm (universal transport medium), and 33% were collected with remel m4 or m5 medium. demographic information for the evaluable prospectively and retrospectively collected subject samples is provided in table 1 . approximately 50% of the subjects were male, with median ages of 33 years for subjects with prospectively collected samples and 5 years for subjects with retrospectively collected samples. the prevalences of eplex rp panel targets by age group during the two phases of prospective collection are provided in tables s1 and s2 in the supplemental material.assay performance. (i) accuracy. of the 3,235 samples eligible for testing with the eplex rp panel, 154 had invalid results (4.8%). after repeat testing, 8 samples were not evaluable due to final, invalid results (7 prospective samples and 1 contrived sample). the final validity rate was 99.8% (95% ci, 99.5% to 99.9%). the eplex rp panel detected a potential respiratory pathogen in 1,212 of 2,462 prospectively collected nps specimens tested, for a positivity rate of 49%. the ppas and npas with 95% cis of the eplex rp panel targets with comparator methods are provided in tables 2 to 4 separately for retrospectively collected samples and prospectively collected samples and with all samples combined. additional data for fresh and frozen prospectively collected samples are presented in table s3 in the supplemental material.the overall percent agreement between the eplex rp and biofire rp results was ͼ95% for all targets tested. target but positive for either the 2009 h1 (n ϭ 5) or h3 (n ϭ 1) subtype, and 9 samples were positive for the influenza a virus target without a subtype being identified. of note, influenza a h1 virus was not detected, and very few chlamydia pneumoniae (n ϭ 4) isolates were detected during the study period. for these targets, at least 50 specimens with the pathogen spiked into negative nps specimens were contrived; all were detected by eplex rp (data not shown). discordance resolution results (table 5 ) demonstrate that while eplex rp had a high level of agreement with the biofire rp and detected the same targets in nearly all samples, each assay detected targets that the other did not. in table 5 , samples with targets that were detected by eplex rp but not detected by biofire rp (fp) are counted as true-positive samples if the target was detected by discordance testing (tpd). samples with targets not detected by eplex rp but detected by the biofire rp (fn) are counted as true-negative samples if the target was not detected by discordance testing (tnd). given the number of discordant samples between the two panels for coronavirus detection, additional repeat testing by both the biofire rp and eplex rp was performed as part of the discordance analysis. this additional testing demonstrated evidence of of the 2,462 prospectively collected samples, 164 had codetections by at least one of the assays (data not shown). the eplex rp panel identified a total of 135 prospective samples with multiple pathogens detected, or 5.5% of all prospectively collected samples, while the biofire rp detected a total of 116 samples with multiple pathogens, or 4.7% of all prospectively collected samples. of the 135 samples with multiple pathogens detected by eplex rp, 118 (4.8%) had two pathogens, 14 (0.6%) had three pathogens, and 3 (0.1%) had four pathogens detected. of the 135 samples with codetections, 57 samples (2.3%) included one or more pathogens that were not detected by the biofire rp method. the comparator method identified a total of 32 (1.3%) codetections with one or more pathogens not identified by the eplex rp panel. discordance resolution results are included in the analysis presented in table 5 .(ii) reproducibility. each of 3 sites performing the reproducibility study collected 35 to 36 results for each target at each concentration, for a total of 107 to 108 samples per site. for the moderately positive and the negative panels, the percent agreement was 100% (95% ci, 96.6% to 100%) for all 7 panel targets. for the low-positive panel, the percent agreement was 100% (95% ci, 96.5% to 100%) for 6 of the 7 panel targets. for the remaining adenovirus panel target, the percent agreement in the low-positive panel was 91.6% (95% ci, 84.8% to 95.5%). agreement results are shown in table 6 . a total of 315/324 (97.2%) samples yielded a valid result upon initial testing. upon repeat testing, all but one specimen yielded a valid result, for a final validity rate of 99.7% (95% ci: 98.3% to 99.9%). no significant sources of variability were found for any of the targets on the panel across cartridge lots, operation days, technologists/operators, or sites (data not shown).workflow and turnaround time study. the time to identification from receipt to result was determined to be 1 h 45 min and 57 s, with hands-on times (hots) per sample of 1 min and 35 s.in this multicenter clinical study, the performance characteristics of the new eplex respiratory pathogen panel on the genmark eplex instrument were estimated by measuring agreement with the results of the biofire rp, a commercially available multiplex respiratory panel. the eplex rp panel was recently fda cleared and expands the available options for laboratories interested in the rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract infections using broadly multiplexed molecular assay on nps specimens. similar to the biofire rp, eplex rp offers a large panel of both viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens in a simple, sample-to-answer format with minimal hands-on time and a rapid turnaround time to results.as with all molecular diagnostic test methods, both the biofire rp and eplex rp have the potential to generate false-positive and false-negative results, as confirmed in this study by additional testing with target-specific pcrs with bidirectional sequencing. the unavailability of an established gold standard prevents a true measure of correctness, requiring the use of agreement measures with a nonreference standard instead to establish the performance characteristics of a new test (13) . thus, data presented in this study reflect only the agreement between the results of the two platforms. in spite of these limitations, the overall performance of eplex rp was comparable to that of the biofire rp, with an overall percent agreement (true-positive and true-negative results) of ͼ95% for all available targets tested. in line with our results, a recent study by nijhuis and colleagues evaluating the performance of the eplex research-use-only (ruo) rp panel compared to laboratory-developed assays found an overall agreement of 97.4%, with discordant results occurring primarily for samples with low pathogen loads, as estimated by using cycle threshold (c t ) values (i.e., high c t value, ͼ35) (10).the highest numbers of discordant results were observed for adenovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus targets. this finding may be explained by the large diversity of genotypes present within each of these groups of pathogens or the prevalence of these pathogens in the population tested. for adenovirus, the performance of diagnostic tests is particularly important for young children and immuno- compromised hosts. however, the detection of adenovirus can be challenging. in this study, eplex rp detected more adenoviruses than did the biofire rp. a recent report on the performance of biofire rp v1.7 for the detection of adenovirus highlighted the decreased sensitivity of the assay for samples with low viral loads or those positive for species a, d, and f (14) . although the eplex rp panel detects 4 genotypes of coronaviruses (hku1, oc43, 229e, and nl63), results are reported without the genotyping information. there are currently no treatments for coronaviruses, and the utility of the genotyping information may lie in its value for epidemiological studies. reports of severe coronavirus infections have been reported for immunocompromised hosts, but there has not been any indication that severity is associated with a particular genotype (15) .similar to the biofire rp, eplex rp detects a wide range of rhinovirus and enteroviruses genotypes, but given their high degree of genetic similarity, it does not reliably differentiate between these two species. based on discordance analysis performed by pcr and bidirectional sequencing, most samples were positive for rhinovirus, a trend that is expected given that rhinoviruses are the most common cause of the common cold (16) .the overall agreement for influenza viruses was high. as the prospective collection periods for this clinical study occurred during the 2013 and 2016 respiratory seasons, there was an expected lack of clinical specimens positive for influenza a h1 virus (17) . most of the influenza virus infections during that time period were due to the 2009 h1 and h3 viruses. hence, the evaluation of the influenza virus a h1 target was performed entirely by using contrived nps samples. similar to the biofire rp results, instances of samples positive for influenza a virus without subtypes or positive for an influenza a virus subtype only were identified. such results may be caused by low virus titers or a novel influenza virus subtype and thus require additional testing.only a limited number of samples were positive for chlamydia pneumoniae, and the evaluation was conducted primarily with contrived samples. the performance for c. pneumoniae was similar to that reported in the biofire rp clinical study, which was also conducted by using primarily contrived samples (12) . both chlamydia pneumoniae and mycoplasma pneumoniae are associated with atypical, community-acquired pneumonia (cap), with no seasonality and nonspecific symptoms (18) . therefore, the inclusion of both bacteria in large multiplex panels has the potential to significantly improve the diagnosis of cap.a notable difference between the eplex rp panel and the biofire rp is the absence of bordetella pertussis-bordetella parapertussis targets among the bacterial targets. it is noteworthy that unlike other bacterial targets on the panel, infection with bordetella pertussis-b. parapertussis has a relatively specific epidemiology, with higher incidences typically being reported for children less than 2 months old and, more recently, for unvaccinated populations or vaccinated patients with waning immunity (19) . thus, exclusion from a highly multiplexed respiratory panel may be warranted. in addition, the utilization of the single-copy pertussis toxin promoter target (ptxp) in some multiplex panels has been shown to be less sensitive for the detection of b. pertussis than pcr tests targeted to the multicopy is481 insertion sequence (20) . as a result, when b. pertussis infection is suspected, an fda-cleared b. pertussis molecular test may be more appropriate.similar to other broadly multiplexed respiratory panels, the eplex rp panel allows the detection of coinfections. in this study, coinfections were identified in 5.5% of samples, with human rhinovirus/enterovirus being the most common virus detected in coinfected specimens. the importance of detecting coinfections was highlighted in a recent study showing that viral-bacterial coinfection during severe cap in adults resulted in a more complicated disease course and was associated with complications (21) . in other studies, human rhinoviruses were frequently detected in association with bacterial pathogens in a hematopoietic stem cell transplant population, suggesting that this commonly detected virus may be a significant cause of severe pneumonia in immunocompromised patients (22, 23) .the initial rate of invalid results with eplex rp was 4.8%, with repeat testing resulting in a final rate of invalid results of 0.2%. this value falls in the range of rates of invalid results reported for other multiplexed respiratory panels, including nanosphere verigene rv (9.7%), xtag rvp (1 to 2%), and the biofire rp (1 to 3%) (24) (25) (26) (27) .the eplex instrument consists of a stand-alone system, with no additional accessories (e.g., computer) and a touch screen, making it a great option for space-constrained laboratories. the eplex instrument is available in configurations ranging from one to four towers, with each tower containing six random-access testing bays. this supports single-shift (8 h) testing volumes ranging from 24 samples to 96 samples, with a tat of less than 2 h and an hot of less than 2 min, providing a flexible capacity for laboratories of all sizes. additional features available on the system include the ability to generate customized reports (e.g., statistical and trending reports) and the potential for a bidirectional interface with laboratory information systems.in conclusion, the eplex rp panel provides a rapid, sensitive, broadly multiplexed, sample-to-results option with minimal hands-on time. the assay performance was equivalent to that of the biofire filmarray rp for all targets. this new, fully integrated instrument is easily expandable and offers a great option for the implementation of a multiplex assay in larger-volume laboratories.supplemental material for this article may be found at https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm .01658-17.supplemental file 1, pdf file, 0.1 mb.the most characteristic symptom of influenza is a sudden onset of fever (!38 c), sore throat, muscle pain, cough, and general weakness (brydak 2008) . the diagnosis is particularly difficult among children in whom verbal communication is not yet developed (wrotek et al. 2018) . the most effective way to prevent the infections among children is seasonal flu vaccination administered every season (committee on infectious diseases 2017). according to the advisory committee on immunization practices in the usa, a trivalent vaccine is recommended from the age of 6 months for the 2017/18 epidemic season (grohskopf et al. 2017) . unfortunately, the highest percentage of hospitalizations and deaths is recorded in infants <6 months of age (zawłocka et al. 2016) . to protect newborns who are at high risk of complications after influenza infection, a cocoon vaccination strategy is recommended. people from the immediate infant environment, such as parents, grandparents, or siblings, are vaccinated against influenza, which protects the child against the illness in a secondary manner (nitsch-osuch 2017). the quadrivalent vaccines, which have been already developed, are recommended from the age of 3 years due to the lack of available research in younger children. this study seeks to define the prevalence of influenza infection in the population of children up to the age of 14 years and of the type of prevailing influenza virus causing infection among children during the 2017/18 epidemic season in poland.the study group included children up to 14 years of age, with an additional division into three successive age groups of 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years old. the material for the study were nasal and throat swabs taken during the 2017/18 epidemic season and analyzed in 16 voivodship sanitary and epidemiological stations and in the department of influenza research, national influenza center in the national institute of public health -national institute of hygiene (niph-nih) in warsaw, poland. during the epidemic season, 1286 samples were tested for influenza and reported in the sentinel and non-sentinel influenza surveillance system. the ribonucleic acid (rna) was isolated from the nasal and pharyngeal swabs. a maxwell 16 viral total nucleic acid purification kit was used (promega corporation; madison, wi), according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. from 200 μl of clinical samples, suspended in 1 ml of physiological saline, 50 μl of rna resuspended in rnase-free water was obtained. molecular tests were performed to confirm the presence of influenza a and b viruses and to determine the viral subtypes. the light cycler 2.0 system was used (roche diagnostics; rotkreuz, switzerland). the primers and probes were obtained from the international reagent resource (irr) run by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). the reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. rna was subjected to reverse transcription (at 50 c for 30 min). the obtained dna was subjected to the initiating denaturation process (1 cycle at 95 c for 2 min), followed by 45 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 c for 15 s, annealing at 55 c for 10 s, and elongation at 72 c for 20 s. positive control was the viral rna obtained from the strains used for the 2017/2018 vaccine (a/michigan/45/2015 (h1n1)pdm09, a/hongkong/4801/2014 (h3n2), and b/brisbane/60/2008/). negative control was the water free from rnase.using the rt-pcr reactions, the presence of the following respiratory viruses was confirmed: influenza a virus, influenza b virus, human respiratory syncytial virus a and b, human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus 229e/nl63, human coronavirus oc43, human parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4 viruses, human rhinovirus a/b/c, human enterovirus, and human bocavirus 1/2/3/4. the rv15 onestep ace detection kit (seeplex; seoul, south korea) was used for these reactions, according to the manufacturer's instructions. after the reaction, the product was separated on a 2% agarose gel using electrophoresis.discrete data were presented as counts and proportions.differences between the proportions of infected people were compared with a t-test. a value of zero was assumed for the noninfected person and a value of one for the infected one, and the arithmetic mean was used to calculate the percentage of the infected persons. a p-value <0.01 defined statistically significant differences. the prevalence of influenza in the age groups was determined with 95% confidence intervals (95%ci).in the 2017/18 epidemic season, there were 1286 samples tested from children up to 14 years of age. we noticed the co-dominance of influenza a and b viruses in the whole of children's population; 53.9% and 46.1%, respectively. among the influenza a viruses, subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 was confirmed in 18.5% of all positive samples and it prevailed over subtype a/h3n2/ (fig. 1) .in the children's population stratified into the age groups of 0-4, 5-9, and 10-14 years, influenza a virus dominated in 0-4 year olds, accounting for 28.8%. the infections caused by influenza b virus were noticed in 14.4% in this group. a different situation was noticed in the age groups of 5-9 and 10-14 years, where influenza b virus dominate, accounting for 34.1% and 31.5% of infections, respectively. in all three age groups, the unsubtyped infections of influenza a dominated, accounting for 17.8%, 17.2%, and 10.7% of infections, respectively, whereas subtype a/h3n2/was present in the lowest proportions; 0.4%, 1.2%, and 0.7%, respectively (fig. 2) .the results were also analyzed taking into account only the type of influenza virus and the patient's age. there were a significantly lower percentage of children infected with influenza a virus in the age group 10-14 years than in the groups 0-4 and 5-9 years ( p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). the difference in the number of influenza a virus infections between the age groups 0-4 and 5-9 years was insignificant ( p ¼ 0.21). in addition, there was a significantly higher percentage of children infected with influenza b virus in the age groups 5-9 and 10-14 years than in the group 0-4 years ( p < 0.001). the difference in the number of influenza b virus infections between the age groups 5-9 and 10-14 was insignificant ( p ¼ 0.28).a comparative analysis of the 2017/18 and 2016/17 epidemic seasons was also performed for the age group 0-4 years. in the former season, there was a clear dominance of influenza a (111 infections) and subtype a/h3n2/ (74 infections). in contradistinction, in the latter season, co-dominance of influenza a and b viruses (209 and 104 infections, respectively) was recorded. there was a clear difference in the dominant subtype of the influenza a virus. in the former season, it was subtype a/h3n2/, while in the latter season it was a/h1n1/pdm09. in the 2016/17 season, there were only two infections of influenza b virus and none of a/h1n1/pdm09 virus infection (fig. 3) .the influenza-like infections were reported in the 0-4 and 5-9 age groups and accounted for 81.2% and 18.8%, respectively (fig. 4) . among children aged 10-14 years, no influenza-like virus was reported. influenza-like viruses were dominated by rsv (30 infections). the highest number of infections with this virus was recorded in the age group 0-4 years. in this group, there also were four piv-3 infections and single infections with other influenza-like viruses. in the 2017/18 epidemic season, influenza a and b viruses co-dominated in the population of children under the age of 14 years, with a margin of influenza b over a. these results are akin to those noticed in other european countries, e.g., denmark or spain (flu news europe 2018). among the influenza a viruses, infections with subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 dominated over a/h3n2/. this season had entirely different characteristics from the preceding 2016/17 season in poland when no a/h1n1/pdm09 infections had been reported among children (cieślak et al. 2018 ).an interesting tendency appeared in the analysis of the prevailing viral contagion by children's age. in the older children of 5-9 and 10-14 years, there was a significantly higher incidence of influenza b infection than in the youngest children of 0-4 years. that is in line with the past results from other european research centers. in one of them, results from 12 european countries have been analyzed with reference to the 2012/13 season and the dominance of influenza b virus is reported in children aged 5-14 years (beauté et al. 2015) . in another study, the relation between influenza virus type and subtypes and the age of children was determined. that analysis covers 29 countries around the world in the years 1999-2014. it has been confirmed that infections with influenza b virus most often occur in the 5-17 age bracket (caini et al. 2018) .the present report demonstrates the lowest percentage of influenza a in the oldest children aged 10-14. further, infection with subtype a/h3n2/ constituted the lowest percentage of influenza a in each age group. this last trend seems to have been in line with the notion put forward by adlhoch et al. (2018) suggesting that subtype a/h3n2/ may be the most common in older persons, particularly aged over 65 rather than in children. this report also demonstrates that unsubtyped influenza a was the most prevalent across all the age groups of children. this finding, however, may contain a spurious component due to possibly ineffective subtyping of influenza virus or occasional lack of subtyping it at all. despite these limitations, we believe we have demonstrated in this report that there is a relation between the child's age and the type of influenza virus causing infection. in the 2017/18 epidemic season, the youngest children under 4 years were the most vulnerable to both influenza and influenza-like infections, the former caused mostly by influenza a and the latter by rsv. in contradistinction, influenza b dominated in the oldest children aged 10-14 and rsv infections were not present in this age group. however, characteristics of influenza viruses are highly changeable season to season. these data may thus not exactly apply to each and every epidemic season.acknowledgments supported by niph-nih grant 3/em. the authors thank the physicians and employees of vsess in the sentinel program for their help in the influenza surveillance in poland.the authors declare no conflict of interests in relation to this article.ethical approval all procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. the study was approved by an institutional ethics committee.informed consent informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study before collection of nasopharyngeal samples.seasonal influenza infection can be a burden on public health authorities. rapid diagnosis is an important initial step in the appropriate management of influenza disease. traditionally, viral cultures, serological tests, rapid antigen tests, and molecular methods have been used to diagnose influenza infection. 1 rapid influenza diagnostic tests (ridts) have been used widely in the clinical setting because they can be handled readily and at relatively low cost, although they have low and variable detection sensitivities. thus, a negative ridt result does not confirm a status free of influenza virus infection. the clinical sensitivities of these tests have been reported to range from 20% to 90%, according to sample collection method, storage and transport, specimen type, swab and transport media used, and degree of adherence to manufacturers' recommendations for test procedures. 1 the performance of ridts is also dependent on the prevalence of the influenza viruses circulating in the population. 2, 3 furthermore, clinicians should be cautious about using ridts in certain patient populations and with respect to how the results should be interpreted. [3] [4] [5] thus, further validation of ridts should be provided before routine clinical use. in this study, we compared three ridts with digital readout systems, and one conventional ridt, with respect to the detection sensitivity and relative limit of detection according to influenza subtype.we included 218 left-over nasopharyngeal swab specimens from non- buddi (nanoentek) is a newly developed digital readout system to diagnose influenza virus. the method is based on immunochromatography and a digital readout system. briefly, an antibody colloidal gold probe was applied on the conjugate pad, and influenza antibody was immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane as the capture reagent to prepare the ridt strip test. equal volumes of specimen in utm (75 μl) and reagent buffer (75 μl) were mixed thoroughly and five drops (100 μl) of mixed sample was loaded into the test device. in 15 minutes, the buddi device reads the intensity of the reaction band. if the band intensity is higher than a cut-off level, buddi reports a positive result of influenza infection. this test required less than 30 minutes to accomplish the qualitative detection of influenza antigen. the results of the buddi system can be transferred to a central laboratory or the centers for disease control (cdc) via an appropriate wireless network.the sofia influenza a+b fluorescence immunoassay (quidel) is a rapid diagnostic kit that uses immunofluorescence technology to enhance its sensitivity. it detects the nucleoprotein of the influenza virus and can discriminate strain a from b in nasal swabs, aspirates, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens. this test uses a lateral flow design with location-dependent lines and zones. the sofia analyzer scans the test strip and displays the results after using methodspecific algorithms. this assay can be completed within 15 minutes, and results are reported as positive or negative for influenza virus a or b, without providing the numerical value assigned for each specimen. briefly, equal volumes of specimen in utm (250 μl) and reagent buffer (prepared by reconstituting lyophilized buffer with detergent and reducing agent, 250 μl) were mixed in a reaction tube.a final volume of 120 μl of sample was placed in a sofia reaction cassette using a premeasured pipette, incubated for 15 minutes, and analyzed using the sofia fluorescent reader. the results also can be interfaced directly using a local area network (lan) to a laboratory information system.bd veritor system flu a+b assay (bd diagnostics) is a rapid qualitative chromatographic immunoassay for the detection of influenza a and b viral nucleoprotein antigens from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with a time-to-result of 10 minutes. the system comprises a unique reagent tube containing mucolytic agents and a detergent solution, a test device, and a digital reader. when nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens are processed with the reagent tube and added to the test device, influenza a or b viral antigens bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles in the test strip. the antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area, and is captured by antibodies against influenza a, influenza b, and a control antibody on three separate membranes. 6 for this study, 75 μl of specimen in utm was mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (75 μl). three drops (80 μl) of the mixed sample were placed into a veritor test device cassette and allowed 10 minutes for incubation. then, the cassette was placed into the colorimetric reader for analysis.is an immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection of influenza virus types a and type b using embedded mouse monoclonal anti-influenza a and anti-influenza b antibodies on the test strip. 7 briefly, 75 μl of nasopharyngeal specimen in utm was mixed with the same volume of reagent solution. the test strip was inserted into a tube containing the total volume of 150 μl of the reaction mixture. test results were examined visually and interpreted after 10-15 minutes.viral rnas were extracted from 530 μl of the nasopharyngeal specimen using the seeprep12 viral na kit (seegene) and the seeprep12 viral na instrument (seegene). this is an automated nucleic acid (na) extraction system for downstream detection, for extracting and purifying nas using a magnetic bead method. an internal control (10 μl) was added to each specimen before the extraction step to confirm the entire process, from na extraction to pcr. initial incubation at 50°c for 20 minutes and 95°c for 15 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95°c for 30 seconds and 55°c for 60 seconds.a comparison study was performed to compare the influenza subtype detection capacity among four different ridt assays using 20 different influenza antigen reagents from the national institute for biological standards and control (nibsc). first, the stock solution of each subtype reagent was diluted in the recommended buffer to 512 ng/ml. then, the 512 ng/ml nibcs influenza a subtypes were diluted serially to 128, 64, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 ng/ml. the 512 ng/ml nibcs influenza b subtypes were diluted serially to 128, 64, 16, and 8 ng/ml. the diluted subtype reagents were measured to determine and compare the detection limit of each ridt.the nonspecific positive results of four kinds of ridts with other respiratory viruses excluding influenza viruses were identified. all of 29 respiratory swab specimens were confirmed by real-time pcr (seegene rv16 real-time pcr, seegene seoul, korea) using manufacturer's recommended real-time pcr protocol. the rv16 realtime pcr has been updated from previous reports. the four ridts were compared according to sample volume, assay time, discrimination of influenza a and b, recommended specimen types, and test principles. we briefly describe the specifications of each ridt in table 1 . also, the 218 enrolled samples were classified as 73 cases of influenza a, 60 of influenza b, and 85 negatives ( table 2 ). serially diluted nibsc solutions showed some differences in low-level detection power between the ridts. overall, the digitalized influenza detection tests had a higher detection power than those of the con- we identified that four ridts did not show cross-reactivity results in 29 specimens which had other respiratory viruses excluding influenza viruses. these differences could be caused by different coverage levels of monoclonal antibodies to specific influenza subtypes. ridts should be updated to target prevalent influenza subtypes and to identify many influenza subtypes (to increase detection sensitivity).this study had some limitations. first, we did not include large number of samples and various influenza subtypes. second, the mean age of the enrolled individuals was relatively young, at 10-32.2 years, for a random selection within a specific period. cruz et al. 2 reported that the performance of ridts have been known to be better in children compared with adults (approximately 13% higher), maybe due to higher viral loads and longer viral shedding in children compared with adults. we also identified the higher sensitivity of four ridts in children group than those of adults in our study. third, test results were compared only with those of real-time pcr, which could have false positives and negatives. also, only nasopharyngeal swab specimens were included, without considering specimen variations. however, for the first time, this study presented the detection sensitivity of a newly developed digital readout system, buddi. the buddi had the same detection sensitivity as a previously launched ridt (veritor), and higher sensitivity than a conventional ridt. however, buddi showed less sensitivity than sofia. also, buddi could detect more than other ridts in terms of specific influenza biotypes, such as influenza a a/texas/36/91, a/beijing/262/95, and a/sydney/5/97.in conclusion, ridts with digital readout systems showed higher detection sensitivity than a conventional rapid test. the fluorescence technique of sofia gave it the highest detection sensitivity, but there were differences in low-level detection power according to influenza subtype. further well-designed prospective studies are needed for additional assessment of the value of updated ridts according to specific influenza subtypes.the collaborative research program of the n ational institute of allergy and infectious diseases is sponsoring a series of workshops on hepatitis as part of its overall hepatitis program, which has as its goal the development of methods for the prevention of hepatitis a and b. three recent workshops in this series include: (1) antigenic subtypes of australia antigen, december 17, 1971;  (2) hepatitis animal model systems, january 14, 1972; and (3) hepatitis and immune complexes, january 26-27, 1972.antigenic subtypes. the first of these three workshops focused on a discussion of the antigenic subtypes of hepatitis b. hepatitis b antigen (haa, hb ag,l or australia antigen) was first detected in the serum of an australian aborigine; later it was recognized that this antigen is associated with hepatitis b. it is now known that sera from patients with hepatitis b may manifest several immunologic specificities as demonstrated by the double-diffusion precipitin reacdon. at this meeting the participants agreed that an antigenic determinant known as a was common to all hepatitis b antigens thus far studied and may be regarded as the group-specific antigen. either the d or the y determinant, but not both, is usually associated with the groupspecific antigen a. the d subtype, possessing both a and d determinants, accounts for 40%-50% of cases, while y subtype, possessing both a and y determinants, also accounts for 40 %-50% of cases. in less than 1% of blood samples tested, only the a antigen is detected. this might be because the subtype antigens are too weak for detection, are blocked, are destroyed, or are not made; or it might be because a new, unidentified subtype is present. further research is needed to resolve the existence and character of other antigenic determinants. some of the evidence pre- 1 the abbreviation hb ag for hepatitis b antigen has been accepted by the committee on viral hepatitis of the division of medical sciences, national academy of sciences-national research council. however, pending editorial decision, the journal retains the old abbreviation, haa. 112 sented suggests that the y determinant is more likely to occur in acute, self-limited hepatitis than is the d determinant. as a corollary, d is more likely to be found in chronic hepatitis and in the chronic asymptomatic carrier. this association between chronicity and the d subtypes suggests that persistent antigenemia relates at least in part to the infecting agent rather than being solely determined by response of the host.it was reported that the 22-nm monomer forms of the ay and ad subtypes are composed of at least six polypeptides with varying amino-acid compositions. the participants of this workshop discussed nomenclature of subtypes and agreed that, until further information becomes available, the terms a, d, and y should continue to be used in describing antigenic determinants of hepatitis b.animal models. the workshop on hepatitis animal-model systems discussed methods of propagating the agents of hepatitis a and b. past attempts to propagate hepatitis agents in tissue culture have been either unsuccessful or unsubstantiated. recently, carver and seto [1] have exposed human wi-38 cells to human serum containing haa; these cells are then rendered refractory to infection by newcastle disease virus according to hemadsorption tests. this technique may represent one of the more promising approaches to growing the agent of hepatitis b in tissue culture. the use of nonhuman primates as animal models for hepatitis was discussed and analyzed as to its practicality. participants in this workshop reported some success in infecting the chimpanzee and the rhesus monkey with hepatitis b. it was reported that general susceptibility of primates to hepatitis b, as recognized by development of antibody to the hepatitis b antigen, appears to parallel the phylogenetic scale, with those primates closest to man being the most susceptible. studies on infection of primates with hepatitis a indicate that the marmoset can serve as a potential animal model for this type of hepatitis.it appears at this time that certain nonhuman primates (e.g., chimpanzees, gibbons, orangutans) cannot serve as practical laboratory models for research on hepatitis, since these animals are a limited resource, very expensive, and diffi-cult to handle and care for. the establishment of breeding colonies for such primates as saguinus mystax and macaca mulatta would be a great help in protecting the natural reservoir of these animals and in providing a source of good animals for research. as a consequence of the limited usefulness of certain nonhuman primates (chimpanzees, gibbons, etc.) in research on hepatitis, emphasis should be placed on development of tissue-culture techniques for growth of hepatitis agents and on development of potential materials for vaccines.immune complexes. the purposes of the workshop on immune complexes were to review current knowledge on immune complexes, to discuss the role that such antigen-antibody complexes might play on the pathogenesis of hepatitis b infection, and to attempt to formulate a hypothesis on the effects that the administration of gamma globulin with high titers of antibody to haa would have on the formation of hepatitis immune complex.circulating antigen-antibody complexes are detected by a variety of procedures, including (1 ) use of isolated rheumatoid factors which precipitate aggregates of gamma globulin and immune complexes but not free gamma globulin;(2) use of clq (an isolated component of complement) to precipitate immune complexes; (3) precipitation of immune complexes at low temperatures; and (4) use of the ultracentrifuge to separate complexes from free antigen and antibody. other techniques that might be used with various degrees of success to detect hepatitis immune complexes include electrophoresis, complement fixation, immunofluorescence, platelet aggregation, and electron microscopy. in the future, radioimmunoassay might be applied to the detection of hepatitis immune complexes.immune complexes may cause the following reactions: (1 ) activation of complement; (2 ) degranulation of mast cells with release of such substances as histamine; and (3) release of platelet, polymorphonuclear, and lysosomal contents. the pathophysiologic consequences of these reactions could include contraction of smooth muscle, increased vascular permeability, destruction of tissue, and proliferation of endothelial cells. it was pointed out that the large immune complexes (greater than 198) are most harmful, since they are not phagocytized and are deposited 113 in tissue, causing the above-mentioned damage to that tissue.the immune-complex syndrome might be summarized as follows: (1) formation of circulating antigen-antibody complexes; which cause (2) the release of vasoactive amines, followed by (3) increased vascular permeability leading to (4) deposit of the complexes along :filtering vascular membranes, which causes (5) either nonpolymorphonuclear-mediated vascular injury or polymorphonuclear-mediated vascular injury through activation of complement. deposition of immune complexes in the tissue might be due to deposition of circulating complexes or to deposit of antibody on cells in which viral replication takes place.current evidence supports the hypothesis that when the hepatitis b agent invades the body, two types of reactions are initiated. (1) the agent invades the liver cells, replicates, and antigen is released.(2) the hepatitis b agent stimulates the lymphoid system to produce antibodies. because of the presence of both the hepatitis-b antigen and antibody, immune complexes are formed, which may either circulate or remain in local tissue sites.electron microscopic studies of liver biopsies from persons positive for the hepatitis b antigen indicate a variety of hepatic involvements. immunohistochemical study of liver biopsies, using fluorescein-conjugated human antiserum to haa or by indirect immunofluorescence with guineapig antiserum to haa, demonstrates various patterns of distribution of this virus-associated antigen. the antigen is usually observed in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in a focal distribution within the liver. it is less commonly found diffusely in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. granular deposition of the antigen in nonhepatocytes, including kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and infiltrating mononuclear cells, is also seen, particularly in latter stages or during persistent infection. evidence that immunoglobulin and complement components are deposited together in the last group suggests intrahepatic localization of immune complexes of antibody to haa.an electron microscopic study of three cases of hepatitis, representing the carrier state, chronic active hepatitis, and fulminant hepatitis, showed the following antigenic patterns, respectively: (1) persistent antigen and no evidence of anti-body or complexes; (2) excess of antigen and presence of antigen-antibody complex; (3) excess of antibody and persistence of anaphylactogenic immune complexes. when there is free antigen, the patient is healthy, but with the development of antibody, hepatic function becomes abnormal.using the electron microscope, various investigators have seen dane particles (42 nm), which are composed of an outer core and an inner, spherical (27-nm diameter) component. the outer core appears to be antigenically related to haa, and the inner core bears some morphologic resemblance to the rhinovirus. the dane particle can be disrupted with tween 80 treatment into these two components, but the inner component may be unstable. antibody to haa and antibody to the inner core of the dane particle might be associated with hepatitis b, although the role of these two antibodies in immune-complex formation or in protective immunity to hepatitis b infection is yet to be determined. cell-mediated immune responses may also be involved in the conferral of immunity to hepatitis b. cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate and prostaglandins might also play a role in controlling the immune response to hepatitis b.based on different forms of evidence, the participants at the workshop agreed that hepatitis b disease may be complicated in certain cases by the formation of immune complexes. when these immune complexes lodge in the tissue, they initiate the typical immune-complex syndrome already outlined. it has been shown by various investigators that administration of certain gammaglobulin preparations can help prevent hepatitis b infection. it is not known whether the antibody to haa or some other antibody, such as antibody to the inner core of the dane particle, is the protective antibody. the effect of administration of gamma globulin with high titers of antiserum to haa on immune-complex formation is not yet known. particular caution should be exercised in administering gamma globulin to persons positive for hepatitis-b antigen.research during the past few years has shown that members of the newly defined coronavirus group have many properties in common. although coronaviruses cause illness in man, chickens, swine, mice, and rats, approaches to basic and comparative virology are seldom separable on the basis of species.on january 31, 1972, the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) sponsored an international workshop to review the relevance and relationship of the presently known coronaviruses, to identify specific problem areas of mutual concern and interest, and to offer an opportunity for free exchange of knowledge. nearly 20 investigators participated in the workshop, which was organized by the collaborative program of niaid under the direction of dr. robert j. byrne and was held at the national institutes of health, bethesda, maryland. dr. b. c. easterday, university of wisconsin, madison, served as chairman.in a discussion of comparative methods and problems, dr. m. tajima of the nippon institute for biological sciences, tokyo, described the fine structure of the nucleocapsid and the character of the nucleic acid of one of the coronaviruses, avian infectious bronchitis virus (lbv). he reported that, in his studies, most surface projections on ibv particles were lost during the process of purification. many particles contained spherical corelike structures corresponding in size, shape, and location to amorphous material in two other coronaviruses, strain 29 e human coronavirus and the transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine. purified virus treated with lipid solvents was completely disrupted with release of the contents of the virus, but corelike structures could not be identified.dr. j. d. almeida, electron microscopist at the royal post graduate medical school, london, england, described studies of antigenantibody coronavirus reactions. dr. almeida reported that it is possible to distinguish virus and host antigens on the surface of avian ibv. how-after the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, in order to track similarly highly contagious and severe lower respiratory illness with pneumonia symptoms, the chinese government has paid great attention to unexplained pneumonia (up), a phrase coined by the chinese human unexplained pneumonia surveillance network (chupsn) and published in 2004. up refers to pneumonia, which could be life-threatening, characterized by rapid progression, a normal white blood cell count range, and poor response to antibiotics. 1 although the common pathogens causing up are viruses or atypical pathogens, their overlapping clinical manifestations can impede the ability of clinicians to directly diagnose the causative pathogens, which may lead to unnecessary antimicrobial usage. thus, rapid and precise diagnosis of the causative agents is critical for the prompt management of up.to date, culture-based and other traditional methods have been used to help the clinical approach to diagnose up; however, these methods have certain disadvantages. for example, rapid antigen testing has only a 40%-100% sensitivity for adult influenza and is dependent on the use of specific scientific techniques, whereas culturing viruses can take up to 10 days. 2 in recent years, there has been an increase in the use of nucleic acid amplification test (naat)-based methods for the detection of viral pathogens due to their excellent diagnostic ability in identifying a broad spectrum of pathogens. 3 the prospective cohort was enrolled in shanghai, china, between within 24 hours of patient admission, respiratory tract specimens were collected, including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf: among those patients who gave consent to undergo bronchoscopy), sputum (if expectoration was evident), and nasopharyngeal swab (nps, if no bronchoscopy was performed or no expectoration sample was collected). notably, lower respiratory tract specimens were given higher priority (balf > sputum > nps) during the study. as soon as possible after sampling, the specimens were transferred to the laboratory of infectious diseases research institute, huashan hospital, shanghai.professional pulmonary physicians oversaw balf sampling, while the collection of nps and sputum was performed by clinical physicians per the clinical standard operating procedure. notably, those samples of nps and balf for which the viscosity was low required no further sample preparation before filmarray panel testing, whereas viscous samples, such as sputum, were pre-treated using the previously described dunk and swirl method. 5 the remaining specimens were stored in a −80°c freezer for further use.in this study, we used version 1.7 of the fa-rp. it is an automated multiplex pcr detection platform designed to detect 20 common pathogens causing respiratory infection and has a single specimen turnaround time of <2 hours. tests using the panel were performed following the manufacturer's instructions.for specimens that the fa-rp reported as "influenza a, not sub- for both patient groups, traditional standard-of-care laboratory diagnostic tests for respiratory infections were performed according to the requests of physicians, including smears, cultures, and serological tests. the serological test in our study was the pneumoslide igm (vircell) commercial kit based on indirect immunofluorescence.in this study, clinical data, including antimicrobial use, and adjustment or de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy, were compared between the fa-rp group and retrospective control group. turnaround time was defined as the length of time from sample collection to receiving the fa-rp results. antimicrobial use was quantified as the defined daily dose (ddd)) number, calculated as ∑ (drug total dosage (g)/drug ddd index). 6 adjustment of antimicrobial therapy was defined as a change in antimicrobial regimen immediately after receiving the fa-rp results.overview of patient enrollment workflow. a total of 112 patients selected prospectively were submitted to fa-rp analyses and are referred to as the "fa-rp group." those who were not lost to follow-up and had complete data are referred to as the "intervention group." comparison was made between it and the historical control groupthe mann-whitney u test was used for the comparison of quantitative data. spss 20.0 (ibm) was used for data analyses. we used graphpad 6.0 for drawing graphs. the ethics committee of the huashan hospital, shanghai, approved the study (ky2013-251; july 2, 2013). all participants gave their written informed consent. table 1 . mixed infections of multiple pathogens were detected in six patients: influenza virus/rsv (n = 1), influenza virus/human metapneumovirus (n = 1), influenza virus/parainfluenza-2 (n = 1), m pneumoniae/human rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 1), human rhinovirus/ enterovirus/parainfluenza-2 (n = 1), and adenovirus/coronavirus hku1/coronavirus oc43 (n = 1).for 13 samples, the fa-rp results were "influenza a/not subtyped." in these cases, further subtyping was performed using real-time rt-pcr. as a consequence, influenza a virus subtype h7n9 was detected in 11 samples and h1n1-2009 in the remaining two samples. as a consequence of the findings of the fa-fp regarding influenza a, 15 patients were isolated in a negative pressure ward or single ward, including seven highly pathogenic h7n9 cases. in contrast, in the control group, no comparable isolation measures were undertaken.when we compared antimicrobial use between the intervention and control groups, we found that the two groups were comparable for the most baseline characteristics (table 3) . compared with the control group, the intervention group showed no significant decrease of antimicrobial ddds (control group 14.3 ± 9.6 vs intervention group 13.8 ± 4.6, p > .05). however, after excluding antiviral drugs, we detected significantly lower antibiotic/antifungal ddds in this study, we applied fa-rp on diagnosis of up, which is a certain type of pneumonia causing mainly by viruses and atypical pathogens.we found that the fa-rp detected pathogens in 76.8% (86/112) of all specimens, which is higher than that the detection rate obtained when this technique was applied for general community-acquired pneumonia (38.6%, 49/127). 7 these results, therefore, show that when applied clinically for up, the fa-rp would provide a higher probability of identifying causal pathogenic microorganisms. in the present study, we found that 53.8% (60/112) of the patients in the fa-rp group received antiviral treatment, which is significantly higher than that in the control group (14.3%, 10/70; randomized controlled trial discovered that use of the fa-rp was not associated with a reduction in the overall duration of antibiotic usage. 18 nevertheless, a higher number of patients in the fa-rp group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than those in the control group. given these inconclusive findings, further studies are required concerning the impact of fa-rp on the clinical decisions regarding pneumonia.we compared the duration of hospital stay between the two groups. as a result, intervention group unexpectedly showed longer duration of hospital stay than the control group (12.1 vs 7.6 days, p = .001). one reasonable explanation is that subjects in the intervention group had more severe cases of pneumonia than those in the control group (higher psi, this present study is one of the several that have examined the application of fa-rp in asia. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] compared with other published studies, our study focused on adults with more severe pneumonia conditions, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the only study that our study does, however, have a few limitations. notably, the sample size was limited, and the study was conducted only at a single location, which may thus limit the general applicability of the findings. in addition, the study included two cohorts from different time periods; hence, there may have been differences in factors that influenced clinician behavior between the two periods that were not accounted in our analysis. furthermore, the incidence of various respiratory viruses may have varied across the two periods that may thus limit the validity of a direct comparison of clinical outcomes.in conclusion, the fa-rp is a rapid and sensitive naat method that can be used for the diagnosis of up in adults. in the two recent years in shanghai, the most common pathogen causing up was identified as the influenza virus. however, in this regard, it should be taken into consideration that the current version of the fa-rp is unable to directly detect h7n9. nevertheless, the results obtained in this study show that the fa-rp may make a valuable contribution to clinical decision making and facilitate the reasonable use of antibiotics.we would like to thank yinlei zhang, tracy wang, xuyang wang, and xinchang chen for their substantial contributions to this study.yiyi qian https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0714-3894the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has posed crucial threats to public health and the world economy since it was detected in wuhan, china, in december 2019. 15 as of june 1, 2020, 6 057 853 cases of covid-19 have been reported in more than 200 countries and territories, resulting in more than 371 166 deaths. 27 however, there have been no signs of slowing down nor relief at this monument partially due to the fact there are no specific anti-sars-cov-2 drugs and effective vaccines.sars-cov-2 is a positive-strand rna virus that belongs to the beta coronavirus genus. the genomic information underpins the development of antiviral medical interventions, prophylactic vaccines, and viral diagnostic tests. the first sars-cov-2 genome was reported on january 5, 2020. 28 it has a genome size of 29.99 kb, which encodes for multiple nonstructural and structural proteins. the leader sequence and orf1ab encode nonstructural proteins for rna replication and transcription. among various nonstructural proteins, viral papain-like (pl) proteinase, main protease (or 3cl protease), rna polymerase, and endoribonuclease are the common targets in antiviral drug discovery. yet, it typically takes more than ten years to put an average drug to the market. the downstream regions of the genome encode structural proteins, including spike (s) protein, envelope (e) protein, membrane (m) protein, and nucleocapsid (n) protein. notably, s-protein uses one of its two subunits to bind directly to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), enabling virus entry into host cells. 29 the n protein, one of the most abundant viral proteins, can bind to the rna genome and is involved in replication, assembly, and host cellular response during viral infection. 13 as a virulence factor, the e protein is a small integral membrane protein that regulates cell stress response and apoptosis and promotes inflammation. 4 the structural protein, especially, the s protein, is the candidate antigen for vaccine and antibody drug development. developing safe and effective vaccines is urgently needed to prevent the spread of sars-cov-2. however, it typically takes over one year to design and test a new vaccine. furthermore, the replication in rna viruses, such as influenza a, is subject to errors, 14 except nidoviruses. coronaviruses, a kind of nidoviruses, have the ability to proofread their genomes during their genetic replication and recombination. 6 therefore, sars-cov-2 might not mutate as fast as influenza a viruses do, but still has heterogeneous and dynamic populations. the sars-cov-2 genome undergoes rapid mutations that are partially stimulated as a response to the challenging immunological environments arising from its transmission to the covid-19 patients of different races, ages, and medical conditions.the vaccine developed at one time may not be effective for mitigating the infection by new mutated virus isolates. an alarming fact is that many of these mutations may devastate the ongoing effort in the development of effective medicines, preventive vaccines, and diagnostic tests. accurate identification of the antigens and their mutations represents the most important roadblock in developing effective vaccines against covid-19. for example, different vaccines are needed for various geographic locations due to predominant mutations in the corresponding regions. in covid-19 diagnosis, the diagnostic kits are designed using two major methods: serological tests and molecular tests. serological tests are to detect specific neutralizing antibodies from covid-19 infections. molecular diagnoses look for specific covid-19 pathogenic genes, which usually rely on the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). because of the fast mutations of the sars-cov-2 genome, genotyping analysis of sars-cov-2 may optimize the pcr primer design to detect sars-cov safely and to reduce the risk of false-negatives caused by genome sequence variations. in addition, the genotyping analysis may also reveal those highly conserved regions with very few mutations, which can be selected as a target sequence for clinical diagnosis and effective drug therapy.the evolution pattern through the highly frequent mutations of sars-cov-2 can be observable on short time scales. in the early infection period (i.e., february 2020), the sars-cov-2 variants were clustered as s and l types. 23 recent genotyping analysis reveals a large number of mutations in various essential genes encoding the s protein, the n protein, and the rna polymerase in the sars-cov-2 population. 30 monitoring the evolutionary patterns and spread dynamics of sars-cov-2 is of great importance for covid-19 control and prevention.mutations occur in many different ways. some mutations occur randomly. other mutations are enforced by the host immune system surveillance, which induces viral responses. the most preserved mutations and viral evolution can be regarded as the result of the dynamic equilibrium between the random perturbation, host cell defense, and viral fitness. therefore, the faster and wider the sars-cov-2 spread, the more frequent and diverse the mutations will be. the tracking and analysis of covid-19 dynamics, transmission, and spread are of paramount importance for winning the ongoing battle against covid-19. genetic identification and characterization of the geographic distribution, intercontinental evolution, and global trends of sars-cov-2 are the most effective approaches for studying covid-19 genomic epidemiology and offer the molecular foundation for region-specific sars-cov-2 vaccine design, drug discovery, and diagnostic development. 16 for example, different vaccines for the shell can be designed according to predominant mutations.this work provides the most comprehensive genotyping to reveal the transmission trajectory and spread dynamics of covid-19 to date. based on genotyping 15 140 sars-cov-2 genomes from the world as of june 1, 2020, we trace the covid-19 transmission pathways and analyze the distribution of the subtypes of sars-cov-2 across the world. we use kmeans methods to cluster sars-cov-2 mutations, which provides updated molecular information for the region-specific design of vaccines, drugs, and diagnoses. our clustering results show that, globally, there are at least six distinct subtypes of sars-cov-2 genomes. while, in the u.s., there are four significant sars-cov-2 genotypes. we introduce mutation hindex and mutation ratio to characterize conservative and nonconservative proteins and genes. we unveil the unexpected nonconservative genes and proteins, rendering a warning for the current development of diagnostic tests, preventive vaccines, and therapeutic medicines.2.1. covid-19 evolution and clustering. tracking the sars-cov-2 transmission pathways and analyzing the spread dynamics are critical to the study of genomic epidemiology. temporospatially clustering the genotypes of sars-cov-2 in the transmission provides insights into diagnostic testing and vaccine development in disease control. in this work, we retrieve and genotype 15 140 sars-cov-2 isolates from the world as of june 1, 2020. there are 8309 single mutations in 15 140 sars-cov-2 isolates. based on these mutations, we classify and track the geographical distributions of 15 140 genotype isolates by k-means clustering. the sars-cov-2 genotypes, represented as single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) variants, are clustered as six groups in the world, including the u.s.. in particular, the genotypes in the u.s. are further clustered into four groups. table 1 lists the comutations with the highest number of descendants in different clusters in the world. optimal clustering groups are established using the elbow method in the k-means clustering algorithm (supporting information).the detailed distribution of the snp variants from the world for each cluster is provided in the supporting information. the snp variant clusters from 76 countries that have a high number of the covid-19 cases are listed in table 2 . the pie chart plot on the world map is described in figure 1 which was created by highcharts (https://www.highcharts.com/maps/demo). the light blue, dark blue, green, red, purple, and yellow represent the cluster i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi, respectively. the color of the dominated cluster decides the base color of each country. the geographic distribution of the snp variant clusters reflects the approximate transmission pathways and spread dynamics across the world. several findings can be made from furthermore, we analyze the statistics of snp variants located in the united states. in table 3 table 4 lists the co-mutations with the highest number of descendants in different clusters in the united states. notably, several findings on the genotypes of clusters in the us are as follows:1. the subtypes of sars-cov-2 in all of the clusters are spreading out among the west coast states. especially, the state of washington is dominated by cluster b. 2. east coast states are dominated by subtypes from clusters a and c, especially in new york. 3. the subtypes of sars-cov-2 in cluster a are spread throughout the united states. figure 2 is the pie chart plot of the four distinct clusters in the us, which was also created by highcharts. the colors, blue, red, yellow, and green represent clusters a, b, c, and d, respectively. the base color of each state corresponds to its dominant cluster. we note that cluster d in the u.s. is derived from cluster v in the world, with an additional mutation at the leader sequence 241. the high spread in new york is consistent with the high transmission of sars-cov-2 in european countries, where the subtype in cluster v is predominant.2.2. ramifications for covid-19 diagnosis, vaccine, and medicine. 2.2.1. protein-specific mutation analysis. figures 3 and 4 depict the distribution and frequencies of snp mutations of sars-cov-2 isolates from 15 140 genome samples in the world with respect to the reference genome of january 5, 2020. the statistics of single mutations on various sars-cov-2 proteins that occurred in the recorded genomes between january 5, 2020, and june 1, 2020, are listed in table  5 . the spike protein has the highest number of mutations on gene of 1004, while the envelope protein has the lowest number of mutations of 52. since the sizes of proteins vary dramatically from 1273 for the spike protein to 75 for the envelope protein, it is useful to consider the mutation ratio, i.e., the number of mutations per residue. in this category, the rna-dependent rna polymerase has the lowest score of 0.217, whereas the nucleocapsid protein has the highest score of 0.400, i.e, 503 mutations on its 1257 nucleotides (419 residues). note that main protease has the second-lowest mutation ratio of 0.221, indicating its conservative nature. another relatively conservative protein judged by the mutations ratio in terms of gene is the envelope protein, the mr gene = 0.231.counting the number of single mutations and mutation ratio does not reflect the fact that some mutations occur numerous times over genome samples while other mutations may happen only on a few genome samples. to account for the frequency effect of mutations, we introduce a mutation h-index to measure both the number of mutations and the frequency of mutations of a given protein or genetic section. it is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given protein genetic section has h single mutations that have each occurred at least h times. it is very interesting to note from table 5 that the mutation h-index correlates very well with the number of mutations on gene; the pearson correlation coefficient is 0.711. specifically, n protein has both the highest mr gene of 0.400 and the highest h-index of 33, suggesting that it is the most nonconservative protein in sars-cov-2 genomes. in contrast, the envelope protein has the third-lowest number of mutations per residues of 0.231 and the lowest h-index of 9, indicating its relatively conservative nature. by combining the number of mutations per residue and the mutation h-index, we report that the most conservative sars-cov-2 proteins is the envelope. it is found that the most nonconservative sars-cov-2 proteins are (1) the nucleocapsid protein, (2) the spike protein, and (3) the papain-like protease.the number of mutations in terms of gene (nm gene ) and the number of mutations in terms of protein (nm pro ) we reported are accumulated numbers that from all of the 15 140 genome isolates. if we focus on the single genome isolate, the maximum number of mutations on the whole genome sequence is 24.2.2.2. diagnosis. real-time rt-pcr (rrt-pcr) is routinely used in the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from sars-cov-2 for diagnostic testing covid-19. 3,24 the primers used in the rrt-pcr are critical for the precise diagnosis of covid-19 and the discovery of new strains. the primer sequences are specially designed for amplifying the conserved regions across the different existing strains for high specificity and sensitivity and also are subject to genotype changes as the sars-cov-2 coronavirus evolves. in diagnostic testing covid-19, many rrt-pcr primers are designed to detect for three perceived conservative sars-cov-2 regions:(1) rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) gene in orf1ab region, (2) the e protein gene, and (3) the n protein gene. 3 our genotyping statistics given in table 5 indicate that the nucleocapsid protein is the worst choice. among the four structural proteins of sars-cov-2, the spike surface glycoprotein (s) of 1273 amino acid residues, nucleocapsid protein (n) of 419 amino acid residues, membrane protein (m) of 222 amino acid residues, and envelope protein (e protein) of 75 amino acid residues, the s journal of chemical information and modeling pubs.acs.org/jcim article protein is the most divergent with 1004 unique mutations among the 15 140 sars-cov-2 genomes. the n protein has 503 unique mutations, and the envelope (e) protein has 52 mutations. considering the lengths of the proteins, all the four structural proteins undergo many mutations. the rdrp gene, which is often used in diagnostic testing covid-19, also has 607 mutations. therefore, all three regions in the routine rrt-pcr target, namely rdrp, the n protein gene, and the e protein genes, have significant mutations. precise and robust diagnosis tools must be re-established according to the conserved regions and predominated mutations in the sars-cov-2 genomes detailed in the supporting information.2.2.3. vaccine development. vaccines are mostly associated with the s protein. compared to sars-cov, sars-cov-2 has a unique furin cleavage site, where four amino acid residues (prra) are inserted into the s1−s2 junction region 681−684 of the s protein. 25 the furin cleavage site is crucial for zoonotic transmission of sars-cov-2. 7 this study reveals crucial mutations near the s1−s2 junction region in the s protein, including 23403a>g-(d614g), 23422c>t-(v620v), 23575c>t-(c671c), 23586a>g-(q675r), 23611g>a-(r683r), 23707c>t-(p715p), 23731c>t-(t723t), 23849t>c-(l763l), and 23929c>t-(y789y). moreover, these mutations of the s protein sars-cov-2 are located at the epitope region, corresponding to the regions 469−882 and 599−620 in sars-cov. 19 additionally, many mutated amino acids are on the receptorbinding domain (rbd) of the s protein, as shown in figure 5 .unfortunately, the s protein is the second most nonconservative protein in the genome based on the number of mutations per residue and mutation h-index. in fact, about half of the receptor-binding domain residues of the s proteins have had mutations in the past few months as shown in figure 6 . because the surface accessibility of epitope is also important for the interaction of antibody and antigen, these mutations are critical for the antigenicity of the s protein.convalescent covid-19 patients show a neutralizing antibody response after infection, which is directed mostly against the s protein. 18 the neutralizing antibody responses against sars-cov-2 could give some defense against sars-cov-2 infection, thus having implications for preventing sars-cov-2 outbreaks. the divergence of s proteins and the nonconserved regions of the s proteins might contribute to the antigenicity. the highly frequent mutations identified in the s protein may reduce the durability of the sars-cov-2 vaccine's immunity or undermine the current development of vaccines. the existing mutations must be considered when designing a new vaccine. additionally, a cocktail of multiple vaccines has a better chance of preventing covid-19 infections.2.2.4. drug discovery. unfortunately, there is no specific effective drug for sars-cov-2 at this point. potential drugs include small-molecular drugs and antibody drugs. much of the effort in small-molecular drug discovery focuses on sars-cov-2 nonstructural proteins. among the major nonstructural proteins of sars-cov-2, the main protease of 306 amino acids has 78 mutations with 0.255 mutations per residue and the mutation h-index of 16, rna polymerase of 932 amino acids has 228 mutations with 0.245 mutations per residue and the mutation h-index of 21, and papain-like protease of 945 amino acids has 105 mutations with 0.333 mutations per residue and the mutation h-index of 10. in fact, the main protease is the most popular drug target because there are no similar known genes in the human genome, which implies that sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors will likely be less toxic. 10 the present study suggests that the main protease is the second most conservative protein. therefore, it remains the most attractive target for drug discovery.therapeutic antibodies got started from cancer treatments and now applies to infectious diseases by targeting pathogens. 1 antibody drugs are highly specificity and versatile in the treatment of infectious diseases. their working principle involves the host immune system. the time used to develop antibody therapeutics are usually considerably shorter than that used to develop a vaccine. many sars-cov-2 antibody drugs are isolated from patient blood and target the s proteins. although there many binding sites on the s protein that antibodies can target, the ones that are most effective in neutralizing sars-cov-2 block the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor. the rbd is a dongle-shape protein at the journal of chemical information and modeling pubs.acs.org/jcim article end of the virus's spikes. as mentioned above, there are many mutations on the s proteins. the rbd is also prone to mutations. some mutations that break hydrogen bonds and/or salt bridges in antibody−antigen interactions will have a large impact. however, silent mutations, such as those that replace hydrophobic residues with other hydrophobic residues, will typically have little effect. to avoid the failure of one specific antibody, the cocktail treatments that include several different antibodies might be required to treat sars-cov-2 that undergoes antigenic mutations.the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein, or s protein, comprised of two subunits, s1 and s2, of very different properties; 25 see figure 5 . among them, the s1 subunit, as shown in figure 5 , contains the receptor-binding domain (rbd) responsible for binding to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2). the rbd is also the common binding domain for antibodies. the s2 subunit offers the structural support of the s protein and mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. after the fusion, the virus releases the viral genome into the host cell.the s1 rbd protein plays key parts in the induction of neutralizing-antibody and t-cell responses, as well as protective immunity. however, s2 and extracellular domain (ecd) of spike protein and their combination are commonly used in recombinant proteins in sars-cov-2 antibody development.as shown in table 5 , the s protein is the most heterogeneous structural protein with a significant number of mutations as shown in figures 5 and 6 and table 6 . the divergence of the spike protein, the nonconserved regions of the spike protein might contribute to the antigenicity difference in sars-cov-2 isolates. we found that most of the high frequent mutations of the s protein are located in the s1 subunit. figure 6 indicates that near half of the amino acid residues have had mutations since january 5, 2020. one of the important mutations at s1 is 23010t>c (v483a) within the rbd for ace2 binding, and the total frequency of 23010t>c (v483a) is 23. the structural study revealed that the amino acids 442−487 in the s1 subunit may impact viral binding to human ace2. 9, 26 the mutations identified in this study imply the change in ace2 binding affinity and the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 as well as negative impacts in preventive vaccine and diagnostic test development.2.2.5.2. main protease. sars-cov-2 main protease, or 3cl protease, is essential for cleaving the polyproteins that are translated from the viral rna. 10 it operates at multiple cleavage sites on the large polyprotein through the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins and plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication. sars-cov-2 main protease is one of the most attractive targets for anti-cov drug design because its inhibition would block viral replication and it is unlikely to be toxic due to no known similar human proteases. another reason for the focused drug discovery efforts in developing sars-cov-2 main protease inhibitors is that this protein is relatively conservative as shown in table 5 . figure 7 illustrates the main protease mutation patterns. figure 8 further highlights the inhibitor binding domain (bd). i  cluster ii  cluster

protein. table 7 lists top 10 mutations and their frequency in our data set. it is interesting to see that many mutations, such as d176d, r298r, n151n, are degenerate ones. one possible explanation is that nondegenerates may be nonsilent and likely cause unsurvivable disruption to the virus. note that mutation g15s mostly occurs in cluster iv. mutation r298r is restricted to cluster iv. some other mutations, such as d248e, a266v, n151n, and t45i are specific to certain clusters. nonetheless, some mutations at the bd shown in figure 8 are worth noting. they can undermine the ongoing drug discovery effort.protease. sars-cov-2 papain-like protease (plpro) is a cysteine cleavage protein located within the nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) section of the viral genome. 17 like the main protease, plpro activity is required to cleave the viral polyprotein into functional, mature subunits and, thereby, contributes to the biogenesis of the virus replication. additionally, plpro possesses a deubiquitinating activity. the sars plpro is also a major therapeutic and diagnostic target.as shown in table 5 , the sars plpro is prone to mutations. figure 9 shows that mutations are all over the places in plpro. table 8 lists the top 10 mutations in plpro. three of these mutations are degenerate ones. note that only two of the top mutations occurred in cluster ii. in contrast, cluster i has many different mutations.2.2.5.4. rna polymerase. sars rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of the sars rna strand complementarily to the sars-cov-2 rna template and is thus essential to the replication of sars-cov-2 rna. 8 as one of the nonstructural proteins, rdrps are located in the early part of orf1b section. like most other rna viruses, sars-cov-2 rdrps are considered to be highly conserved to maintain viral functions and thus targeted in antiviral drug development as well as diagnostic tests. on the other hand, the sars-cov-2 rna polymerase lacks proofreading capability and thus its mutations are deemed to happen as shown in table 5 . figure 10 illustrates the sars-cov-2 rdrp mutations since january 5, 2020. surprisingly, there are many mutations in sars-cov-2 rdrp. table 9 describes the top 10 mutations. as in other cases, five of these mutations are degenerate ones.2.2.5.5. endoribo-nuclease. endoribo-nuclease (nendou) protein is a nidoviral rnauridylate-specific enzyme that cleaves rna. 11 it contains a c-terminal catalytic domain belonging to the nendou family rna processing. the nendou protein is presented among coronaviruses, arteriviruses, and toroviruses. the many aspects of the detailed function and activity of sars-cov-2 nendou protein are yet to be revealed. figure 11 depicts sars-cov-2 nendou protein mutations. as in most other sars-cov-2 proteins, mutations have occurred over different parts. table 5 shows that nendou is relatively conservative. table 10 lists the top 10 high-frequency mutations of the sars-cov-2 nendou protein that occurred in the past few months. four of these mutations are degenerate ones. the frequencies of these mutations range from 153 to 15. note that cluster vi only has one of these mutations.2.2.5.6. envelope protein. the sars-cov-2 envelope (e) protein is one of sars-cov's four structural proteins. as a transmembrane protein, it involves in ion channel activity and thus facilitates viral assembly, budding, envelope formation, pathogenesis, and release of the virus. 22 the e protein may not be essential for viral replication, but it is for pathogenesis. figure 12 illustrates e protein as a very small pentamer with a few mutations. table 11 shows its top 10 mutations. note that the first four mutations are degenerate ones. all other mutations have relatively low frequencies. as shown in table 5 , the sars-cov-2 e protein is very conservative.2.2.5.7. nucleocapsid protein. sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid (n) protein 2 is another structural protein. its primary function is to encapsidate the viral genome. to do so, it is heavily phosphorylated (or charged) and, thereby, can bind with rna. additionally, sars-cov-2 n protein confirms the viral genome to replicase-transcriptase complex (rtc) and plays i  cluster ii  cluster iii  cluster iv  cluster v  cluster vi   top1  10097g>a  g15s  224  23  0  1  200  0  0  top2

different stages of the viral life cycle. sars-cov-2 n protein is considered to be one of the most conservative sars-cov-2 proteins in the literature and is a popular target for diagnosis of vaccine development. 3 the present works shown in table 5 indicate that the sars-cov-2 n protein is the worst target of any drug, vaccine, and diagnostic development. figure 13 is the illustration of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein mutations using 6vyo as a template. table 12 presents the top 10 mutations of the sars-cov-2 n protein since january 5, 2020. note that only 2 out of the top 10 mutations are degenerate ones, which is a significantly lower ratio than that of other proteins. the frequency of 10th mutation is 78, which suggests there are many mutations associated with these mediate-sized proteins. most top mutations occurred to clusters i, iii, and iv. clusters v and vi have almost none of the top 10 mutations.2.2.5.8. membrane protein. sars-cov-2 membrane (m) protein is another structural protein and plays a central role in viral assembly and viral particle formation. it exists as a dimer in the virion and has certain geometric shapes to enable certain membrane curvature and binding to nucleocapsid proteins. similar to other sars-cov proteins, m protein is also a popular target for viral diagnosis and vaccines. table 5 gives sars-cov-2 m protein the middle ranking for its conservation. table 13 details the top 10 mutations in sars-cov-2 m protein that occurred in the past few months. eight of these mutations are degenerate. clusters i and v have relatively a few of these mutations. i  cluster ii  cluster iii  cluster iv  cluster v  cluster vi   top1  5142c>t  t808i  41  0  0  41  0  0  0  top2  5730c>t  t1004i  22  3  0  4  9  2  4  top3

protein mutations using 6vww as a template.3. material and methods 3.1. data collection and preprocessing. on january 5, 2020, the complete genome sequence of sars-cov-2 was first released on genbank (access number: nc_045512.2) by zhang's group at fudan university. 28 since then, there has been a rapid accumulation of sars-cov-2 genome sequences. in this work, 15 140 complete genome sequences with high coverage of sars-cov-2 strains from the infected individuals in the world have been downloaded from the gisaid database 20 (https://www.gisaid.org/) as of june 1, 2020. all the records in gisaid without the exact submission date were not taken into considerations. to rearrange the 15 140 complete genome sequences according to the reference sars-cov-2 genome, multiple sequence alignment (msa) was carried out by using clustal omega 21 with default parameters.3.2. snp genotyping. snp genotyping measures the genetic variations between different members of a species. establishing the snp genotyping method for the investigation of the genotype changes during the transmission and evolution of sars-cov-2 is of great importance. by analyzing the rearranged genome sequences, snp profiles which record all of the snp positions in teams of the nucleotide changes and its corresponding positions can be constructed. the snp profiles of a given genome of a covid-19 patient capture all the differences from a complete reference genome sequence and can be considered as the genotype of the individual sars-cov-2.3.3. distance of snp variants. the jaccard distance measures dissimilarity between sample sets. the jaccard distance of snp variants is widely employed in the phylogenetic analysis of human or bacterial genomes. 30 in this work, we utilize the jaccard distance to compare the

between the snp variant profiles of sars-cov-2 genomes. the jaccard similarity coefficient, also known as the jaccard index, is defined as the intersection size divided by the union of two sets a, b: 12the jaccard distance of two sets a, b is scored as the difference between one and the jaccard similarity coefficient and is a metric on the collection of all finite sets:therefore, the genetic distance of two genomes corresponds to the jaccard distance of their snp variants. if a ∩ b ≠ ⌀, a ⊂ b, and b ⊂ a, then we say these two snp variants are relatives. if a ⊂ b, then a is the ancestor of b and b is the descendant of a.in principle, the jaccard distance measure of snp variants takes account of the ordering of snp positions, i.e., transmission trajectory, when an appropriate reference sample is selected. however, one may fail to identify the infection pathways from the mutual jaccard distances of multiple samples. in this case, the dates of the sample collections offer useful information. additionally, clustering techniques, such as k-means described below, enable us to characterize the spread of covid-19 onto the communities.3.4. k-means clustering. k-means clustering is one of the fundamental unsupervised algorithms in machine learning which aims at partitioning a given data set x = {x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n , ..., x n }, x n ∈  d into k clusters {c 1 , c 2 , ..., c k }, k ≤ n such that the specific clustering criteria are optimized. more specifically, the standard k-means clustering algorithm starts to pick k points as cluster centers randomly and then allocates each data to its nearest cluster. the cluster centers will be updated iteratively by minimizing the within-cluster sum of squares (wcss) which is defined bywhere μ k is the mean of points located in the kth cluster c k and n k is the number of points in c k . here, ∥•∥ 2 denotes the l 2 distance. the algorithm above only provides a way to obtain the optimal partition for a fixed number of clusters. however, we are interested in finding the best number of clusters for the snp variants. therefore, the elbow method is applied. by varying the number of clusters k, a set of wcss can be calculated in the k-means clustering process, and then the plot of wcss according to the number of clusters k can be carried out. the location of the elbow in this plot will be considered as the optimal number of clusters. to be noticed, the wcss measures the variability of the points within each cluster which is influenced by the number of points n. therefore, as the number of total points of n increases, the value of wcss becomes larger. additionally, the performance of k-means clustering depends on the selection of the specific distance.in this work, we propose to implement k-means clustering with the elbow method for analyzing the optimal number of the subtypes of sars-cov-2 snp variants. the jaccard distance-based and location-based representations are considered as the input features for the k-means clustering method.3.4.1. jaccard distance-based representation. suppose we have a total of n snp variants concerning a reference genome in a sars-cov-2 sample. the location of the mutation sites for each snp variant will be saved in the set s i , i = 1, 2, ..., n. the jaccard distance between two different sets (or samples) s i , s j is denoted as d j (s i , s j ). therefore, the n × n jaccard distance-based representation will be i  cluster ii  cluster iii  cluster iv  cluster v  cluster vi   top1  28881g>a  r203k  3083  100  1  17  2963  1  1  top2  28882g>a

gisaid every day, which results in an ever-growing massive quantity of high dimensional data representations for the k-means clustering. for example, if the data set of an organism involves 10 000 snps, the initial representation will be a 10 000-dimensional vector for each sample, which can be computationally difficult for a simple k-means clustering algorithm. therefore, a dimensionality reduction method is used to preprocess the data. the essential idea of pca-based k-means clustering is to invoke the pca to obtain a reduced-dimensional representation of each sample before performing the k-means clustering. in practice, one can select a few lowest dimensional principal components as the k-means input for each sample. in ref 5, the authors proved that the principal components are the continuous solution of the cluster indicators in the k-means clustering method, which provides us a rigorous mathematical tool to embed our high-dimensional data into a lowdimensional pca subspace.the rapid global transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has offered some of the most heterogeneous, diverse, and challenging mutagenic environments to stimulate dramatic genetic evolution and response from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). this work provides the most comprehensive genotyping of sars-cov-2 transmission and evolution up to date based on 15 140 genome samples and reveals six clusters of the covid-19 genomes and associated mutations on eight different sars-cov-2 proteins. we introduce mutation h-index and mutation ratio to qualify individual protein's degree of nonconservativeness. we unveil that sars-cov-2 envelope protein, main protease, and endoribonuclease protein are relatively the most conservative, whereas sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and papain-like protease are relatively the most nonconservative. we report that all of the sars-cov-2 proteins have undergone intensive mutations since january 5, 2020, and some of these mutations might seriously undermine ongoing efforts on covid-19 diagnostic testing, vaccine development, antibody therapeutics, and small-molecular drug discovery.the nucleotide sequences of the sars-cov-2 genomes used in this analysis are available, upon free registration, from the gisaid database (https://www.gisaid.org/). eighteen tables are provided in the supporting information for snp variants of 15 140 sars-cov-2 samples across the world, snp variants of 4587 sars-cov-2 samples in the us, snp variants in six global clusters, snp variants in four us clusters, and mutation records for eight sars-cov-2 proteins. the acknowledgments of the sars-cov-2 genomes are also given in the supporting information.the supporting information is available free of

been an increase in influenza a variant detections in the us in recent years. in september 2012, an ontario resident was diagnosed with influenza a (h1n1) variant infection. the demonstrated cross reactivity with the a(h1n1)pdm09 h1 gene cdc realtime pcr suggests that laboratories that only use the pdm09 h1 gene pcr to confirm this subtype would incorrectly report this variant as a a(h1n1)pdm09 subtype unless they were doing further molecular investigations.© 2013 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.there has been an increase in influenza a variant detections in the us in recent years. [1] [2] [3] influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine are called "variant" viruses when they are found in people. 4 from december 2005 to september 21, 2012, 326 influenza a(h3n2) variant (v), 14 a(h1n1)v and 5 a(h1n2)v cases have been identified. 5 in september 2012, a 37 year old male ontario resident was diagnosed with influenza a h1n1v infection. this was the first detection of this variant influenza strain in an individual in canada. the case, who has an unknown influenza immunization history, had recently traveled within canada during which time he had close contact with swine, and to the united states where he had close contact with cattle; attendance at swine fairs could not be ascertained. at the beginning of september, he became ill with gastrointestinal symptoms of unknown etiology, followed by acute respiratory symptoms and on september 9 was admitted to a local area hospital with pneumonia. following a 2-day admission he was discharged from hospital, but was re-admitted on september 13 with worsening respiratory symptoms, and subsequently was transferred to a tertiary care center where he required admission to an intensive care unit. the case had two separate treatment courses of oseltamivir administered.the first course was for five days (75 mg twice daily) starting on september 16, 2012. he had a second seven-day course of 150 mg twice daily starting on september 21, 2012. at time of writing the case had been discharged home following an extended stay in intensive care, however additional travel and exposure information was unattainable. only one close contact of the case reported symptoms of influenza-like illness (ili); that person tested negative for influenza.phol performs a large proportion of primary respiratory viral testing for the province of ontario from a variety of clinical settings including ambulatory, hospital and outbreaks. specimens from all hospitalized and outbreak patients are tested for influenza a matrix gene and influenza b ns1 gene using cdc protocols. if influenza a-positive, subtyping for seasonal influenza a (h3n2) ha gene (cdc assay) and influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 na gene (in-house assay) are performed. 6 following the emergence of h3n2v infections in the us in 2011, phol implemented screening of a selection of influenza a-positive, h3-positive specimens with the swine np gene pcr to screen for h3n2v. samples that are influenza-a positive, but negative in the initial subtyping assays are designated unsubtypeable, and are investigated further including other seasonal (n2, h1, n1, pdm09h1), swine (np) and avian (h5, h7, +/− h9) rrt-pcr subtyping targets using cdc protocols, in addition to an end-point swine influenza matrix (m) gene pcr developed by canada's national microbiology laboratory (nml). influenza-negative outbreak and icu samples are also tested using a nasopharyngeal swab from the case collected on september 10 tested positive for influenza a in viral culture, and specimens collected on september 12 and 15 during a bronchoalveolar lavage was also positive for influenza a in the mrvp assay. a subsequent nasopharyngeal swab collected on september 17 tested negative for influenza. the september 10 sample was initially unsubtypeable by the influenza a subtyping assays routinely used at phol -influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 na gene and seasonal ha3 gene. realtime subtyping pcrs for seasonal ha1, seasonal na1, seasonal na2, ha5, and ha7 were all negative. real-time pcrs for swine nucleoprotein (np) gene and a(h1n1)pdm09 ha1 gene were both positive, as was a pcr for swine m gene. these results suggested that the influenza a virus was of swine origin, and of h1 subtype.whole genome sequencing was commenced at phol, and sequence data shared with the national microbiology laboratory (nml), canada's reference laboratory. the nml received the primary sample and culture material for further investigation. at nml, testing was performed on the culture material, which was negative for seasonal h3n2, pandemic na, h3n2 variant (v), and h1n2v. antiviral susceptibility testing showed that the isolate was resistant to amantadine but sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir. complete sequencing analysis of pb1, pb2, pa, ha, na, and m genes on viral rna extracted from the first passage in rhesus monkey kidney cells revealed that all sequences are very similar (between 98.9 and 99.5%) to viruses that have been found in us swine in 2011 and 2012 ( table 2 ). the even lower nucleotide homology to a/california/7/2009 (h1n1)-like virus na gene (79.6%) is consistent with this virus not being detected by the phol in-house a(h1n1)pdm09 na gene real-time pcr due to several scattered mismatches in primer and probe binding sites. 6 comparison . antigenicity of the h1n1v isolate was examined using ferret antisera to a/california/7/09 by hi assay; it cross-reacted with an hi titer of 160 (reference hi titer is 640). this serological profile suggests close antigenic homology between a(h1n1)pdm09 and the h1n1v strain reported here. based on the testing results from phol and nml, we concluded that this patient was infected with an influenza a (h1n1)v virus (table 3) . and molecular characterization and the need for a representative selection of influenza viruses to have further molecular investigation by sequencing, which would ultimately detect any significant circulation of such variants. such infrastructure will also enable rapid detection of more virulent influenza viruses, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza a (h5n1). we also suggest that a representative sample of influenza viruses from a variety of settings (e.g. critical care, outbreak-related, community-based) be screened by molecular methods in order to detect variants. following the emergence of h3n2v infections in the us in 2011, phol does screen a selection of influenza a, subtype h3 specimens, with the swine np gene pcr to screen for h3n2v. however, the np gene pcr is positive in influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 as well as h1n1v, as both are of swine origin. in general, exposure and travel-related information is poorly completed on laboratory requisitions, and not consistently asked of patients presenting with influenza-like illness, particularly during influenza season, hence many variant cases would be missed. it is anticipated that finding a variant virus would be very rare, thus it is not essential to test all patients for both the ha and na genes of influenza a (h1n1)pdm09. however systematic sequencing, which is primarily conducted in order to detect changes in the influenza genome which could impact vaccine effectiveness, could optimize detection of variants. this work should be conducted by reference laboratories as part of influenza surveillance.there were no external sources of funding for this study.jonathan b. gubbay has received a research grant from glaxo-smithkline inc. to work on resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. in june 2010, public health ontario received a research grant from glaxosmithkline to study phenotypic resistance in the influenza virus.research ethics approval was not required.influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) and other respiratory viruses are the cause of substantial morbidity and mortality, with children under 5 years of age and the elderly disproportionately burdened [1] . both influenza and rsv display distinct seasonality, however, the exact timing and magnitude of their annual epidemics remain difficult to predict [2] . a better understanding of the epidemiology of these pathogens is useful for the prevention and control of future epidemics and for optimising clinical management of patients [3] . moreover, this knowledge may inform prediction models used to estimate the timing and magnitude of influenza epidemics [2] .interference between respiratory viruses has been well documented. during peaks of influenza epidemics, the spread of other respiratory viruses, particularly rsv, appears to be limited [4] [5] [6] . delays in outbreaks of influenza during the 2009 pandemic in europe were linked to the annual rhinovirus epidemic associated with the beginning of the school year [7] [8] [9] . in turn, the influenza pandemic was observed to interfere with seasonal epidemics of rsv in france [10] and israel [11] , rsv and metapneumovirus in germany [12] , seasonal influenza in hong kong [13] and all respiratory viruses except rhinovirus in beijing [14] . studies investigating viral interference since the pandemic are sparser, though two studies reported that the timing and magnitude of respiratory virus epidemics were affected by the timing of the seasonal influenza a peak [15, 16] . collectively, these observations suggest interference may prevent respiratory viruses reaching their epidemic peaks concurrently, but also underscore the complexity of these interactions.the exact nature of interactions between different respiratory viruses remains unclear, although they are proposed to be driven by the innate immune system. once a viral infection is established, interferon production is believed to confer temporary immunity to neighbouring cells against infection by other respiratory viruses [17] . in vitro, infection with rsv is blocked by competitive infection of influenza a if the host is not infected with the two viruses simultaneously [18] . similarly, ferret models have shown that influenza a infection may prevent successive infection with rsv [19] and that coinfection with different influenza subtypes is dependent upon the order in which the viruses infect the host [20] .despite this apparent interference, viral co-infections do occur, albeit with insufficient frequency to maintain an epidemic-level spread of the co-infecting viruses. a recent study reported infrequent co-detection of rhinovirus with other viruses [21] , despite observations that rhinovirus continues to be shed for several weeks postresolution of symptoms [22] . negative associations have also been observed between the detection of influenza a, rsv, parainfluenza virus or coronavirus and co-detection of other respiratory viruses [8, 23, 24] , providing further evidence for a refractory period after initial infection during which the host is less likely to be infected by subsequent exposure to another respiratory virus.we used routine diagnostic testing data of specimens from both the community and hospitals at the victorian infectious diseases reference laboratory (vidrl) between 2002 and 2017 to describe relationships between respiratory viruses, with a focus on influenza a and rsv.from may 2002 to december 2017, 58 114 clinical specimens were collected from communities and hospitals and tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for respiratory virus infection at vidrl. there were no inclusion criteria regarding symptoms, but it is assumed that testing was deemed clinically relevant. multiple specimen types were tested, but the majority were nose/throat swabs (64.2%) or nasopharyngeal aspirates (17.1%). the respiratory panel included nine viruses: adenovirus, influenza a, influenza b, parainfluenza virus, picornavirus (virus family includes rhinoviruses and enteroviruses), rsv, coronavirus (from 2010), human metapneumovirus (from 2012) and influenza c (from 2012). data were de-identified, but the date of birth, postcode of residence and sex of the patient were provided.data exclusions are shown in figure s1 . data from outbreaks, research and non-victorian residents were excluded (n = 10 325) as they followed different sampling methods. specimens collected from the same patient within 14 days were considered part of the same infection: where both specimens were positive for the same virus or both were negative, they were counted as one episode; where there were both positive and negative results, only the positive result was retained; and when two specimens were positive for different viruses, they were collapsed to represent one episode of co-detection. as a result, 8612 records were excluded. data from 2009 (n = 4232) were excluded as the influenza pandemic led to changes in referral and testing practices. data from 2016 to 2017 (n = 1293) were also excluded as the introduction of in-house testing at some referring hospitals led to a substantial decrease in samples tested by vidrl.demographic data of patients were compared using pearson's χ 2 test. weekly proportions positive for each virus were calculated to allow comparability and assess differences in virus epidemics between seasons. we compared our data to influenza notification rates in victoria obtained from the national notifiable diseases surveillance system (nndss) [25] to assess the representativeness of inter-seasonal peaks we observed. to assess timing and magnitude of epidemics, the proportion of positive specimens and the peak week of the epidemic were considered: those in the lowest quartile were considered early or small and those in the highest quartile were considered late or large. seasonality of viruses was assessed visually by time series analysis and for further investigation each virus was compared with influenza a and rsv using cross-correlations that estimated the association between peaks in epidemic curves at a lag or lead of up to 15 weeks.fisher's exact test was used to investigate any negative association between virus pairs among specimens with co-detections. multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for age category (<5, 5-19, 20-64 and ⩾65 years), sex and season, was used to produce odds ratios (or) and 95% confidence intervals for these associations and the chi-square test used to assess trend. adjustment for multiple comparisons was not performed [23, 26] . the significance level for all tests was set at p < 0.05.all data extraction, exclusion and analyses were performed in stata (version 14.2, statacorp, college station, texas).there were 33 652 pcr results from 2002 to 2015 (excluding 2009) included in this study. of these, 11 154 (33.1%) were positive for at least one of the nine viruses tested for (table 1) . picornavirus (rhinovirus) was detected most frequently (n = 5363, 33.1% of the positive specimens), followed by influenza a (n = 2259, 20.3%) and rsv (n = 1487, 13.3%). the proportion of tests positive for most viruses remained relatively stable (fig. 1) . however, there was a higher positivity rate of rsv pre-2009 (p < 0.001). the positivity rate of influenza a peaked and troughed; a year with a big epidemic was usually followed by a year with a smaller epidemic. of the influenza a-positive samples, 57.9% were a(h3n2), 23.7% were a(h1n1) and the remaining not subtyped. in most seasons, one subtype predominated, although in 2005 and 2014, the subtypes were observed to circulate with similar magnitude and timing and in 2013 they circulated as two distinct peaks of comparable magnitude. the rate of picornavirus detection increased from 2006 to 2010 and then decreased from 2011 to 2015 returning to a level similar to that observed at the beginning of the study period.more specimens tested were collected from males (53.9%) ( table 1) . as a proportion of total tests per sex, females were more likely to test positive for influenza a (p < 0.001) and metapneumovirus (p = 0.015), while males were more likely to test positive for picornavirus (p = 0.003) (table s1 ). there was no significant difference in sex distribution for the other viruses. patients residing in rural areas were significantly more likely to have a positive test than those in urban areas (p < 0.001). the same pattern was seen individually for rsv, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus. however, patients from urban areas were more likely to test positive for influenza a and metapneumovirus. associations between remaining viruses and area of residence were not significant.respiratory virus tests were most frequently requested in winter (june-august; n = 11 750, 34.9%) ( table 1 ) and were most likely to be positive in winter (p < 0.001). six of the nine viruses were most frequently detected in winter, but parainfluenza virus and metapneumovirus were most frequent in spring (september-november) and picornavirus was most frequent in autumn (march-may). tests positive for picornavirus were distributed relatively evenly across the seasons, so although the modal week was in autumn, a peak was less distinct compared to other viruses.the median age of positive tests was lower than that for all tests (36.9 (iqr: 2.4-61.5) and 45.3 (22.6-64.3) years, table 1 . demographic and temporal information for included specimens (table s1 ). notably, the median age of patients from whom specimens were collected increased fairly steadily from 27.6 years in 2002 to 61 years in 2015 (table s2) .time series analysis demonstrated annual seasonal peaks for influenza a and rsv (fig. 1) . peaks occurred most frequently in winter, with occasional peaks in late autumn (rsv) and early spring (influenza a). although influenza a virus circulation during summer in victoria is expected to be minimal, we observed increased influenza positivity rates in many summers during the study period, one of which was larger than its preceding winter peak (2013-2014). these inter-epidemic peaks were reflected in victorian notification rates (obtained from nndss) in summers from 2010 to 2011 onwards, visible as influenza activity not reaching zero as it had in previous summers (fig. 2) . seasonal peaks were also observed among the other viruses, except picornavirus, although they did not occur every year. picornavirus remained endemic throughout the year for the duration of the study period. cross-correlations were performed to ascertain whether the timing and magnitude of other viruses may differ relative to influenza a activity. results revealed a moderate to strong correlation between epidemic curves of influenza and rsv in 9 of 13 years. on average, where correlated, a seasonal epidemic of rsv occurred 6 weeks earlier than that of influenza a (table 2) , although there were 3 years where the epidemics occurred at similar times (2002, 2005 and 2006) . as a sensitivity analysis, we performed further cross-correlations to assess whether influenza subtype affected these interactions (table s3 ). the lag calculated for influenza a overall was consistently similar to that of the predominant influenza a subtype in a given season. in some years the lag calculated suggested influenza a(h1n1) circulated prior to rsv, however in these years the number of samples positive for influenza a(h1n1) was <10.no consistent pattern emerged when considering timing and magnitude of influenza a and rsv seasons ( table 2) : an early epidemic of one virus sometimes resulted in a later than usual epidemic of the other, but this was not always the case. likewise, a season with a high magnitude of infections with one virus did not necessarily result in a season with a low magnitude of the other. generally, influenza b epidemics occurred at a similar time to influenza a and in years that influenza a circulated early (2002, 2005, 2011, 2012) , influenza b activity was low (data not shown).co-detections of respiratory viruses occurred in 6.4% (n = 823) of positive samples. exploratory data analysis using univariate logistic regression suggested co-detections were more likely to occur in children under 5 years, males and during winter. odds of co-detection decreased as age increased. using the <5 year age group as the reference category, the ors (adjusted for sex and season) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for co-infection co-detections occurred most frequently with adenovirus (40%), influenza c (39%) and coronavirus (20%), though the number of influenza c infections was small (n = 18) (fig. 3) . co-detections were rarest with picornavirus (10%) and influenza a and b (6%) infections. analysis of co-infections using fisher's exact test found a pattern of a negative association between detection of influenza a, rsv or picornavirus and co-detection of another virus (table 3) . these three viruses were involved in the highest number of significant negative associations (n = 5, table 3 ). no positive associations between viruses were considered statistically significant. multivariate logistic regression (adjusted for age group, sex and season) was used to further investigate the probability of co-detection given infection with influenza a, rsv and picornavirus (table 4 ). significant negative associations were observed for co-detection with all viruses where influenza a was detected and all but one virus for rsv and picornavirus detections (influenza b and human metapneumovirus, respectively).we used multi-year routine pcr testing data to establish patterns of respiratory virus circulation in victoria, australia. picornavirus (rhinovirus) was most frequently detected. children aged <5 years and those living in rural areas experienced a high burden of infection. time series analyses indicated the annual occurrence of epidemics for influenza a and rsv and less recurrent epidemics for influenza b, coronavirus and parainfluenza virus. picornavirus was observed to be endemic throughout the period of analysis. rsv epidemics generally began in autumn and peaked early winter, while influenza a began mid-winter and peaked late winter. the higher incidence of rsv observed pre-2009 may be a result for timing and magnitude of epidemic curves, proportion of specimens positive and the peak week of the epidemic were considered: those in the highest quartile were considered late or large; those in the lowest quartile were considered early or small.of the higher proportion of children under 5 years in our sample pre-2009, as rsv is considered the most important respiratory illness-causing pathogen in infants [27] . we observed summer peaks of influenza a in some years which was somewhat unexpected in a temperate climate but was only reflected in state-wide notification data after 2009. it is possible that inter-epidemic peaks we observed are a result of denominator data, while the increase in notifications resulted from a rise in testing after the 2009 pandemic [28] . in years that epidemics occurred, influenza b, coronavirus and parainfluenza virus peaked in winter and metapneumovirus in spring. like previous studies [15, 16] , time series analyses and crosscorrelations established distinct circulation patterns of rsv and influenza a. the two viruses rarely reached their epidemic peak concurrently, with rsv peaking an average of 6 weeks before influenza a. influenza a subtype did not affect cross-correlations: in seasons where significant correlation was observed, the lag calculated for influenza a overall was similar to that of the predominant subtype. in some seasons, influenza a(h1n1) appeared to circulate prior to rsv. however, in these seasons the number of a(h1n1) positive samples was <10, so the results should be interpreted with caution. an investigation into seasonal relationships between epidemic curves of other viruses was limited by the small proportion of positive tests. the endemic nature of picornavirus appeared to be unaffected by the circulation of other respiratory viruses, which supports previous observations of rhinovirus activity (most common species of picornavirus) [15, 16] . this may be a result of increased stability of the non-enveloped picornavirus during warmer months compared to other viruses, like influenza, which are restricted by temperature and humidity [29] .we also investigated the distribution and incidence of respiratory virus co-detection. improved availability and sensitivity of diagnostic tests has resulted in more regular detection of co-infections [30] , though the impact of viral co-infection on clinical severity remains unclear [31, 32] . a prospective household transmission study during the 2009 influenza pandemic reported that the infection wave caused by influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 was interrupted by a wave of non-influenza respiratory virus infections [33] . it found individuals infected with influenza a (h1n1)pdm09 were less likely to be infected by non-influenza respiratory viruses than non-infected individuals (rr: 0.32). further, there was a significant decrease in the duration of viral shedding in co-infections (of any respiratory viruses) compared to single infections. these observations suggest that such interactions may modulate influenza attack rate during outbreaks, thus shaping the epidemic and highlighting the importance of better understanding co-infections in the context of viral interference.we found co-detections of respiratory viruses in 6.4% of positive specimens, which falls in the 5.0-62.0% range of previous studies [31] . like other studies, we found co-infection was less likely with increasing age [34, 35] , which may be a consequence of pre-existing immunity or decreased viral shedding with increasing age [30] . we found adenovirus and coronavirus most likely to be part of a co-infection and influenza a and b least likely, corroborating results of a previous study [36] . while our data did not include patients' symptoms, immunological [37] and clinical [24, 38] data suggest that the effect of co-infection on clinical severity depends on the specific pathogens co-infecting the patient.infection by rhinovirus may result in temporary immunity of the host to infection by other respiratory viruses due to the production of cytokines [17] , thus resulting in a negative association between rhinovirus infection and co-infection with another virus [23] . moreover, it is believed to be the driver of epidemiological interaction between respiratory viruses at the population level, which is visible when two viruses may not reach their epidemic peak during the same period. while rhinovirus has been the focus of other studies investigating co-detection, we found that influenza a, rsv and picornavirus all had significant negative associations with co-detection of other viruses. results of further investigation by logistic regression adjusted for covariates that are predictors of codetection (sex, age and season) were compatible with influenza a, rsv and picornavirus conferring temporary immunity against infection by another respiratory virus. however, we cannot make causal inferences from the design used and therefore, cannot eliminate the role of other environmental factors.our study has some limitations. all inferences we made and indeed the majority of inferences made in other studies investigating respiratory virus interference are based on ecological data. with such data, we cannot determine whether events observed are the result of a biological mechanism, nor can we infer the direction of the postulated interaction, i.e. which virus impacts which. to make any form of causal inference, a prospective study that serially samples participants over multiple respiratory virus epidemics would be required. furthermore, we did not adjust for other potential drivers of viral interference, such as environmental (e.g. temperature, humidity), social and behavioural factors. also, we cannot rule out the possibility that our observations were the result of surveillance artefacts, that is, changes in testing patterns that are not a result of genuine fluctuations in viral circulation. while we excluded specimens isolated from outbreaks or for surveillance and samples from 2009 and 2016-2017 when testing patterns were obviously altered, we cannot be certain we controlled completely for this unknown. type/ subtype data for other viruses may have also improved the resolution of our findings, as other studies have noted variances in the timing of epidemics caused by different types of parainfluenza virus [4, 6] and rhinovirus [21] and there is scant information available for rsv. additionally, our study sample was drawn from patients ill enough to seek healthcare. as some viruses (such as picornavirus) are more likely to result in asymptomatic associations considered significant are bolded. the top cell represents the p-value for each measure of association and the bottom cell the or (and corresponding 95% ci) for infection. a no co-detections with these two viruses occurred infection than others, the distribution of viruses in our sample may differ from that in the population. finally, the referral base of paediatric samples for vidrl is limited as most victorian paediatric samples are forwarded to a children's hospital. given there is a high burden of respiratory virus infection in children, this may have limited our analyses. a strength of our data is that it spanned 16 years. accurately monitoring seasonal variation in respiratory virus epidemics has the potential to improve our understanding of interaction and interference between different respiratory viruses, although this remains challenging as surveillance systems for non-influenza respiratory viruses are limited in both scope and funding. our study confirms the existence of temporal relationships in the circulation of some respiratory viruses in victoria and provides further evidence to support the postulated effects of viral interference on magnitude and timing of respiratory virus epidemics. hemagglutinin (ha) and 9 neuraminidase (na) subtypes [1] . influenza b viruses are not subtyped. historically, only three ha subtypes, h1, h2 and h3, have been responsible for pandemic outbreaks. this includes the 2009 outbreak caused by a novel influenza a (h1n1) virus of swine origin [2] . in contrast, all virus subtypes and combinatorial possibilities of ha and na have been detected in wild birds and poultry [3] . since 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) viruses, in particular the h5n1 subtype, have jumped the species barrier and caused ongoing sporadic fatal outbreaks in humans [4] . therefore, the looming threat of pandemics from influenza viruses cannot be overlooked, and assays that enable rapid, accurate identification and subtyping of influenza viruses is pertinent for surveillance and outbreak management.the increasing popularity of chip-based dna microarrays reflects their tremendous diagnostic potential and utility for rapid detection and subtyping of influenza viruses [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . of late, a handful of respiratory virus microarrays have been produced commercially, such as the infiniti ò flu a-sh1n1 quad assay (autogenomics, inc., carlsbad, ca), the fluchip (indevr, boulder, co) and the fda-cleared vrnat assay (verigene ò , northbrook, il). the last of these is designed to detect influenza a and b viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses a and b using a glass slide array. the infiniti ò flu a-sh1n1 quad assay and the fluchip assays are, however, still for research use only.in our study, we describe the development and validation of the vereflu tm assay, which, to our knowledge, is the first commercially available integrated lab-on-chip (loc) device that combines reverse transcription (rt)-pcr amplification followed by amplicon hybridization to a dna microarray for the specific detection of clinically important influenza virus subtypes, including the 2009 pandemic influenza (h1n1) and h5n1 viruses.vereflu tm assay -system overview the hardware that is required to run the chips comprises a computer, a thermal control system (tcs), which enables pcr thermal cycling, and a microarray optical reader (lean s.r.l., medolla, italy). the accompanying software controls the instrumentation and also generates the analysis report. the workflow of the system and the processing time of each step is listed below.1. extraction of viral rna (vrna) from the sample.this can be done either manually using spin-columns or using automated extraction systems (*45 min). . the sequences were aligned using the bioedit sequence alignment editor version 7.0.5.3, and highly conserved regions resulting from the alignment were used for probe and primer design. as shown in table 1 , ha-specific primers were designed for pandemic and seasonal h1n1, h3n2, h5n1 and influenza b viruses. additional primers and probes were designed against the na segments of pandemic h1n1 and h5n1 to facilitate subtyping. reverse primers were synthesized with the addition of a 5 0 -terminal cy5 label (sigma proligo, singapore). the capture probes were designed using the variable regions of the genes ( table 1 ). the assay comprised 14 influenza-virus-specific pcr primers and a set of forward and reverse psii primers for the amplification of a pcr-positive control of plant origin (table 1) . together, these primers constituted the vereflu tm primer mix a. there were 23 influenza targeted capture probes, 2 rt-pcr control probes, and positive and negative hybridization control probes (table 1) .singapore a total of 277 respiratory samples (throat and nasal swabs) were collected from patients presenting influenza-like illness with fever c38°c, cough, sore throat, headache and muscle ache. the samples were collected from may 2008 to august 2009 by sentinel physicians participating in a local influenza surveillance programme. the specimens were transported from their site of collection to the national public health laboratory (nphl), singapore, where sample processing was carried out. all specimens were subjected to influenza virus detection by real-time rt-pcr and shellvial culture followed by immunofluorescence (if) assay. swabs taken from patients using flocked swabs (copan diagnostics, murrieta, ca) were transported in 3 ml of copan universal transport medium (utm). utm specimens were divided into two aliquots. one aliquot was used for viral culture using standard shell vial technique and the other was subject to nucleic acid extraction using an ez1 biorobot (qiagen, hilden, germany). extracted rna was eluted in 60 ll of buffer, and the nucleic acid samples were stored at -80°c until required for pcr analysis.real-time rt-pcr detection of influenza a virus has been described by spackman and colleagues [12] . samples that were positive for influenza a virus were further subtyped into h1 or h3 using the protocol described by the public health laboratory services branch, centre for health protection (chp), department of health, hong kong sar, china (http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/ chp_protocols_for_the_detection_of_human_swine_ influenza.pdf). the detection of pandemic influenza a (h1n1) 2009 was based on the nucleoprotein (np) gene, using primers and probes designed by the nphl. the detection of influenza b virus has been described by krafft et al. [13] . all rt-pcrs reactions were set up using quantitect probe pcr kits (qiagen) with the amplification performed on a lightcycler 2.0 real-time pcr system (roche, mannheim, germany). pcr protocols, primer and probe sequences are available upon request from the authors.for the isolation of influenza virus, the aliquoted specimen in transport medium was passed through a 0.22-lm acrodisc syringe filter (pall corp., ann arbor, mi) and inoculated into a shell vial (diagnostic hybrids, inc., columbus, oh) containing a monolayer of madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) cells. after two days of incubation at 37°c, the direct if test using fluorescein-isothiocyanateconjugated (fitc) monoclonal antibodies (light diagnostics, concord road, billerica, ma) specific for influenza a and b viruses was used to detect and differentiate between the viruses. a zeiss inverted fluorescent microscope was used to examine the samples for positively staining cells. influenza-virus-positive cultures were stored at -80°c for future use.virus isolates in mdck cell culture and clinical specimens of influenza a virus, including pandemic influenza a (h1n1) virus, were submitted to the who collaborating centre for reference and research on influenza at victorian infectious diseases reference laboratory (vidrl) from who national influenza centres, regional laboratories and hospitals from australia, new zealand, and the asia/pacific region. viruses were grown in mdck cells and/or embryonated chicken eggs [14] . virus growth was monitored by observing cytopathic effect, and the presence of haemagglutination activity was observed using turkey red blood cells as described previously [14] . the isolates were tested using a standard haemagglutination inhibition assay (hai) against a panel of reference viruses and their homologous ferret antisera [14] . vrna was extracted from either clinical specimens or from viruses grown in mdck cell cultures as described previously [15] . real-time rt-pcr was also performed to determine the type and subtype of viruses from clinical specimens as described previously [14] .vereflu tm assay pcr amplificationthe multiplex rt-pcr reaction was performed using a quantitect virus?rox vial kit (qiagen, ontario, canada) in a total volume of 25 ll. the rt-pcr master mix was prepared by adding the following components: 5 ll of 5x qt virus nr master mix, 1 ll of vereflu tm primer mix a, 3 ll of rnase-free water, 0.5 ll of rnase inhibitor (20 u/ll), 0.5 ll of qt virus rt mix, 10 ll of the rna template and 5 ll of psii amplification control. psii is in vitrotranscribed rna derived from the chloroplast-encoded gene psba from a mungbean plant (genbank: gq89302). the rt-pcr mix was pipetted into chip inlets leading to the pcr micro-reactor where amplification takes place. the chip was sealed and placed into the tcs. the cycling parameters used were as follows: 15 min at 50°c; 5 min at 95°c; 45 cycles of 15 sec at 95°c, 30 sec at 50°c and 45 sec at 72°c.upon completion of rt-pcr, the chip was extracted from the tcs and unsealed. for hybridization of amplicons to the microarray, 14.5 ll of hybridization mix was pipetted into the chip inlets such that the final buffer composition was 1 mm phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm kcl, 500 mm nacl, 1x denhardt's solution, 0.05 % tween 20 and 0.5 nm each of the positive hybridization controls at730, at776, at683 ( table 1 ). the chip was re-sealed and placed into the tcs. heat denaturation of amplicons was performed at 2 min at 95°c, followed by a 30-min hybridization at 55°c. after the hybridization, the chips were unsealed and washed for 2 min at room temperature in falcon tubes filled with 50 ml of 0.3x ssc/0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate and dried by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 min in a 50-ml falcon tube. the dried chip was scanned in an optical reader (lean s.r.l.). spot segmentation and intensity calculation of the microarray image was performed by overlaying a virtual grid over the microarray image using the corner features as reference points. spot images detected within the grid were computed for background and signal values [16] . a signal-to-noise ratio of [3.0 was defined as a positive result.recombinant plasmids bearing synthetic 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) ha and na genes with t7 promoter sequences at their 5' ends were obtained from integrated dna technology, inc. (idt inc, coralville, ia). recombinant plasmids bearing ha and na genes from clinical isolates of influenza a h1n1, h3n2 and influenza b (atcc vr01535) viruses were generated in-house. the plasmids were linearized by restriction digestion using sali (new england biolabs inc, ipswich, ma) for the na gene and sacii (promega, madison, wi) for the ha gene. in vitro transcripts (ivts) were generated using riboprobe ò in vitro transcription system (promega) and quantified using an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer rna 6000 nano kit (agilent technology, santa clara, ca).ivts of ha and na gene segments from clinical isolates of influenza a h1n1 and h3n2 viruses and an atcc isolate of influenza b virus (vr01535) were used for the determination of analytical sensitivity. the rna concentration was measured using a nanodrop nd-1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies, wilmington, de). the rna copy number was calculated using the following formula: rna concentration [x g/ll rna] / (transcript length [bp] x 340) x 6.022 x 10 23 , and tenfold serial dilutions of the ha and na rna transcripts were made. the lod and cutoff values were determined in triplicate for the rna transcripts. the lod was the lowest concentration of rna that could give a 95% detection rate for that virus type for all triplicates. the cutoff value for detection was defined as the lowest rna concentration that would yield a positive assay result 50% of the time.the analytical specificity of the vereflu tm assay was evaluated using a panel of nine commonly found noninfluenza respiratory viruses purchased from the american type culture clinical samples were subjected to nucleic acid extraction using an ez1 biorobot (qiagen), and 10 ll of the extracted nucleic acid was used in each vereflu tm assay reaction. the evaluations were carried out at three local hospitals, and the results were collated and presented as a single table (table 3) .quantified viral stocks of influenza a (h3n2) virus, influenza b virus and negative samples were used for assessing intra-assay and inter-assay reproducibility. low, moderate and strong positives were prepared from influenza a (h3n2) and influenza b virus rna. the ct values for h3n2 low, moderate and strong positive samples were 33, 31 and 24, respectively, whilst the ct values for influenza b low, moderate and strong positive samples were 28, 26, and 20, respectively. lod and cutoff rna copy number concentrations provided the basis for low and medium positives. testing was carried out at each concentration using 30 influenza virus samples in triplicate and 10 negative samples also in triplicate. studies were conducted with two runs per day, at two local test sites by two operators, over a test period of 5 days. the percentage of agreement with the expected result was calculated.the sensitivity and specificity of the vereflu tm assay were calculated by comparison to a combination of reference methods, which included rt-pcr, sequencing of the ha segment, virus culture and immunoassays. for sensitivity and specificity results, the 95% confidence interval ci for a proportion was calculated using the wilson score method without continuity correction [17] .the lod is defined as the rna concentration that would yield a positive assay result 95% of the time. for all the virus types tested, the lod was determined to be 10 2 copies/reaction ( table 2 ). the cutoff detection was defined as the rna copy number that could be detected 50% of the time, and this was determined to be 50 copies for both influenza a (h3n2) virus and influenza b virus. for pandemic and seasonal h1n1, the cutoff was determined to be not higher than 2 9 10 2 copies/reaction.the vereflu tm assay was tested with a panel of 9 noninfluenza viruses, 3 different influenza a virus subtypes (h1n1, h3n2, h5n1) and influenza b virus. no crossreaction was observed with the influenza viruses tested. with the non-influenza respiratory viruses, cross-reactions were noted for the 2009 pandemic influenza capture probe with human coronavirus oc43 and influenza b capture probes with human adenovirus type 7. these were considered minor cross-reactions, as their probe signalto-noise ratios were weakly positive. also, in both cases, only one of the triplicate samples was positive. hence, the overall analytical specificity for the vereflu tm assay was calculated to be 96%.clinical evaluation of the vereflu tm assay, singaporethe vereflu tm assay was validated at three sites in singapore using a total of 277 respiratory samples ( table 3) . the assay showed good sensitivity ([91%) and excellent specificity (100%) for all the influenza viruses tested.evaluation of the vereflu tm assay at who, melbournethe system was evaluated using clinical and cell-cultured virus samples. additionally, avian influenza a (h5n1) virus testing was also performed. overall, out of the 44 samples tested, the vereflu tm assay results for 40 specimens (91%) were concordant with the reference methods. all (n = 4) influenza-negative samples tested negative.specifically, the vereflu tm assay detected the influenza viruses in positive samples as follows: 10/12 (83.3%) for pandemic h1n1, 3/3 (100%) for seasonal h1n1, 2/2 (100%) for h5n1, 7/9 (77.7%) for h3n2 and 18/18 (100%) for influenza b. observations by the research investigators indicated that the assay was able to detect both lineages of influenza b viruses (yamagata and victoria lineages) and influenza a viruses of different clades, including h5n1.the reproducibility of the vereflu tm assay is presented in table 4 . when tested at rna copy numbers that would give moderate and strong positives for h3n2 and influenza b, the assays were highly reproducible ([91%). as expected, when seasonal influenza a (h1n1) 8 9 10 2 2 9 10 2 influenza a (h3n2) 1 9 10 2 5 9 10 1 influenza b 1 9 10 2 5 9 10 1 low rna copy numbers were tested, the reproducibility dropped to almost 50% for h3n2 and 70% for influenza b.here, we report the development and evaluation of a portable and easy-to-use diagnostic platform, the vereflu tm assay, for the typing and subtyping of human influenza virus. the test is based on an on-chip multiplex rt-pcr amplification followed by detection using a microarray, and it can be performed fairly rapidly, taking about 3 h to complete. each tcs or thermal reactor accommodates a maximum of five chips, which can be run either simultaneously or independently using different protocols. the modular nature of the system allows the linkup of more than one tcs unit to the computer, hence enabling the system to be adapted to the throughput needs of either large-or small-scale diagnostic settings. laboratory reproducibility data from our study suggest that the assay is easy to handle, which is an important consideration during outbreak situations. the overall clinical sensitivity for all influenza a viruses tested was 94.3%, and the specificity was 96.8%. these values were comparable to those obtained in similar microarray based influenza virus typing assays [18, 19] . it is known that microarray-based detection and typing of influenza viruses is generally less sensitive than performing a real-time pcr [9, 19] . our analytical sensitivity was determined to be 10 2 copies/reaction for each influenza type. these figures are similar to those reported by huang et al. [9] , at 10 2 rna copies/reaction for seasonal h3n2, h1n1, h5n1 and influenza b virus. the detection limit for a multiplex pcr assay has been reported to be 50 copies for influenza a and influenza b viruses [20] , which explains why some of the samples that were typed and confirmed by the reference methods of cell culture and real-time rt pcr were missed by the vereflu tm assay.in our laboratory, we use real-time pcr to detect influenza a virus and then follow up with a second subtyping pcr when influenza a positives are detected. we anticipate that the vereflu tm assay will ease that process, since detection and subtyping is done simultaneously onchip. multiplexing capabilities of real-time pcr reactions are typically limited to a fourplex as restricted by the number of fluorescence acquisition channels present in the pcr instrument. in contrast, the detection format in the vereflu tm assay is low-density-array-based, allowing tens to hundreds of capture probes to be spotted and correspondingly allowing a similar number of amplicons to be detected. hence, the arrays have a much greater detection capability for robust parallel testing than real-time pcr.given the high mutational frequency of influenza virus genomes [21] efforts taken to increase the specificity of the vereflu tm assay included the use of short capture probes of 21 to 28 nucleotides [22] as well as the incorporation of probe redundancy. the capture probes were designed to detect between 2 and 4 sections of the targeted gene and may be useful in overcoming the problem of misdiagnosis due to capture probes failing to hybridize with the amplicon as a result of gene polymorphisms. in our assay, capture probe cross-reactions were observed for the 2009 pandemic influenza a (h1n1) probe with human coronavirus oc43 and the influenza b capture probe with human adenovirus type 7. during the testing of clinical samples, false positives of this nature will be unlikely, as hybridization to only one capture probe (instead of both probes for influenza b virus or all three probes for 2009 pandemic h1n1) is insufficient to permit the vereflu tm software to call a positive result. instead, the operator will be alerted that the particular influenza gene segment has been detected, and a re-test will be advised. we are working on applying a more stringent hybridization wash, which may solve the problem of cross-reactions.in summary, we have developed a lab-on-chip device that has been clinically evaluated both locally and at who, melbourne. the system was found to be reliable and accurate for the identification of clinically significant influenza viruses and could potentially prove to be a valuable method for routine influenza surveillance as well as outbreak events.it is becoming increasingly clear that understanding the components of disease processes, particularly infectious disease, will be critical for understanding the survival or demise of free ranging mammalian species. genomic variation of both host species and infectious agent is of critical importance in the outcome of a disease outbreak, and even more so in endangered species. species with reduced genetic variation, particularly in genes involved with disease resistance, may be less able to mount an effective immune response against an emerging pathogen. representing carnivores, the cat family felidae offers numerous examples of reduced genetic var-iation in natural populations common to endangered species including asian lion (panthera leo persica) (gilbert et al., 1991) , cheetah (acinonyx jubatus) (menotti-raymond and o'brien, 1993) , tiger (p. tigris) (luo et al., 2004) , leopard (p. pardus) (uphyrkina et al., 2001; uphyrkina et al., 2002) and the north american populations of puma (puma concolor) (culver et al., 2000; roelke et al., 1993) that may signify increased susceptibility to opportunistic infectious disease. in addition, the pathogens themselves evolve, constantly developing new genetic based strategies to overcome or abrogate the immune defenses of the host species. the consequence of the co-evolution of pathogen and host are a dynamic ratchet of constantly improving virulence of the agent and resistance of 0006-3207/$ -see front matter ó 2006 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.biocon.2006.05.001 the host. both the pathogens and the host are survivors of ancient deadly struggles and the exquisite strategies that have been retained are only now being deciphered.conservation management of endangered carnivores has limited opportunities to detect, monitor and contain emergent pathogens due to logistic concerns involved with the continued monitoring of the health status of natural populations. as a result, we know most about disease processes in humans, homo sapiens (garrett, 1994) , so understanding human-pathogen interactions can help us correctly interpret examples from wildlife. there are far more people and more human medical researchers than there are for most large charismatic mammals, so more human disease outbreaks have been tracked. tools of molecular biology, genetics, immunology and epidemiology were developed with human disease in mind, but they work very well in other mammals. thus, efforts in characterizing the genetics, evolution, and pattern of transmission of pathogens, and the resultant conservation implications for the host species, benefit directly from advances in human genomic research.one of the most significant advances in the genomics era integral to conservation genetics is the whole genome sequence of a score of mammals. starting with human, mouse, rat, and chimp, these projects now capture the phylogenetic divergence across all the orders of placental mammals by inclusion of dog, cat, elephant, cow and others (nhgri website: www.genome.gov). further, a subset of orthologous genes sequenced in representatives of 5400 species determined conclusively the evolutionary pattern of divergence of placental mammals during the last 105 my (murphy et al., 2001a; murphy et al., 2004; murphy et al., 2001b; o'brien et al., 1999a) . the utility of the mammalian phylogeny in conservation ranges from defining taxonomic units to using the evolutionary tree as a reference guide to detect patterns of mutation, adaptation, and selection in endangered species. for example, whole genome sequences of human, chimpanzee (pan troglodytes), mouse (mus musculus) and dog (canis familiaris) indicate that not only do genomes evolve at different rates (cooper et al., 2004) , but also categories of genes experience different regimes of selection to either diversify or maintain function among primates, rodents and carni- a  t  u  c  o  r  c  a  t  u  c  o  r  c  a  n  e  a  y  h  d  e  t  t  o  p  s  a  l  u  v  r  a  p  e  l  a  g  o  l  e  h  e  s  o  o  g  n  o  m  f  r  a  w  d  s  a  t  t  a  c  i  r  u  s  a  t  a  c  i  r  u  e  t  a  c  i  r  u  s  x  o  r  e  f  a  t  c  o  r  p  o  t  p  y  r  c  a  s  s  o  f  s  u  t  i  d  o  r  h  p  a  m  r  e  h  s  u  r  u  x  o  d  a  r  a  p  t  e  v  i  c  m  l  a  p  a  t  t  e  n  e  g  a  t  t  e  n  n  e  g  t  e  n t  a  c  d  l  i  w  n  a  e  p  o  r  u  e  t  a  c  d  l  i  w  n  a  c  i  r  f  a  t  a  c  t  r  e  s  e  d  e  s  e  n  i  h  c  t  a  c  d  n  a  s  t  a  c  d  e  t  o  o  f  -k  c  a  l  b  t  a  c  e  l  g  n  u  j  t  a  c  s  a  l  l  a  p  t  a  c  d  e  t  t  o  p  s  -y  t  s  u  r  t  a  c  d  r  a  p  o  e  l  n  a  i  s  a  t  a  c  g  n  i  h  s  i  f  t  a  c  d  e  d  a  e  h  -t  a  l  f  a  m  u  p  i  d  n  u  o  r  a  u  g  a  j  h  a  t  e  e  h  c  x  n  y  l  n  a  i  r  e  b  i  x  n  y  l  n  a  i  s  a  r  u  e  x  n  y  l  n  a  i  d  a  n  a  c  t  a  c  b  o  b  t  o  l  e  c  o  y  a  g  r  a  m  t  a  c  n  i  a  t  n  u  o  m  n  a  e  d  n  a  t  a  c  s  a  p  m johnson et al., 2006 . shown is the maximum likelihood tree using the gtr +i model of sequence evolution from 18,853 bp of data from autosome, x and y linked genes. terminal nodes are labelled with three-letter codes, scientific name, common name and grouped in to eight major lineages within felidae.vores. in addition, human and chimpanzee, separated by only 5-7 my of evolution (enard and paabo, 2004 ) exhibit profound differences in chromosome recombination (winckler et al., 2005) , gene expression (hill and walsh, 2005) and differential selection for biological function (clark et al., 2003) . further, adaptive evolution of genes involved with the immune response to infectious disease can be estimated only by comparison across species. for example, the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) is a large multi-gene complex responsible for adaptive immune response in mammals and is integral to host resistance to emerging pathogens (kumanovics et al., 2003) . whole genome sequence of mhc reveals differences in gene composition, gene order and putative gene function between primates, rodents and carnivores (belov et al., 2004; kumanovics et al., 2003; yuhki et al., 2003) . thus, conservation genetic strategies for targeting informative genes benefit from a wealth of sequence data defining unique differences for these gene families among taxonomic groups.our ongoing research into host-pathogen interactions in the cat family felidae offers additional insights on how the application of molecular genomic technologies to non-human animal species not traditionally studied in research laboratories holds real promise in conservation. there are 38 species of felids nearly all of which are listed as threatened or near threatened with extinction (www.iucnredlist.org). recently, we have defined the pattern of divergence of the eight major lineages of cats from a common origin in asia and a series of global migration events over the past 10 my (johnson et al., 2006) (fig. 1 ) which provides an important evolutionary context for the analysis of host-pathogen adaptation. in the following, we illustrate how our investigations into the genomic, evolutionary and population studies of endangered cats species reviewed in o'brien and uncovered feline disease that resembled those in human and vice versa. the first involves the sars epidemic that devastated human populations in east asia in 2003 and a parallel outbreak in the cheetah (a. jubatus) years before (pearks wilkerson et al., 2004) . the second focuses on the lentivirus genus, which a generation ago (korber et al., 2000) leapt from chimpanzee to humans-likely through the bush meat trade in western africa sharp et al., 1999; sharp et al., 2005) , and precipitated perhaps the most deadly scourge in recorded history, hiv-aids . the cat family felidae is afflicted with a close relative of hiv, feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv). in domestic cat felis catus, fiv infection results in disease progression and outcome similarly to that of hiv in humans, and offers a natural model to aids (bendinelli et al., 1995) . here, we compare and contrast fiv genetics among additional cat species to yield new perspectives on host-pathogen adaptation.the impact of emerging pathogens in felids in these cases provides a cautionary tale of the importance of disease outbreaks in free-ranging species. the unpredictable nature of these outbreaks argues for conservation management strategies to guard against the introduction of disease by domestic animals or introduction of infected individuals into naïve populations. however, these cases show how in humans, rapid genetic and genomic characterization of both pathogen and host has been effective in development of treatment, intervention, and therapy, and offers a paradigm for disease research in conservation of endangered species.sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) first appeared as a flu-like disease caused by a new human coronavirus in guangdong province in southern china (drazen, 2003; drosten et al., 2003; holmes, 2003) . in the space of nine months the virus traveled to 29 countries, infected over 8000 people, and caused nearly 800 deaths (cdc, 2004) . the virus spread with alarming speed among health care workers, through casual contacts, and across the globe, causing human suffering and huge economic costs. published reports indicate a virus phylogenetically close to the sars virus was discovered in samples collected in chinese food markets from himalayan palm civets paguma lavarta (guan et al., 2003) . further screening of wildlife has now identified one or more species of bat as the presumptive host reservoir for sars-like coronaviruses (sl-cov); li et al., 2005; poon et al., 2005) . the epidemic subsided by may 2003, presumably consequent of draconian quarantine measures. there is still little clear understanding of the precise mode of transmission, and while there are promising advances in research of sars protease inhibitors (savarino, 2005; wei et al., 2006) there is still no vaccine or efficacious treatment for infected patients.the sars outbreak caught many by surprise, since human coronaviruses are well known as the cause of one third of common colds and are rarely deadly. further, veterinary virologists have commonly studied coronaviruses in livestock, dogs, cats and poultry and find these viruses seldom cause fatal diseases (holmes, 2003) . however, exceptions have occurred, for example in pigs, where a single nucleotide variant of porcine coronavirus leads to virulent pathogenic enteric coronavirus (ballesteros et al., 1997; sanchez et al., 1999) . the second exception involved a devastating feline coronavirus outbreak in cheetahs a. jubatus documented in a wild animal park, wildlife safari, in rural winston, oregon (heeney et al., 1990; o'brien et al., 1985) .wildlife safari was then the most prolific a. jubatus breeding facility in the world, holding some 60 cheetahs. in may 1982, two young cheetahs arrived from the sacramento zoo in california and rapidly developed symptoms of fever, severe diarrhea, jaundice, and neurological spasms. both died and were diagnosed at necropsy with the wet form of feline infectious peritonitis (fip) a disease caused by feline coronavirus in domestic cats (heeney et al., 1990) . within six months, every cheetah in the park developed antibodies to the fip virus (fipv), and exhibited diarrhea, jaundice, weight loss, gingivitis, and renal and hepatic pathology (fig. 2) . within two years 60% of the cheetahs had died of fip (evermann et al., 1988; heeney et al., 1990) . to our knowledge, this was the worst outbreak of fip in any cat species. in reported domestic cat outbreaks, mortality seldom exceeds 5% (foley et al., 1997) .the winston fip outbreak preceded pcr and advanced molecular phylogenetic methods, but when sars appeared in 2003, archival specimens were revisited to characterize the nature of the cheetah coronavirus (pearks wilkerson et al., 2004) . sequences of three viral genes from five cheetahs were pcr amplified. phylogenetic analyses of the cheetah strains and other known coronaviruses placed the cheetah fipv within the monophyletic group i lineage as close relatives of domestic cat fipv, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) and canine coronavirus (ccov) (fig. 3a) . furthermore, the polyphyletic arrangement of the cheetah strains interspersed with domestic cat fipv suggested few differences between the deadly cheetah virus and the more innocuous domestic cat virus (fig. 3b) . given the high genetic similarity between domestic cat fipv and cheetah fipv, and the fact that several lions (p. leo) at winston park became infected with the virus simultaneously but did not succumb to fip, we suggested the reason for the extremely high morbidity and mortality was due to host genetics.the cheetah is one of the most genetically homogeneous species within the cat family. the cheetah has as its closest relatives two north and south american species of puma (p. concolor) and jaguarondi (p. yagouaroundi) and together form the puma lineage (fig. 1) . fossil records indicate that cheetah once had a nearly global distribution, compared with its current distribution of sub-saharan africa and a relict population in iran (nowell and jackson, 1996) . a series of genetic studies of cheetah populations describe a species depauperate in genomic variation and this loss in genetic heterogeneity was most likely due to a severe population bottleneck that felled scores of large mammal species in north america, europe, asia and australia 10,000-12,000 years ago menotti-raymond and o'brien, 1993; o'brien et al., 1987) . the near extirpation led to generations of close inbreeding during the cheetah's ancestry reducing overall genomic diversity 10-100-fold (menotti-raymond and o'brien, 1993) . this reduction included variation in the immune response genes within the major histocompatibility complex (o'brien et al., 1985; o'brien and yuhki, 1999b; yuhki and o'brien, 1990) . the genetic basis for disease resistance is that inherent population genetic diversity provides a broad moving target for evolving pathogens. thus, when a microbe evolves a strategy to abrogate immune defenses of an individual, the genetically diverse population may still be protected. however, once virulence was achieved in the first cheetah, the conditions were set for transmission, pathogenesis and morbidity in the other individuals within the population made vulnerable by shared genetic and immunologic homogeneity.the parallels and lessons for sars have relevance to conservation of biodiversity in wildlife. first, the deadly coronaviruses in both human and cheetah represent profound consequences that may accompany viral emergence into a new host. phylogenetic analyses of genetic data clearly define the domestic cat origin of cheetah fipv (fig. 3a, b) and that the virus appeared to be highly pathogenic upon entering the new host. the similarity of the pattern of high pathogenicity with sars infection of humans suggests that the virus is potentially more benign in the reservoir species of bats, albeit this remains unconfirmed li et al., 2005) . even so, the pattern of genetic changes within the pathogen among fig. 1 from heeney et al., 1990) . titers are based on immunofluorescent assay of cultured cells. numbers are from the north american cheetah studbook numbers for individual cheetahs (marker and o'brien, 1989) . arrows represent date of death by aju-cov for each animal.the intermediate host of palm civet p. lavarta was very similar to those observed in human strains, and is consistent with the expectation of rapid evolution in the pathogen to adapt to the new host immune response (song et al., 2005) . second, while mortality in humans with sars symptoms (cdc, 2004) and in house cats with fipv (foley et al., 1997) was low (10% in humans, 5% in cats), infected cheetahs exhibited the opposite extreme with 90% morbidity and over 60% mortality (fig. 2) . as for cheetahs, the combined evidence suggests that genetic uniformity makes epidemics much worse. it is likely that variation in immune defense genes of humans and domestic cats protected them from a deadly disease, to which most exposed and genetically impoverished cheetahs succumbed (fig. 2) . thus, genomic characterization of both pathogen and host are key for conservation of biodiversity and prevention of disease outbreak. lastly, fipv in cheetahs and sars in humans are highly contagious, spreading rapidly in close quarters in weeks, if not days ( fig. 2; (shaw, 2006) ). this inherent ability of emergent pathogens to rapidly infect endangered populations should be an integral consideration for management strategies of re-introduction.aids had first appeared in humans in the early 1980s as a clustering of patients from homosexual communities in los angeles and new york city with a rare cancer, kaposi's sarcoma, and pneumonia. aids is caused by a lentivirus, a genus within the family retroviridae, termed human immunodeficiency virus or hiv that infects and destroys cd4bearing t-cells. there are two forms of hiv (types 1 and 2) and since its recognition in the early 1980s, hiv-1 has spread across the globe infecting 65 million people and killing over 22 million (www.unaids.org). aids is potentially the most deadly disease in recorded history because it is a disease with no vaccine and a treatment that slows the virus but does not clear it from sequestered cellular reservoirs, and has infected 65 million and continues to infect new cohorts within the world populations (rathbun et al., 2006) (www.unaids.org). the origin of the ongoing hiv-1 pandemic is recent and the virus entered humans early in the 20th century, originating from a subspecies of chimpanzee p. troglodytes troglodytes in central west africa . wild chimpanzees are infected with sivcpz (simian immunodeficiency virus) and genetic study affirms this strain is the closest genetic relative to hiv . additional evolutionary studies indicated these cross-species transmission events occurred more than once between chimpanzee and human to form hiv-1 subtypes m, n and o and at least once between sooty mangabey (cercocebus atys) and humans to form hiv-2 (gao et al., 1992) . in total, primate lentiviruses infect at least 23 species and like sivcpz are host-specific sharp et al., 1999; sharp et al., 2005) . all naturally occurring siv are in african primates and these species seem resistant to aids-like pathology. by contrast, asian species are fig. 4 -prevalence and distribution of fiv seroreactivity in free-ranging, and captive but wild-born, animals (troyer et al., 2005) the dark portion of the bar represents seropositives and the white represents seroindeterminates, giving conservative and liberal estimates of total seroprevalence of fiv. the number of animals tested for each species is given in parentheses. a black star indicates that pcr verification has been obtained from at least one free-ranging individual for that species. a white star indicates that pcr verification has been obtained from at least one captive, but wild-born individual for that species.

(b) percent seroreactivity in american felids (excluding kodkod and canadian lynx, for which there were no wild-born samples). (c) percent seroreactivity in eurasian felids (excluding lynx, bay cat, rusty spotted cat and chinese dessert cat, for which there were no wild-born samples). naïve, and do develop aids when infected with the siv from african primates (hirsch, 2004) .the sole naturally occurring model for aids disease in humans is the feline homologue of hiv, feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv). although related lentiviruses are found in other species such as sheep and goats (caprine arthritis encephalitis virus -caev), horse (equine infectious anemia virus -eiav), and cattle (bovine immunodeficiency virus -biv), only fiv in domestic cats causes aids-like disease. fiv was first discovered in 1986 in a house cat with a wasting-like disease (pedersen et al., 1987) . currently, fiv is epidemic among feral domestic cats throughout the world and is associated with an aids-like syndrome of immune depletion, increased susceptibility to rare cancers and opportunistic disease, and death (bendinelli et al., 1995; willett et al., 1997) . fiv has a small viral rna genome of about 9000 nucleotides that is similar in sequence, gene content, and gene arrangement to that of hiv-1 (miyazawa et al., 1994) .as with primate lentiviruses, fiv naturally infects multiple species of cat in the wild. western blot screening of antibodies against fiv in free-ranging non-domestic cat species (fig. 4) revealed that several were exposed to the virus (carpenter and o'brien, 1995; olmsted et al., 1989; olmsted et al., 1992; troyer et al., 2005) . a recent comprehensive survey of serum and lymphocyte specimens from 3055 individuals within 35 felidae and 3 hyenidae species used three fiv antigens isolated from domestic cat, lion, and puma as targets of western blot plus pcr-based fiv genome sequence amplification as a validation of fiv infection (troyer et al., 2005) . those results revealed that at least 11 free ranging felidae species harbor fiv antibodies and fiv viral genomes (fig. 4) . these species are distributed across africa including lion, leopard (p. pardus), and cheetah along with two hyenidae species of spotted hyena (crocuta crocuta) and striped hyena (hyaena hyaena). fiv positive species occur in north and south america including puma, jaguaroundi (p. onca), jaguarondi, ocelot (leopardus pardalis), margay (l. weidii), geoffroy's cat (l. geoffroyi), tigrina (l. tigrina) and in asia with pallas cat (otocolobus manul). eight other species had western blot signals of antibodies, but did not yield fiv sequences using multiple pcr primers which is likely due to divergence within the primer binding sites, exceedingly low proviral load, or both (fig. 4) . overall, inclusion of fiv western blot results from captive individuals indicates that as many as 31 species of cat are susceptible to fiv infection and may harbor species specific viruses or be infected with non-native virus (troyer et al., 2005) (fig. 4) . further, the distribution of fiv is not uniform among cat species, being endemic in africa and north and south america, but rare in species from europe and asia (fig. 4) .phylogenetic analyses of the pol-rt region (476 bp) isolated in felidae species reveal the sequences form species-specific monophyletic clades (fig. 5) . this monophyletic pattern suggests that fiv does not spread among species easily. rather, fiv infected an ancestor of each host and then evolved within that species. there have been exceptions to this finding, but only in captive animals and these occur rarely. for example, the captive snow leopard (p. uncia) fiv sequence is well within the african lion fiv clade a (fig. 5) . another example is a captive puma infected with a domestic cat strain of fiv (carpen-ter et al., 1996) . however, in the wild, opportunities for interspecies transmission are limited and thus the virus becomes adapted to its particular host. this evolutionary pattern resembles that of naturally occurring siv in african primates, where siv forms monophyletic lineages that are specific to each species (allan et al., 1991; sharp et al., 2005) and are host-dependent. yet, fiv transmission may have a geographic component whereby species in close proximity share more similar fiv strains. this is suggested in the common node shared by leopard fiv and cheetah fiv (fig. 5) .clinical consequences for fiv infection in most nondomestic felidae species is not known, and there has been little convincing acute disease or patterned disease symptoms associated with fiv infection as is observed consistently for domestic cats. only one example of fiv-related mortality has been documented in a species other than domestic cat, a captive lion . the lack of documentation of clinical signs of fiv infection in wild populations may reflect logistic obstacles and expenses in routine physicals for these species. alternatively, these species-specific fiv strains may have undergone a prolonged period of co-adaptation with their respective host and may be less pathogenic as a consequence carpenter and o'brien, 1995) . in the following study with lions, we describe how current conservation efforts with endangered cat species are integrating genetic studies of fiv in natural populations.natural populations of african lions represent one of the longest running studies of fiv infected felids in the wild (brown et al., 1994; troyer et al., 2004) . a western blot survey of lions throughout africa (fig. 6) indicates fiv antibody seroprevalence can range from 0% (in namibia and kalahari) to >94% in the serengeti in tanzania and kruger park in south africa. this east-west discordance in fiv seroprevalence may be a consequence of geographic barriers such as the kalahari desert. however, it is not clear whether these geographic differences in fiv prevalence (most were sampled only once) reflect an ongoing spread or a stable restriction of fiv spread in the low incidence regions. phylogenetic analysis of fiv rt-pol sequences in lions reveal the persistence of at least six principal viral clades or subtypes (a-f) represented in different populations of lions in africa. some are unique to certain populations (e.g. subtype e in botswana, subtype c in the serengeti and subtype f in kenya) while others are present in multiple populations (fig. 7) . the genetic distances among these lion fiv subtypes are as great as the distance observed between fiv isolates from different cat species (figs. 5, 7) . this level of separation would suggest that the clades evolved in isolation. the common monophyletic node uniting all lion fiv strains suggests that fiv infected a common ancestor early in lion population history. the virus subtypes then evolved in isolation with specific lion populations as observed with subtypes c, d, and e. in the case of subtype a and b, it is likely that these evolved in formerly geographically isolated lion populations that recently came together allowing the transmission of the virus subtypes currently observed. because there is little known of disease associations with fiv infection in lions it is difficult to know whether there are now (or ever were) virulence distinctions among the clades.one of the most detailed lion population studies is that of the serengeti in tanzania. this large panmictic population over 3000 individuals has provided many useful insights into lion pride structure, population dynamics, and transmission of infectious diseases (gilbert et al., 1991; hofmann-lehmann et al., 1996; muller-graf et al., 1999; munson et al., 1996; packer et al., 2005) . long-term surveillance of lions in the serengeti has not revealed any evidence of aids like illnesses, decreased viability, or decreased fecundity in this population where seroprevalence among adult lions is 100%. these observations of (relatively) benign infection are similar to those for fiv in north american puma (biek et al., 2006; biek et al., 2003) and consistent with the notion that fiv has persisted in these host species longer than in domestic cat and that significant host adaptation has already occurred carpenter and o'brien, 1995) . however, recently we have shown that lions infected with fiv have significantly lower cd4 counts than uninfected animals suggesting that there may be sub-clinical immunological effects associated with fiv-infection in this population (roelke et al., in press) . at one stage we also suspected that infection with one clade of fiv might be a natural vaccine against infection with another or the mutational occurrence of a virulent deadly fiv variant (carpenter and o'brien, 1995) . however, troyer et al. (2004) inspected the pattern of fiv subtype distribution among 13 serengeti lion prides and discovered multiple clade infections (i.e., two or three subtypes of virus present in the same lion) in 43% of the infected lions, an observation that would argue against acquired immunity by infection with a single strain.in 1994, the serengeti lions became the target of a deadly infectious disease outbreak that caused whisker twitches, neurological seizures, and death to over 1000 lions, a third of the population. fiv was excluded as the primary cause since several afflicted lions were fiv negative (roelke-parker et al., 1996) . the etiological agent was a hyper-virulent form of a canine distemper virus (cdv) a virus previously known to infect but seldom cause morbidity in felidae species (roelke-parker et al., 1996) . this time, in the most deadly reported outbreak of the cdv among african carnivore species, a virulent transmissible cdv variant spread from domestic dogs living around the serengeti park to hyena, bat eared foxes otocyon megalotis, and to lions (carpenter et al., 1998) .although fiv was not the primary explanation for the 1994 serengeti lion mortality, it may have played a supporting role. hiv infection in humans causes increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections of normally benign infectious agents (like hhv8/kaposi's sarcoma, pneumocystis carnii pneumonia or cytomegalovirus) as a consequence of cd4 t-lymphocyte depletion and immune collapse (levy, 1993) . nearly all the lions in the serengeti carried fiv, and fiv has been shown to be associated with depleted cd4-lymphocyte counts of 200 cells/ll compared with counts of 800-1000 cells/ll in uninfected individuals (roelke et al., in press ). one could speculate that adult lions may have done better in defending against cdv had they not been afflicted with lentivirus that depletes their principal defense against viruses, the cd4 lymphocyte population. while there were fiv-negative animals that died, these were all juveniles (roelke-parker et al., 1996) and it is possible that their immature immune system may have accounted for their susceptibility to the new virus.the african lion study provides some useful insights on the impact of infectious disease in endangered populations. development of detection methods and effective monitoring of the health of animals in the wild is problematic, and as in the case of the cdv outbreak, was documented only due to the presence of researchers already in place to collect samples and observe the final outcome. although this cdv outbreak was marked by relatively high mortality estimates (roelke-parker et al., 1996) , subsequent outbreaks were less virulent within the same population. until we fully understand the immunological effects of infection with prevalent fiv strains, the interaction of pathogens such as cdv and fiv, and the role of the host immune system in modulating these viral infections, the question of their importance and collaborations in pathogenesis will continue.one approach is to continue to adapt and apply new technologies developed from human biomedical research to conservation of wildlife. for example, the massive research effort into understanding hiv in humans offers new technologies to apply towards related viruses such as fiv in endangered cat species. recognition that fiv causes aids-like disease in domestic cat and that this is a natural model for hiv in humans, has led to extensive surveillance of fiv in other species (biek et al., 2006; biek et al., 2003; carpenter et al., 1996; carpenter and o'brien, 1995; olmsted et al., 1992; troyer et al., 2004; troyer et al., 2005) , an essential step in determining the genetic diversity of the pathogen. knowledge of key amino acid motifs in the env gene of hiv linked with evading host immune surveillance (wyatt and sodroski, 1998; yusim et al., 2002) is in turn targets for comparative genomic research of virulence in fiv (de parseval et al., 2006) . understanding how genetic diversity within mhc in humans is linked with either resistance to hiv or increased susceptibility (carrington and o'brien, 2003) provides an incentive to sequence mhc in multiple mammalian taxa, including cats (yuhki et al., 2003; yuhki and o'brien, 1990) . the links between hiv in humans and fiv in endangered cat species illustrate the utility of biomedical approaches and discoveries that is directly applicable to elucidating the role of disease in endangered species. tion. the advances in molecular biology, immunology and genetics provide a diverse collection of effective tools for unraveling the secrets to survival. as the tools that are used in human medicine become available to wildlife research, new approaches and understanding of disease outbreaks and effective host control of infection are increasingly possible.unfortunately, in wildlife populations, few disease outbreaks are followed from start to finish and the vast majority remain completely unobserved and undocumented [but see randall et al. on ethiopian wolves and other papers in this special edition]. for this reason, our understanding of the effects of population demographics, genetics, mating and migration patterns on the spread of (and ultimately clearance of and/or adaptation to) disease is limited.these examples of fipv and fiv illustrate a critical need for consistent programs designed to monitor and survey endangered populations. conservation strategies that incorporate biological sampling yield invaluable genetic profiles of disease and disease resistance within endangered species. genomic analyses provide insight into the history of a population and its pathogen(s) that can assist in documenting patterns of co-evolution and adaptation. yet, these examples underscore the unpredictable aspects of epidemics within natural populations of threatened or endangered species and there is need for much more comprehensive and longterm data. finally, conservation management would clearly benefit from a better knowledge of viral evolution, adaptation, and cross-species infections to plan protected areas, inform strategies of re-introduction and relocation, and provide effective interventions in cases of potential disease epidemics. by resolving the root causes of human and animal outbreaks and their outcomes, we shall continue to learn lessons such as the cats have shared on sars and aids.respiratory tract infections (rtis) are caused by various pathogens that are often indistinguishable from one another by clinical diagnosis. rtis are a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization, especially in children aged below five years, and pose significant economic burden [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .most rtis are caused by viruses. common respiratory viruses include influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), human coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hmpv), and rhinovirus [7, 8] .rapid and accurate identification of the causative pathogens of rtis can help guide treatment decisions, possibly reducing the length of hospital stays and associated 2 advances in virology healthcare costs. moreover, it aids in epidemiologic tracking of local outbreaks or epidemics by implementing proper infection control measures and administering effective antimicrobial therapy. rapid laboratory identification of rti pathogens has been associated with up to 50% reduction in hospital stays, 30% reduction in the inappropriate use of antibiotics, and 20% reduction in unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures [9] . multiplexed molecular assays that can concurrently detect multiple pathogens from the same sample in a single reaction have been increasingly adopted in clinical microbiology laboratories in the recent years [10] . several studies have shown that these molecular tests have superior diagnostic capacity and cost-effectiveness of molecular tests when compared to conventional and other diagnostic methods [11, 12] .for influenza viruses, rapid molecular tests based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using primers that target the relatively conserved matrix (m) gene are frequently used for achieving rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis. however, variations in the gene and amino acid sequences in different influenza virus subtypes due to rapid mutations of the viral rna polymerase may affect the results of these tests. with the emergence of human infections due to the swineorigin influenza a h3n2 variant (h3n2v) virus in north america in 2010 and more recently the avian-origin influenza a h7n9 and h5n6 in china [13] [14] [15] , it would be important to ascertain the analytical sensitivities of these rapid tests for the novel influenza viruses [16, 17] . in a previous study, we have demonstrated that xtag rvp has lower sensitivity for detection of h7n9 in patient samples and culture isolates [16, 17] .nxtag respiratory pathogen panel (rpp), ce-ivd (luminex molecular diagnostics, toronto, canada), is a recent new qualitative multiplex molecular test for the detection of nucleic acids from multiple respiratory viruses and bacteria extracted from respiratory specimens. it detects 22 viral and bacterial targets including influenza a virus, influenza a virus subtype seasonal h1, influenza a virus subtype seasonal h3, influenza a virus subtype swine-origin h1n1pdm09, influenza b virus, rsv a and b, parainfluenza viruses types 1 to 4, adenovirus, hmpv, rhinovirus/enterovirus, human coronavirus-(hcov-) 229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-nl63, hcov-hku1, human bocavirus, chlamydophila pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella pneumophila (table 1) . although there were several studies about the performance of nxtag rpp using ruo (research use only) assay, the performance of the nxtag rpp, cv-ivd, for detection of respiratory viruses, particularly the sensitivity and specificity of influenza a subtypes, remains unclear [18] [19] [20] . the purpose of this study is to evaluate the nxtag rpp, ce-ivd, and compare it with luminex xtag respiratory viral panel (rvp) fast v2 (luminex molecular diagnostics, toronto, canada) and fil-marray respiratory panel (rp) (biomérieux, marcy l'étoile, france), using nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa) samples obtained from patients with rtis and culture isolates of different swine and avian-origin influenza a subtypes (h2n2, h3n2v, h5n1, h5n6, h7n9, and h9n2).the 133 npa specimens selectively collected from patients with symptoms and signs of rtis who were managed in queen mary hospital, hong kong, and with clinical pcr results were used in this study. these npa samples were collected into a viral transport medium as described previously [21] and were tested by direct immunofluorescence (dfa) (d 3 [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . all these pcr results were used as positive reference. the remaining samples were then recruited for nxtag rvp evaluation. a sufficient quantity of the samples was used for further testing with xtag rvp and filmarray rp. cells with tosyl sulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-(tpck-) treated trypsin (2 g/ml) (sigma, st. louis, mo) as previously described [28] . aliquots of culture supernatant were frozen at −80 ∘ c until use. serial tenfold dilutions of the virus stock with serum-free minimal essential medium (mem) (gibco brl, grand island, ny) were tested in nxtag rpp, xtag rvp, and filmarray rp. the viral m gene genome copy numbers per ml of each virus dilution were determined by real-time, quantitative rt-pcr (q-pcr) as previously described with modification [29, 30] . briefly, 5 l purified rna was amplified in a 25 l reaction containing 0.5 l superscript iii reverse transcriptase/platinum taq dna polymerase (invitrogen, carlsbad, california, usa), 0.05 l rox reference dye (25 mm), 12.5 l of 2x reaction buffer, 800 nmol/l forward primer (5 -gaccra-tcctgtcacctctgac-3 ), 800 nmol/l reverse primer (5 -agggcattytggacaaakcgtcta-3 ), and probe 200 nmol/l (fam-5 -tgcagtcctcgctcactgggc-acg-3 -bhq1). the thermal cycling conditions were 30 minutes at 50 ∘ c for reverse transcription and then 2 min at 95 ∘ c for rt inactivation/initial denaturation, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 ∘ c and 30 s at 55 ∘ c. all reactions 18 20 were performed using steponeplus real-time pcr system (applied biosystems, foster city). for quantitative assay, a reference standard plasmid was prepared by cloning the target m gene amplicon into pcrii-topo vector (topo6 ta cloning6 kit, invitrogen, san diego, ca) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the copy number of the standard plasmid was determined based on molar concentration of the plasmid (1 molar is equivalent to about 6.0221415 × 10 23 copies numbers). a series of 6 log10 dilutions, equivalent to 1 × 10 1 to 1 × 10 6 copies per reaction, were then prepared from the reference standard plasmid to generate calibration curves and run in parallel with the test samples. the limit of detection of the m gene qrt-pcr is 10 copies per reaction at 95% confidence level. the same virus dilutions were inoculated onto mdck cells to determine the 50% tissue culture infective dose (tcid50) using the reed-muench method as previously described [28] .nucleic acid was detected using easymag extraction platform (biomérieux, marcy l'étoile, france) and extracted for nxtag rpp and xtag rvp from the specimens as previously described [31] . total nucleic acid extraction was isolated by using the nuclisens easy-mag instrument (biomérieux). briefly, 10 l of ms2 internal control was first added to 200 l of sample. the mixture was added to 2 ml of lysis buffer and was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. the lysed sample was then transferred to the well of a plastic vessel with 100 l of silica. this was followed by automatic magnetic separation. nucleic acid was recovered in 110 l elution buffer. by using a parallel specimen (300 l), nucleic acid extraction, pcr, and detection were performed in filmarray according to the manufacturer's instructions. the nxtag rpp incorporates multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) with the luminex proprietary universal tag sorting system on the luminex platform for detecting respiratory pathogen targets according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, the extracted total nucleic acid is added to preplated lyophilized bead reagents (lbrs) and mixed to resuspend the reaction reagents. the reaction is amplified via rt-pcr and the reaction product undergoes bead hybridization within the sealed reaction well. the hybridized, tagged beads are then sorted and read on the magpix instrument, and the signals are analyzed using the nxtag respiratory pathogen panel assay file for synct6 software (luminex, austin, texas, usa).diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, ppv, and npv of the assays against the positive references and agreement between the assays were calculated by vassarstats: website for statistical computation (http:// vassarstats.net). we have previously shown that xtag rvp has low sensitivity for detecting h7n9 [16, 17] . in this study, one of the patient specimens with confirmed h7n9 influenza a infection was also not detected by xtag rvp influenza a but was detected by nxtag rpp and filmarray rp influenza a. xtag rvp has a 1000 and 10 times higher limit of detection for h7n9 than nxtag rpp and filmarray rp, respectively (table 3 ). these findings show that nxtag rrp has greatly improved the sensitivity for detecting h7n9 over the xtag rvp. besides, nxtag rpp has also improved sensitivity for detecting other respiratory viruses over xtag rvp (1 adenovirus and 2 bocavirus). these findings corroborate another recent report on the partial comparison between the nxtag respiratory pathogen panel assay and the luminex xtag respiratory panel fast assay v2 [32] . nxtag rpp detected 12 more pathogens than filmarray rp in our study, with 50% (6/12) being enterovirus/rhinovirus. the other additional positives detected by nxtag rpp were adenovirus (2), parainfluenza virus 4b (1), hmpv (1), h1n1pdm (1), and m. pneumoniae (1) . overall, 8 positives, hmpv (1), p2 (1), p4 (3), enterovirus/rhinovirus (2), and m. pneumoniae (1), were not detected by nxtag rpp. all these positives indeed had high ct value (≥35) that may be lower than the limit of detection by nxtag rpp. further study should be required if the primers that are suspected do not detect epidemic strains.furthermore, the results of 5 samples (4 h1n1pdm 2009 and 1 h7n9) were reported to be "equivocal" by filmarray rp (flu a-pan-1 positive, flu a-pan-2 negative). these 5 specimens were, in fact, true positive as confirmed by other testing methods. these findings indicated that m gene (flu a-pan-1) was more sensitive than ns1 gene (flu a-pan-2) for detection of h1n1pdm 2009.when influenza a virus subtype isolates were tested, the mean (range) analytic sensitivities (viral load log10 copies/ml and tcid 50 /ml) of nxtag rpp, xtag rvp, and filmarray rp were 3.0 (1.8-4.2) and 0.7 (0.0056-3.2); 4.3 (3.0-6.4) and 41.8 (0.56-178); and 3.4 (2.7-4.4) and 0.8 (0.1-1.78), respectively (table 3 ). all avian-and swine-origin influenza a strains were detected by m gene in nxtag rpp, xtag rvp, and filmarray rp. the swine-origin h1n1pdm09 was correctly genotyped by nxtag rpp and filmarray rp. however, h3n2v and seasonal h3n2 could not be differentiated by nxtag rpp.in the recent years, the availability of molecular diagnostic tests has revolutionized the diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases and treatment of rtis. multiplexed molecular assays simultaneously detect multiple pathogens from the same sample in a single reaction vessel, providing a more comprehensive picture of infection. in this study, the clinical performance of the luminex nxtag rpp (cv-ivd) in npa specimens was found to have high sensitivity (95.2%) and specificity (99.6%) for detection of respiratory viruses. these findings are similar to those reported in recent evaluation studies using nxtag rpp (ruo) kit by other groups [18] [19] [20] . the performances of the nxtag rpp, xtag rvp, and filmarray rp were also compared. their results were highly concordant, with the highest concordance reported between nxtag rrp and xtag rvp [kappa value = 0.97 (95% cl: 0.95-0.99)].according to the manufacturer, m gene (flu a-pan-1) and ns1 gene (flu a-pan-2) are used for influenza a typing by filmarray rp. the result is only interpreted as positive when both genes are positive. the result will be interpreted as "equivocal" when only flu a-pan-1 is positive, and the system will suggest the users to repeat testing by the same assay or other assays. in this study, the results showed that an "equivocal" result by filmarray rp is most likely to be a true positive. the correct interpretation of these results should be considered to avoid delay in diagnosis and treatment particularly in patients with severe influenza a virus infection.in general, the analytical sensitivities of the nxtag rpp and filmarray rp for the swine-and avian-origin influenza viruses were comparable, but xtag rvp had more than one log lower analytical sensitivity than nxtag rpp and filmarray rp (table 3 ). nxtag rpp also had higher analytical sensitivity for detecting h5n6 than the xtag rvp but the same sensitivity as filmarray rp and higher analytical sensitivity for detecting h3n2v than xtag rvp and filmarray rp. all three multiplex assays accurately typed and genotyped the influenza viruses, except for nxtag rrp that does not distinguish subtyped h3n2 from h3n2v. this finding was further confirmed by testing another h3n2v strain, a/indiana/08/2011, with 500tcid 50 . a recent study also showed that nxtag rpp (ruo) only correctly genotyped 95.5% of influenza a virus h1n1pdm09 strains [19] .rapid multiplex rt-pcr assays for respiratory pathogens detection are important for establishing diagnosis to facilitate the implementation of appropriate treatment and infection control measures. sensitive and specific laboratory diagnosis advances in virology 5 of all influenza a virus subtypes is especially essential in certain epidemic regions, such as southeast asia. the correct interpretation of these results is also important and would avoid delay in patient management and infection control, especially in patients with severe seasonal influenza a or avian/swine-origin influenza a virus subtype infection. clinical microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, and laboratory managers should be aware of and understand the different clinical performances of these commercially available molecular multiplex rt-pcr assays that are commonly adopted in many clinical microbiology laboratories. the sensitivity and specificity of these molecular multiplex assays must be predetermined and be able to confidently detect most of the important avian or swine influenza a subtype infection including h5n1 and h7n9 and this capability is particularly important for use in southeast asia.a limitation of this study is that some target numbers are small. this is due to low prevalent disease and may require a longer period in order to collect a higher number of positives. high cost for these multiplex assays is another limitation for us to study more samples.in this study, the results showed that nxtag rpp, xtag rvp, and filmarray rp assays had high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of respiratory diseases. they are suitable for use in clinical diagnostic laboratories for detection of respiratory pathogens in patients with rtis. however, awareness should be raised that h3n2 could not be distinguished from h3n2v by nxtag rpp. further investigation should be performed if h3n2v is suspected to be the cause of disease.this study was approved by the institutional review board of the university of hong kong/hospital authority hong kong west cluster.the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.the prevalance of respiratory viruses among healthcare workers serving pilgrims in makkah during the 2009 influenza a (h1n1) pandemic keywords hajj; viral; respiratory; healthcare workers; h1n1 summary despite the high risk of acquiring respiratory infections, healthcare workers who treat pilgrims at hajj have not been studied in previous research on respiratory diseases during hajj. the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of different respiratory viruses among healthcare workers who treated pilgrims during hajj 2009, the year of the influenza a h1n1 pandemic. a cross-sectional study was performed just before and after hajj (25e29 november, 2009). nasal and throat swabs were tested for 18 respiratory virus types and subtypes. a total of 184 healthcare workers were examined. most were men (85%) with an average age of 41 years. before the hajj, rates of seasonal influenza vaccination were higher (51%) than rates of pandemic influenza a h1n1 vaccination (22%). after the hajj, participants reported high rates of maintaining hand hygiene (98%), cough etiquette (89%), and wearing a face mask (90%). among all the viruses tested, only two were detected: rhinovirus was detected in 12.6% and coronavirus 229e in 0.6%. rhinovirus was detected in 21% of those who had respiratory symptoms during hajj. influenza a (including h1n1), influenza b. respiratory syncytial virus, other coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus were not detected. the finding of high rates of rhinovirus infection corresponds to their frequent occurrence in adults. none of the participants had influenza a h1n1 2009, possibly because it was also infrequent among the 2009 pilgrims. ª 2011 elsevier ltd. all rights

of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003, attack rates were more than 50% in healthcare workers. 1 healthcare workers who see pilgrims during hajj (the annual muslim pilgrimage to makkah) may be at higher risk of acquiring respiratory and other infections. 2, 3 because of these risks, special immunization requirements have been proposed to protect healthcare workers, 4 although healthcare workers have not been included in previous studies of respiratory diseases during hajj. 2, 5 hajj is the largest annual mass gathering in the world; it brings more than two million people from different countries together in a small, confined area. the extreme overcrowding of pilgrims during hajj reaches about 7 persons per meter; combined with fatigue and extremely hot weather during much of the year, this crowding may increase the risk of transmitting air-and droplet-borne infectious diseases, particularly respiratory viruses. 3,5e7 an estimated one in three pilgrims experience respiratory symptoms. 6 several transmissible bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens have been reported among pilgrims, notably meningococci of all serotypes, streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-negative organisms, atypical organisms, mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza a and b viruses, rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses. 5,6,8e10 in april of 2009, a novel influenza a strain (h1n1 2009 strain) in mexico spread globally. 11, 12 the toll was particularly heavy in saudi arabia, which ranked fourth of 22 countries in the eastern mediterranean region in deaths and probable h1n1 cases. 13 the 2009 hajj took place in november, six months later, and presented a public health challenge for infection control authorities in saudi arabia. 14 several practices to minimize disease transmission among pilgrims and healthcare workers were instituted even before the beginning of hajj season, since pre-hajj data showed low acceptance rates of h1n1 vaccine among healthcare workers. 15, 16 this study evaluated the prevalence of viral respiratory pathogens among healthcare workers during the 2009 hajj which coincided with the influenza a h1n1 2009 pandemic.healthcare workers, including physicians, nurses, health inspectors, and others, who served pilgrims during the 2009 hajj season were included. three-fourths of the healthcare workers in the study were from the saudi ministry of health (moh), and the rest were from medical missions other than moh. most of the healthcare workers had treated pilgrims previously and had been practicing medicine for more than 10 years.the main religious activities of the 2009 hajj season started on 25th november 2009 with a visit to the holy kaaba and continued for 5 or 6 days at different holy sites in mina, arafat, and muzdalifa.the current study was a cross-sectional study performed in two phases. the first phase was conducted during the week before the start of hajj on november 25th, and the second phase was conducted in the week following the end of hajj on november 30th. healthcare workers were asked to answer a questionnaire and provide nasal and throat swabs both before and after hajj.the pre-hajj questionnaire was about demographics (age, sex, occupation, and nationality), medical history (chronic disease and smoking), vaccination history (including h1n1 and seasonal influenza), and knowledge of h1n1 influenza (symptoms, transmission, and prevention). the post-hajj questionnaire included questions about exposure to infections during hajj and compliance with infection control practices (hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and wearing a mask).nasal and throat swabs were collected using the same method during both phases of the study. nose and throat swabs were collected in viral transport media using dacron swabs on stainless steel wire and plastic shafts, respectively (remel, microtest m4rt, usa). immediately after collection, samples were transported to the jeddah regional laboratory where they were stored at à80 c until tested. nucleic acid was extracted using the x-tractor gene, corbett from qiagen using 25101 vx dna/rna purification protocol. the multiplex pcr using micro fluid arrays and luminex x-map system, with xtag respiratory viral panel fast assay (manufactured by luminex molecular diagnostics, inc, toronto, on, canada, distributed by abbott molecular, wiesbaden-delkenheim, germany) was used for nucleic acid testing for 18 circulating respiratory virus types and subtypes: influenza a, influenza a h1, influenza a h3, influenza b, rsv, coronavirus 229e, coronavirus oc 43, coronavirus nl63, coronavirus hku1, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, parainfluenza 3, parainfluenza 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human bocavirus.the xtag data analysis software for rvp fast(tdas rvp fast) analyzed the data and provided a report summarizing which viruses were present. the rvp fast detects influenza b, influenza a h1 seasonal, and influenza a h3 only. if any other subtypes are present, it will indicate the presence of influenza a matrix protein only. therefore the samples in which influenza a matrix protein was detected were run separately by a singleplex pcr to detect h1 2009 pandemic strain using artus inf/h1 lc/rg rt-pcr kit (qiagen) and for avian influenza a h5n1 (subtype asia) by lightmix kit (tib, molbiol,gmbh, berlin, germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. any strain in which rna was not detected for these four influenza a types (i.e., h1, h3 seasonal in rvp fast and independent singleplex pcrs for h1 2009 pandemic strain, and h5n1 [subtype asia]) was labeled as unsubtypeable influenza a virus.demographics, medical history, vaccination history, knowledge of h1n1 influenza, and compliance with infection control practices are presented as frequencies. the prevalence of respiratory viruses is presented as number of viruses per 1000 healthcare workers. differences in the prevalence of respiratory viruses before and after the hajj were examined using non-parametric paired statistics a total of 184 healthcare workers who treated pilgrims during the 2009 hajj season were included in the study. of these, 161 answered the (main) pre-hajj questionnaire and 104 answered the (short) post-hajj questionnaire. a total of 120 combined nasal and throat swabs were obtained during the pre-and post-hajj periods. demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample are shown in table 1 . the majority of the healthcare workers were males (85%) with an average age of 40.9 ae 9.2 years (range 23e59 years), non-saudi (71%), physicians (75%), with more than 10 years of medical experience (60%) as well as previous experience of serving in hajj medical services (83%).most of the healthcare workers (93%) described their own health as very good to excellent.chronic disease, namely hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were present in 15% and 11% were current smokers. compliance of healthcare workers with pre-hajj vaccination and infection control is shown in table 2 . eighty four percent of them got at least one vaccine before hajj. the coverage of hepatitis b, meningococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines were relatively high (73%, 67% and 51%, respectively), while the coverage of h1n1 vaccine was considerably low (22%). the main reasons described for not getting the vaccine were worries about the side effects, (42%), non-availability (34%), and fear of developing h1n1 symptoms (22%). approximately 50% of the healthcare workers did not get seasonal influenza vaccine in the past year due to the belief of being healthy (29%), lack of knowledge about the place to get the vaccine (22%), and the assumption that influenza is not a serious illness (18%). compliance with hand hygiene was noted in 98%, cough etiquette in 89% and wearing face mask in 90% of the healthcare workers. the exposure risk as defined by being within 1 m from a person with ili was reported in 61%, handling biological specimens in 34% and examining patients in 76%. about 20% of them got sick or injured during hajj.background knowledge of the healthcare workers about h1n1 2009 is shown in tables 3 and 4 . eighty five percent believed that h1n1 is a serious disease, 80% were worried about catching h1n1 influenza during hajj and 75% were aware of the main symptoms of h1n1 influenza. the main source or vehicle of h1n1 transmission as recognized by them were contact with people infected with h1n1 (86%), contaminated fomites (72%) and air (65%). appreciable level of knowledge about measures to avoid h1n1 infection were noted as described by maintenance of hand hygiene (91%), wearing a mask (76%), cough/sneeze etiquette (76%), staying away from sick people (65%), using hand sanitizer (63%), avoiding crowds/public gatherings (62%) and taking h1n1 vaccine (58%).among the 18 circulating respiratory virus types and subtypes, only two were detected in the healthcare workers in the pre-and post-hajj period: rhinovirus (n z 21, 12.6%) and coronavirus 229e (n z 1, 0.6%) . rhinovirus was detected more before the hajj (n z 14, 11.7%) than after (n z 9, 7.5%), but the difference was not statistically significant. the only isolate of coronavirus was detected in the post-hajj period. two healthcare workers had rhinovirus detected both before and after the hajj. rhinovirus was detected in 21.1% of those who had respiratory symptoms and 30.0% of those who got sick during hajj. no other respiratory viruses were detected in any of the samples.the prevalence (per 100 persons) of respiratory viruses according to age, sex, profession, smoking, vaccine, sickness, and wearing a mask is shown in fig. 1 . the prevalence was slightly higher in healthcare workers who got sick during hajj, in nurses, and in those who did not wear masks than in smokers; however, the difference was not statistically significant.hajj, the annual pilgrimage of muslims is a time of a unique mass gathering event in makkah. around two million people are confined to small area and the chances of having infections acquired by respiratory tract are increased. al-tamami et al, 10 during the 2001 hajj, found 23 cases of meningitis of all types, mainly in indians, whose ages ranged from 1 to 70 years, and in twice as many women as men. balkhy et al, 6 in 2004, studied 500 symptomatic pilgrims, 10.8% of whom had positive viral cultures. of these, influenza b accounted for 50%, followed by herpes simplex virus (21.4%), rsv (12.9%), parainfluenza (7.4%) and influenza a (5.6%). a comparative study of respiratory tract infections in symptomatic uk and saudi pilgrims by rashid et al. in 2008 8 found infections in 25% of uk pilgrims but in only 13% of saudi pilgrims. half of the infections in uk pilgrims were due to rhinoviruses, followed by influenza virus, parainfluenza, and rsv. the saudi pilgrims had higher infection rates with influenza virus (78.5%) than with rhinovirus (21.4%). in 2009, alborzi et al. 9 also reported that 32.5% of patients tested had viral pathogens: influenza in 25 (9.8%), parainfluenza in 19 (7.4%), rhinovirus in 15 (5.9%), adenovirus in 14 (5.4%), enterovirus in 5 (2%), and rsv in 4 (1.6%) and coinfection with two viruses in 1 patient (0.4%).the current study evaluated the prevalence of respiratory viruses in healthcare workers who saw pilgrims after the h1n1 2009 pandemic had been declared. we tested for 18 respiratory virus types and subtypes in the healthcare workers and found primarily rhinoviruses and a single coronavirus 229e. rhinoviruses were more prevalent after the hajj (11.7%) than before (7.5%). none of the healthcare workers tested positive for any influenza virus, including the h1n1 2009 pandemic strain. this is explained by the fact that among more than two million pilgrims in 2009, the ministry of health reported only 100 cases of h1n1 and 5 deaths. 17 the high case-fatality ratio may be because pilgrims were committed to completing hajj and delayed seeking medical care until their condition had worsened. 17, 18 since the overall number of cases among pilgrims was low, therefore, the chances of transmitting it to healthcare workers were very small.rhinoviruses are present in about two-thirds of persons with common colds and probably are responsible for more human infections than any other agents. 19, 20 they are common in all age groups, occur throughout the year, and are present worldwide. 21 louis et al. 22 found that rhinovirus was responsible for half of the respiratory infections in residents and staff in a long-term care facility for elderly persons, although in community-dwelling elderly, they cause 63% of respiratory infections. 23 renois et al 24 found rhinoviruses to be most prevalent in cases of influenza-like illness in infections with one agent (25%) as well as in coinfections with influenza a h1n1 viruses (50%). our finding that rhinoviruses are the most prevalent viruses in healthcare workers during the 2009 hajj are consistent with the other studies of rhinoviruses in the general population, in patients with influenza-like illness, and also in pilgrims.arruda et al. 25 studied the natural history of rhinovirus infections in adults during autumn and found that among 346 persons with colds, 82% (283) had rhinovirus infections and 8% had coronavirus oc43 and 229e. these findings agree with our finding of rhinovirus as the predominantly isolated virus (12.6%), followed by coronavirus 229e (0.6%), in a group of subjectively healthy healthcare workers. arruda et al. isolated a high percentage of viruses because the subjects were symptomatic, while in our study rhinovirus was detected in 21% of participants with respiratory symptoms and in 30% who got sick during hajj. rhinoviruses spread efficiently in families, in school groups, among university students, and on military bases. 26, 27 linde et al. 28 found an increase in the proportion and number of rhinovirus diagnoses that roughly parallels a decrease in influenza diagnoses, after the summer holidays and start of schools. they hypothesize that a rhinovirus epidemic could interfere with the spread of pandemic influenza in a warm and humid climate, which decreases the spread of influenza by aerosol. a similar phenomenon may be responsible for the frequent isolation of rhinoviruses in the present study. rhinoviruses may protect the host from being infected by other viruses such as influenza a virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and rsv. 29 rhinovirus shedding is commonly limited to 10e14 days in immunocompetent subjects. 24 however viral rna may be present from days before symptoms occur to five or more weeks after they go away. 30, 31 the influenza a h1n1 vaccination rate in healthcare workers has been reported to be lower than the seasonal influenza vaccination rate 16, 32, 33 and was 22% versus 51% in the current study. these results are also comparable to the data obtained from the united states for the same period: where vaccination coverage for h1n1 in healthcare workers was 37% and for seasonal influenza it was 62%. 32, 33 in conclusion, we found that rhinoviruses were the most frequently isolated viruses in a group of subjectively healthy middle-aged healthcare workers who treated hajj pilgrims during the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic. respiratory symptoms were present in 21% of the healthcare workers in which the virus was detected. none of the participants had influenza a h1n1 2009, despite that only 22% of them were vaccinated against h1n1 vaccine, possibly because it was also infrequently found among pilgrims. usa, dr abduraman abudawod and dr. nedal almasri for their assistance in the data collection.the 2019 novel coronavirus strain (sars-cov-2) originating in wuhan, china has become a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates up to 2% of confirmed cases. the current case definition for confirmed covid-19 due to sars-cov-2 infection relies on pcr-positive nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens, with testing largely determined by presence of fever or respiratory symptoms in an individual at high epidemiologic risk. however, this case definition likely underestimates the prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection, as individuals who develop subclinical infection that does not produce fever or respiratory symptoms are unlikely to be tested, and testing by pcr of nasopharyngeal or respiratory specimens is unlikely to be 100% sensitive in detecting subclinical infection. widespread testing within the united states is also severely limited by the lack of available testing kits and testing capacity limitations of available public and private laboratories. therefore, the true prevalence of sars-cov-2 infection is currently unknown, and the sensitivity of pcr to detect infection is also unknown. serology can play an important role in defining both the prevalence of and sensitivity of pcr for sars-cov-2 infection, particularly for subclinical infection. this point is demonstrated by analogy with influenza virus, for which a meta-analysis of available literature measured the fraction of asymptomatic infections detected by pcr as approximately 16%, while the fraction of asymptomatic infections detected by seroconversion was measured as approximately 75% 1 . the seroprevalence of common human coronaviruses is known to increase throughout childhood to near 100% by adolescence 2 . thus, any serologic methodology to estimate prevalence of sars-cov-2 needs to identify and rule out cross-reactivity with these common human coronavirus strains. one challenge in applying serology to sars-cov-2 is that the choice of antigen and choice of assay is less well defined for coronavirus than more well studied viruses such as influenza. however, prior approaches to serologic detection of infection with emerging coronaviruses including sars and mers have focused on the s1 domain of the spike (s) glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid (n) protein, which are considered the immunodominant antigens for these viruses 3 . in particular, the s1 domain is strainspecific, while the n protein shows cross-reactivity across strains. the assay methodologies used for serologic detection of coronavirus infection include binding and neutralization assays. these methodologies have been shown to be well correlated 4 . however, neutralization assays require viral culture, which must be performed in high-level biosafety containment units for emerging coronaviruses with high epidemic potential such as sars-cov-2. conversely, binding assays such as elisa can be readily performed with widely available reagents and equipment so are field deployable and suitable for point of care testing. the protein microarray methodology has been widely used to simultaneously perform binding assays against hundreds of antigens printed onto a nitrocellulose-coated slide for detection of multiple antibody isotypes 5 . this methodology was recently demonstrated for simultaneous measurement of igg and iga antibodies against over 250 antigens from diverse strains and subtypes of influenza 6 . this methodology has previously been applied to detect antibodies against the s1 domains of sars and mers coronaviruses 7 .the blood specimens used in this study were collected for a larger study where residents of a college resident community in an eastern university were monitored prospectively to identify acute respiratory infection (ari) cases using questionnaires and rt-qpcr, so as to characterize contagious phenotypes including social connections, built environment, and immunologic phenotypes 8 . from among de-identified blood specimens for which future research use authorization was obtained, five specimens that showed high igg reactivity against human coronaviruses in the larger study were chosen for validation of the coronavirus antigen microarray.the coronavirus antigen microarray used in this investigation includes 67 antigens across subtypes expressed in either baculovirus or hek-293 cells (see tables 1-3) . these antigens were provided by sino biological inc. (wayne, pa) as either catalog products, or service products. the antigens were printed onto microarrays, probed with human sera, and analyzed as previously described ( figure 1 ) 6, 9, 10 . briefly, lyophilized antigens were reconstituted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) with 0.001% tween-20 (t-pbs) and then printed onto nitrocellulose-coated slides from grace bio labs (gbl, bend, or) using an omnigrid 100 microarray printer (genemachines). the microarray slides were probed with human sera diluted 1:100 in 1x gvs fast blocking buffer (fischer scientific) overnight at 4°c, washed with t-tbs buffer (20 mm tris-hcl, 150 mm nacl, 0.05% tween-20 in ddh2o adjusted to ph 7.5 and filtered) 3 times for 5 minutes each, labeled with secondary antibodies to human igg conjugated to quantum dot fluorophore for 2 hours at room temperature, and then washed with t-tbs 3 times for 5 minutes each and dried. the slides were imaged using arraycam imager (grace bio labs, bend, or) to measure background-subtracted median spot fluorescence. non-specific binding of secondary antibodies was subtracted using saline control. mean fluorescence of the 4 replicate spots for each antigen was used for analysis.descriptive statistics were used to summarize the igg reactivity as measured by mean fluorescence across antigen replicates. t-test or f-test were used to test for the mean differences in continuous variables across infection groups. all statistical analyses were conducted using r version 3.5.1 (r foundation for statistical computing, vienna, austria).overall, the 5 sera tested on the coronavirus antigen microarray all showed high igg seroreactivity to antigens from common human coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses with known seasonal circulation versus low igg seroreactivity to antigens from epidemic viruses that were not circulating at time of collection ( figure 2) . specifically, 4 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity across the 4 common human coronaviruses, while all of the sera showed low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2, sars-cov, and mers-cov. all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to rsv and parainfluenza viruses, while 3 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to adenoviruses. for influenza, all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to h1n1 and h3n2 influenza a and influenza b strains but low igg seroreactivity to h5n1 and h7n9 influenza a strains. with respect to specific antigens, the s1 domain of the spike protein including the receptor-binding domain (rbd) demonstrates very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses, whereas the s2 domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein (np) show low-level cross-reactivity between these coronavirus subtypes. similarly, the head domain of influenza hemagglutinin (ha1) is not cross-reactive between seasonal and avian influenza strains, whereas the stalk domain (ha2) is cross-reactive between influenza virus subgroups, as seen between h1n1 and h5n1 influenza viruses.this pilot study yields several insights into cross-reactivity of common human coronavirus antibodies for sars-cov-2 antigens. the antibodies to the s1 and rbd domains of spike protein are highly subtype-specific, consistent with the high variability in these sequences between different human coronaviruses. conversely, the s2 domain of spike protein and np protein are more cross-reactive, consistent with these sequences being highly conserved across coronaviruses. sars-cov-2 has caused a worldwide pandemic despite likely pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies to s2 domain and np protein in most people, indicating that these antibodies are likely not protective, whereas antibodies to s1 and rbd domains are more likely to be protective. this observation favors a vaccination strategy based on s1 or rbd domains of spike protein over a vaccination strategy that also includes s2 domain or np protein. in addition, s1 and rbd domains are more likely to generate subtype-specific serologic tests for population surveillance studies. in addition, a key unexplained finding during the sars-cov-2 epidemic has been the low incidence of infection in children aged 15 and younger. this observation generates two related hypotheses: adults may have pre-existing antibodies against antigenically distinct coronaviruses that produce an ineffective humoral response to sars-cov-2 infection (antibody-dependent enhancement as demonstrated for dengue virus), or children younger than 15 may have initially encountered a coronavirus that is more closely related to sars-cov-2 so are more protected against this infection (immunologic imprinting or original antigenic sin as demonstrated for influenza virus). both of these hypotheses would be informed by comparing the level of cross-reactive coronavirus antibodies in pediatric and adult cohorts and correlating these antibodies with incidence of severe disease.a coronavirus antigen microarray has been constructed with antigens from epidemic coronaviruses including sars-cov-2 and common human coronaviruses, in addition to other common respiratory viruses. a pilot study of 5 naïve human sera shows high igg seroreactivity to common human coronaviruses but low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2, with some cross-reactivity seen for s2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. further studies are needed including with sars-cov-2 convalescent sera to fully realize the potential of this novel methodology to characterize the seroprevalence of sars-cov-2 and the impact of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies on the disease course. the 2019 novel coronavirus strain (sars-cov-2) originating in wuhan, china has become a worldwide pandemic with significant morbidity and mortality estimates up to 2% of confirmed cases. the current case definition for confirmed covid-19 due to sars-cov-2 infection relies on pcr-positive

holder for this preprint this version posted march 25, 2020. . while all of the sera showed low igg seroreactivity to sars-cov-2, sars-cov, and mers-cov. all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to rsv and parainfluenza viruses, while 3 of the 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to adenoviruses. for influenza, all 5 sera showed high igg seroreactivity to h1n1 and h3n2 influenza a and influenza b strains but low igg seroreactivity to h5n1 and h7n9 influenza a strains. with respect to specific antigens, the s1 domain of the spike protein including the receptor-binding domain (rbd) demonstrates very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses, whereas the s2 domain of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein (np) show low-level

infections especially among children, older adults, and immunosuppressed persons [1, 2] . hmpv is an antisense single-stranded rna virus that belongs to the new virus family pneumoviridae [3] . phylogenetic analysis of the f and g genes has shown that hmpv can be classified into 2 main antigenic subtypes, a and b, with each subtype further separated into genetic sublineages (a1/a2a/a2b and b1/b2) [4] . it is known that the 2 main subgroups circulate in all parts of the world and concurrent annual circulation is common for all hmpv sublineages, with predominant hmpv subtype switching each year [5, 6] .the clinical manifestations of hmpv infections range from asymptomatic carriage to severe disease including fatal cases [2] . because of its genetic diversity, previous studies have attempted to associate hmpv subtypes with clinical characteristics. some studies found that the different clinical characteristics of hmpv infection might be associated with hmpv genotype and that disease severity could be increased with specific hmpv subgroup infections [7, 8] . however, it was also reported that there is no relationship between hmpv sublineages and the severity of illness or clinical manifestations [9, 10] . therefore, whether there is an association between hmpv genotypes and clinical characteristics is debatable.the association between climatic factors and hmpv infections is also unclear. some researchers have assumed that most hmpv infections in humans would occur with strong seasonal predominance patterns [11, 12] . however, the seasonality of hmpv is not fully understood, and there is still very little information available regarding the association between meteorological parameters and hmpv activity.here, we conducted a long-term surveillance study of hmpv in south korea from january 2007 to december 2016. the aim was to compare clinical characteristics including symptoms, diagnoses, laboratory findings, and concurrent pathogen infections and to evaluate the seasonal dynamics of hmpv infections according to hmpv subtypes. additionally, we investigated the climatic factors that would explain the seasonal prevalence of hmpv infections in south korea.among the hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness, 1275 were diagnosed with hmpv infection. we reviewed the medical records for patients with hmpv infection, and the following clinical data were obtained: basic patient characteristics, past medical history, symptoms, and physical examination findings. in addition, we collected the results of routine laboratory testing upon admission. the following analytes were included in admission tests: sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorous, glucose, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, γ-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, c-reactive protein, and complete blood cell results. the results of arterial blood gas analysis (n = 458) and procalcitonin (n = 123) were collected when available. to determine the presence of other bacterial and viral infections, we also reviewed various bacterial and tuberculosis culture test results for any specimen, antigen testing (streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza a and b, rsv, rotavirus, norovirus), antibody testing (mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus), and molecular tests for respiratory bacterial pathogens (s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, chlamydophila pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, bordetella pertussis, m. pneumoniae, tuberculosis, and nontuberculous mycobacteria), respiratory viral pathogens, and diarrhea viruses (rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, and astrovirus).meteorological data between january 2007 and december 2016 were collected from the database of the korea meteorological administration (kma; https://data.kma.go.kr/). the surface observation for the kma was conducted by the seoul automated synoptic observing system (asos station 108), and the 16 meteorological elements, including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure, among others, were measured every 3 hours [13] .a total of 1275 hmpv-positive samples based on respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were analyzed by nested pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis, as described previously [14, 15] . the nested pcr was conducted with 2 primer-probe sets targeting the hmpv fusion (f) gene. outer primers targeted 450 bp of the f gene, and inner primers were designed to detect 348 bp of the first pcr products. after amplification, pcr-amplified fragments were digested with 10 units of restriction enzyme (tsp509i, thermo fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pennsylvania) for 16 hours at 65°c and electrophoresed.for the samples that showed negative results or unknown band patterns by rflp analysis, pcr products were directly sequenced using the inner primer set employed for the nested pcr step. target nucleotides were analyzed using an abi prism 3730xl genetic analyzer (applied biosystems, foster city, california), and the sequences were compared for similarity based on the genbank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/genbank/).datasets were entered into microsoft excel (microsoft, washington) and analyzed using r version 3.5.1 (http://www.rproject.org/). for clinical characteristics and laboratory findings, the values were presented as median with interquartile range (continuous variables) or count with percentage (binomial or categorical variables). the fisher exact test was used to compare differences between binomial variables. continuous variables were compared by the kruskal-wallis test, and post hoc tests were performed using the dunn multiple comparisons test. associations between hmpv-positive rates and climate factors were explored by univariate regression analysis based on the pearson correlation coefficient. independent associations were analyzed by the multiple linear regression model using the stepwise selection method. a p value <.05 was considered a significant difference. we also utilized principal components analysis (pca) to determine the contribution of climate variables to hmpv infections. using pca, we could reduce highdimensional data spaces (1 axis per meteorological variable) to 2-dimensional planes for further analysis [16, 17] . based on the results of pca, we could select dominant climate factors that affect hmpv infections, and 2-dimensional density plots were generated to evaluate the impact of climate factors in hmpv infections.during the study period, 23 694 patients were subjected to molecular testing for respiratory viruses, and 13 871 patients (58.5%) were positive for at least 1 respiratory virus including the following: 3631 cases of rhinovirus (15.3%), 3482 rsv (14.7%), 2652 adenovirus (11.2%), 1842 piv (7.8%), 1275 hmpv (5.4%), 1223 influenza a (5.2%), 1017 enterovirus (4.3%), 719 influenza b (3.0%), 703 bocavirus (3.0%), and 539 coronavirus (2.3%).the rate of positivity and weekly distribution of hmpv infections are shown in figure 1a . these rates for hmpv infections varied from 0% to 21.1% across the weeks. significant increases in isolation rates occurred between 10 and 25 weeks, and half of the hmpv infections occurred between 13 and 20 weeks (april and may). of the hmpv-positive specimens, 1199 (94.0%) were subtyped as follows: 570 (44.7%) hmpv a2a, 304 (23.8%) hmpv b1, 279 (21.9%) hmpv b2, 21 (1.6%) hmpv a2b, and 24 (1.9%) mixed-genotype infections. only 1 patient was infected with hmpv a1 (0.1%). among mixed-genotype infections, 12 were hmpv a2a/b1 infections, 9 were hmpv a2a/b2, and 3 were hmpv a2a/b2. specimens from 76 patients could not be genotyped (not determined). the dominant hmpv genotype in peak season was hmpv a2a, and the relative frequencies of hmpv b1 and b2 increased in the winter season ( figure 1b) . however, the annual predominance patterns across the study period were complex and unpredictable ( figure 1c ).the clinical characteristics of hmpv infections in pediatric and adult patients are summarized in tables 1 and 2. the majority of patients with hmpv were children (1200/1275 [94.1%]). further, clinical manifestations were similar between the pediatric and adult patient groups. most individuals infected with this virus exhibited upper respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever, sputum, and rhinorrhea, and the median onset of symptoms was 3 days. in both groups, pneumonia was the most common clinical diagnosis associated with hmpv infections. for the pediatric group, all hospitalized patients showed good prognosis and the median length of hospitalization was 5 days. however, a mortality rate of 9.3% was observed in the adult patient group. most clinical characteristics were not significantly different between hmpv subtypes. in the pediatric group, however, there were significant differences among hmpv subtypes and clinical manifestations (cough, seizure, abdominal pain, and rhonchi) and concurrent infections (m. pneumoniae, adenovirus, and enterovirus). in terms of hmpv subtype infections, there was no significant difference in laboratory findings between children and adults (supplementary tables 1 and 2 ).the meteorological characteristics associated with hmpv infections are shown in table 3 . comparing 4 hmpv genotypes, the p values associated with the mean temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, ground surface temperature, and relative humidity were all <.05. specifically, the isolation of hmpv genotype a2a occurred more frequently with higher temperatures and wet weather, whereas hmpv b2 was frequently isolated with relatively low temperatures and dry environments. figure 2 shows annual variations in the rates of hmpv positivity and climatic variables. the intervals between 13 and 20 weeks are marked with orange boxes, and more than half of the infections occurred during these intervals. as shown in table 4 , diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and sunshine duration were directly correlated with rates of positivity based on univariate regression analyses. when the correlations were further analyzed by multivariate regression analysis, diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration were found to be independent associative factors.results of pca of hmpv infection cases indicated that the first principal component could explain 52.0%-55.8% of the total variances (supplementary table 3 and supplementary figure 1 ). the most important contributors to the first principal component were temperature variables including mean, minimum, maximum, and ground surface temperatures. the second principal component, which was dominated by diurnal temperature variation and relative humidity, could explain about 20% of the total variances. the third principal component was dominated by wind speed, which explained approximately 10% of the total variances. from the pca results, we could assume that temperature, relative humidity, and diurnal temperature variation were the significant climatic factors associated with hmpv infections.density plots were created to visualize the relationships between climate factors and hmpv infections (supplementary figure 2 ). mean temperature with diurnal temperature variation and relative humidity were selected to generate the density plots. most hmpv infections occurred at a temperature interval of 8°c-22°c, a diurnal temperature difference between 6°c and 14 °c, and a relative humidity interval of 40%-60%.in our study, hmpv was detected in 5.4% of respiratory specimens and was the fifth most commonly isolated respiratory virus. hmpv infections occurred more frequently in children, and a seasonal peak was found to be prominent in the spring season. these results were consistent with previous reports conducted in south korea [6, 18, 19] .the hmpv subtypes a2a, a2b, b1, and b2 co-circulated throughout the study period, and the annual predominant genotypes were hmpv a2a in 2007, 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2016; b1 in 2011 and 2012; and b2 in 2008 and 2009. hmpv genotype predominance was thus observed both for 1 year and a maximum of 3 consecutive years, whereas the predominant genotype changed every 3-4 years. however, there were no regular cyclic patterns of predominant hmpv genotypes throughout our study period. this circulation complexity was also found in long-term studies from the united states and germany [11, 20] . in addition, we could not find any similarities in annual predominance patterns between our study and other studies conducted in neighboring counties including china and japan [21] [22] [23] . these results suggest that the varying annual predominance of hmpv subtypes/genotypes is a local phenomenon, and not synchronized across a wide geographic region [11] .the clinical features of hmpv infections in our study were consistent with those described in previous reports [9, 21] . pediatric patients with hmpv infection showed mild respiratory symptoms before 2-5 days of hospitalization. most inpatient children were diagnosed with pneumonia and stayed in the hospital for 4-6 days. hmpv infections seemed to cause more severe illness in adult patients; however, it was difficult to draw a conclusion with these results because the proportion of .8932 . adult patients was too small and more severe cases were more likely to be tested in the adult patient group. various studies have focused on the correlation between hmpv subtypes and clinical characteristics in infected patients. vicente et al found that the clinical severity of hmpv a infections was higher than that of hmpv b infections [8] . matsuzaki et al indicated that laryngitis was more associated with hmpv b1 infections, whereas wheezing was more prevalent with hmpv b1 and b2 infections [7] . however, there were also many reports suggesting that there are no differences in clinical characteristics caused by various hmpv subtypes [9, 10, 21] . in our study, according to hmpv subtypes, statistical significance was found in terms of symptoms, physical examination findings, and concurrent infections in pediatric patients. however, we found that there were no distinct differences in clinical diagnoses, clinical outcomes, and laboratory findings according to hmpv genotypes. these results support the contentions that certain clinical manifestations are different among hmpv genotypes but that there is no significant relationship between the hmpv subtype and disease severity.we also attempted to assess the effects of meteorological factors on hmpv infections. hmpv activity was affected by temperature variables, relative humidity, diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. among these factors, the rate of hmpv positivity was positively correlated with 3 variables including diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. our results also showed peaks of hmpv activity at temperatures of approximately 13.5°c and relative humidity of 55.0%; furthermore, this activity tended to be associated with increasing diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. previous studies conducted in other regions suggested that low temperature is the main driver of hmpv seasonality [11, [24] [25] [26] . however, based on the results of our study, we could not conclude that temperature variables are not linearly correlated with hmpv epidemics. because the climate of seoul is characterized by large seasonal temperature differences, which are not observed in previously studied countries, we hypothesized that hmpv would not be prevalent at low temperatures but would be prevalent at a certain temperature interval. in addition, the amount of rainfall was found to be correlated with the incidence of hmpv infections in subtropical and tropical regions [27] [28] [29] , whereas hmpv activity was not affected by rainfall in our study. these findings suggest that hmpv infections were affected by climate factors, but that the meteorological drivers of virus activity vary by region and climate group [11, 24] .we also investigated differences in environmental factors that affect the transmission of each hmpv genotype. our study showed that adaptation to climatic conditions, with respect to the occurrence of human cases of hmpv subgroups, was slightly different. for example, hmpv b2 infections appeared when the temperature was colder, whereas hmpv a2a infections were more prevalent in milder weather with a more humid environment. however, the origins of these differences in adaptation to meteorological conditions among hmpv subtypes were not clear, and further research should be performed to elucidate the link between the transmission abilities of hmpv subgroups and climatic factors.although we attempted to minimize errors, there were several limitations to this study. first, 6% of hmpv-positive specimens could not be genotyped due to sample problems such as deficiencies and rna degradation after long-term storage. although the proportion of "not determined" specimens was not relatively large, it could have affected the results of our study. second, the clinical information of hmpv-positive patients was only tracked by medical records due to the nature of our retrospective study. we admit that some information could be misrepresented or omitted, and this possibility could also affect the results of this study. third, because respiratory molecular testing was routinely used only for pediatric patients, and not for adult patients, the study population was biased for pediatric patients and the number of adult patients was relatively insufficient. therefore, further long-term prospective surveillance should be performed to solve the present limitations and provide more informative results regarding hmpv infections.in conclusion, our study provides long-term data on hmpv infections from a tertiary hospital serving a south korean population. hmpv was the fifth most isolated respiratory virus and patients of various ages were infected, mainly between weeks 13 and 20 (april and may). among the 5 subtypes of hmpv, hmpv a2a was most frequently isolated and each hmpv subtype showed annual predominance every 3-4 years. there were also significant differences between hmpv genotypes and clinical characteristics; however, disease severity was not altered according to hmpv subtype. our study also showed that hmpv infections occurred with a seasonal rhythm and were associated with several climate factors including temperature, relative humidity, diurnal temperature variation, wind speed, and sunshine duration. in addition, each hmpv genotype had a different affinity for certain meteorological conditions. the results of our study contribute to the understanding of the clinical characteristics of infections caused by each hmpv subtype, as well as climate factors that contribute to the transmission of hmpv.supplementary materials are available at clinical infectious diseases online. consisting of data provided by the authors

diarrhea virus (bvdv) is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded rna genome, which belongs to the genus pestivirus, family flaviviridae, and is distributed worldwide [1] . bvdv causes significant economic losses to the dairy and beef livestock industries, which are attributed to morbidity, mortality, growth retardation, reduced milk production, premature culling, reduced reproductive performance, and increased occurrences of other diseases [2, 3] . the two currently recognized bvdv species are bvdv-1 and bvdv-2, and they were recently renamed pestivirus a and b, respectively [4, 5] . bvdv-1 is the most genetically diverse, with 21 subtypes (bvdv-1a through u) currently recognized, while 4 subtypes (a-d) have been described for bvdv-2 [6] [7] [8] [9] . more recently, the pestivirus hobi-like virus has been proposed as a new bvdv species (bvdv-3 or pestivirus h) based on antigenic and genetic similarities [4, 5, 10, 11] .clinical outcomes of bvdv infection include (a) transient or acute infection with subclinical, respiratory, and/or severe digestive clinical manifestation characterized by high morbidity and variable mortality and generally associated with noncytopathic (ncp) viral strains; (b) reproductive infections, including oocyte/sperm infections that negatively affect fertility, or transplacental/congenital transmission that may result in embryonic or fetal death; mummification; abortion; congenital anomalies; stillbirths; or, if the fetus survives, the birth of persistently infected (pi) calves, particularly when the fetuses are infected by ncp strains before 4 months of gestation; and (c) mucosal disease (md) characterized by low morbidity and very high lethality in pi animals, usually before 2 years of age. md is associated with superinfection with a cytopathic (cp) biotype that can arise through mutation, recombination, or genomic rearrangements of the ncp viral strain that infects pi cattle [12, 13] .as viruses with worldwide distribution [9] , bvdv-1 and bvdv-2 have been recognized for many years in south american countries, including brazil [14] , argentina [15] , colombia [16] , peru, chile [17] , and uruguay [18] , while the pestivirus hobi-like virus has currently only been identified in argentina [19] and brazil [20] on this subcontinent. in uruguay, the first evidence of bvdv circulation dates from 1996 [21] . a serological study revealed that bvdv exposure is widespread in beef cattle throughout uruguay [22] . more recently, active bvdv infections and circulating species and subtypes were explored in cattle herds with reproductive problems, and bvdv-1a was revealed as the predominant species/ subtype, followed by bvdv-1i and bvdv-2b [18] .clinicopathological descriptions of bvdv-associated diseases in uruguay and the impact of these diseases on bovine production systems in the country are lacking in the scientific literature. recognizing and identifying these diseases in spontaneous field outbreaks is essential for establishing control programs to reduce their economic impacts at the herd and national levels. this work describes the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, and virological findings in spontaneous disease outbreaks associated with bvdv infections in cattle in uruguay.eight natural cases of bvdv-associated diseases (cases 1-8) during six outbreaks (outbreaks 1-6) in commercial beef and dairy herds in uruguay are described. cases were diagnosed between november 2016 and april 2018 at inia's veterinary diagnostic laboratory (animal health platform) in la estanzuela, colonia department, uruguay. carcasses of the deceased cattle in cases 1-8 were provided for necropsy by veterinary practitioners and farmers. additionally, in cases 1 and 6, serum samples collected prior to death by the veterinary practitioners were made available for testing. epidemiological and clinical information was gathered for each outbreak when available.necropsy, histology, and immunohistochemistry all 8 cattle died spontaneously at commercial farms and were subsequently necropsied. tissue samples were collected, preserved frozen at -20°c for virology, and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h. fixed tissues were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4-5 μm, mounted on glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histological examination under an optic microscope (axioscope.a1, carl-zeiss, germany).selected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) sections of various tissues from all cases were processed for immunohistochemistry (ihc) to detect pestivirus antigen using a standard operating procedure kindly provided by jan shivers from the university of minnesota veterinary diagnostic laboratory. briefly, heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed by placing the deparaffinized sections in a decloaking chamber (biocare medical) at 110°c for 30 s. a commercially available anti-bvdv monoclonal antibody isotype igg 2a produced in mice (catalogue d89, vmrd, pullman, wa, usa) was applied as the primary antibody for 45 min at a 1:20 dilution. an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (hrp)labeled polymer (envision+ hrp goat anti-mouse igg, k4001, dako) was used as the detection system, with 3amino-9-ethylcarbazole (aec no. 3469, dako) as the substrate chromogen. a ffpe section of archived intestine from a naturally infected calf that tested positive for bvdv by rt-pcr and ihc was used as a positive control. for the negative controls, serial sections of all tested tissues were processed in parallel as described above, but the primary antibody was replaced with normal mouse serum (nc499l, biocare medical) at the same dilution.nucleic acids were extracted from frozen serum or tissue samples in all cases using the qiaamp® cador® pathogen mini kit (qiagen®, germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. reverse transcription (rt) was performed using random primers and super-script ii enzyme (invitrogen®, usa). real-time pcr assays targeting a 207-bp fragment of the 5′utr region of the bvdv were performed using the primers bvdv190f and v326, and the taq-man® probe tq-pesti as described by hoffman et al. [23] and gaede et al. [24] , respectively, and later modified by maya et al. [18] , to detect bvdv-1, bvdv-2, and the hobi-like pestivirus. all real-time pcrs were performed using the sensimixtm ii probe kit (bioline reagents ltd.) and a rotor-gene q instrument (qiagen®) following the manufacturer's recommendations.on all real-time pcr-positive samples, a 207-bp fragment of the 5′utr was amplified by conventional pcr, using the same primer pair used for the real-time pcr. the amplicons were sequenced at macrogen, inc. (seoul, south korea) in an abi3730xl genetic analyzer (applied biosystems, ca, usa). the sequences were edited using seqman software (dnastar lasergene) and deposited in the genbank database. species and subtype assignment were done by phylogenetic analysis of uruguayan 5′utr sequences, along with representative bvdv-1, bvdv-2, and hobi-like pestivirus strains retrieved from the genbank. nucleotide sequences were aligned using clustal w implemented in mega 6.06 software [25] . the model of nucleotide substitution that best fit the dataset (kimura 2 parameters + gamma) was selected using the jmodeltest program according to the akaike information criterion (aic; akaike, 1974) [26] . a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining (nj) method, and statistical significance bootstrap method was carried out (1000 replicates) using mega 6.06 version [25] .diagnostic investigations in each case also involved performing specific bacteriological, virological, serological, and molecular laboratory tests to assess for other pathogens, based on the presumptive clinical and pathological diagnoses in each case. online resource 1 summarizes the ancillary diagnostic tests performed on each of the 8 necropsied cattle. table 1 summarizes the information on the disease diagnoses, date of diagnosis confirmation, herd geographic location, breed, production class, age, and the bvdv species/ subtypes identified in all 8 cases, and whether cattle from other farms had been recently introduced to the affected herds. additional epidemiological, clinical, and pathological information on each case/outbreak and interpretation of the ancillary and diagnostic test results (online resource 1) are provided below.outbreak 1 outbreak 1 occurred in a herd of 340 rotationally grazing aberdeen angus heifers in a commercial breeding herd. twelve heifers died sporadically from september to november 2016 (mortality 3.5%). clinical examination of an 18-month-old heifer (case 1) revealed tachypnea (120 breaths/minute), tachycardia (48 beats/minute), a rectal temperature of 39.5°c (normothermia), ruminal atony, foulsmelling diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss. the animal died spontaneously after a 96-h clinical course.the necropsy revealed multiple irregular, well-defined erosions and nonperforating ulcers up to 0.5 cm in the mucosa of the thoracic region of the esophagus (fig. 1a) , petechiae, and ecchymosis in the jejunal serosa, with brown, bloody, fluid, foul-smelling contents in the jejunum, cecum, and colon. diffusely, the colonic mucosa was markedly reddened, with brown viscous contents and clotted blood adhered to the surface (hemorrhagic colitis) (fig. 1b) .microscopically, there was multifocal necrotizing ulcerative esophagitis ( fig. 1c) with microthrombosis in the submucosa and individual keratinocyte necrosis/apoptosis, multifocal superficial rumenitis and reticulitis with swelling and hydropic keratinocyte degeneration, and neutrophil transmigration in the epithelium. severe extensive necrotizing enterotyphlocolitis with submucosal edema, microthrombosis in the lamina propria, and neutrophilic cryptitis with necrotic enterocytes was also observed. ihc for bvdv antigen detection revealed abundant, strong and frequent intralesional, finely granular, and homogeneous immunolabeling in the cytoplasm of the epithelial (keratinocytes and enterocytes) and inflammatory cells in the esophagus (fig. 1d ), small intestine, and colon.the bvdv genome was detected in the serum via rt-qpcr (ct 27.70), and bvdv-1a was further identified by sequencing the 5′utr genomic region (genbank mn159214). mucosal disease was diagnosed based on these results (table 1) , while other causes of enterocolitis in cattle, including salmonella spp. and bovine coronavirus, were ruled out by specific testing (see online resource 1).outbreak 2 outbreak 2 occurred at a dairy herd of 1222 holstein cattle, including 580 milking cows, 40 dry cows, 200 heifers, 400 calves, and 2 bulls. of 533 pregnant cows/ heifers aged 2 to 7 years, 16% aborted between 4 and 8 months of gestation. a male fetus (case 2) that had been aborted at approximately 240 gestational days by a 5.5-yearold cow was necropsied.the only macroscopic lesion was mild pleural petechiation in the right lung. histology revealed multifocal moderate necrotizing lymphocytic/histiocytic encephalitis with gliosis, multifocal moderate-to-severe lymphocytic and histiocytic myocarditis, and multifocal minimal lymphocytic and histiocytic glossitis. as shown in online resource 1, an ihc procedure for detecting neospora caninum antigen revealed intralesional immunolabeling in the fetal encephalon and heart. the protozoan's genome was detected by pcr on a frozen brain sample. based on these results, an etiological diagnosis of encephalitis and myocarditis caused by n. caninum was reached. however, the bvdv genome was detected by rt-qpcr (ct 27.37) from a pool of fetal tissues and further identified as bvdv-1a (genbank mn159211). ihc immunolabeling for bvdv antigen was negative for all fetal tissues analyzed using this technique (brain, kidney, lung, spleen, and liver), suggesting an acute/transient bvdv infection rather than a pi fetus (table 1) .outbreak 3 outbreak 3 occurred on a farm dedicated to rearing dairy calves/heifers brought from various farms in different departments of uruguay. a respiratory disease outbreak was registered in a group of approximately 200 heifers aged 3 to 4 months that had been brought to the farm approximately 30 days earlier. the respiratory disease outbreak started in 20 calves (10%) 15 days after admission, and 5 days later, approximately 80 animals (40%) were affected. morbidity and mortality rates were 80% and 7.5% (15 heifers), respectively.two heifers were necropsied (cases 3 and 4). the pathological findings in case 3 included diffuse moderate fibrinous histiocytic and neutrophilic interstitial pneumonia with necrotizing bronchiolitis, multifocal neutrophilic alveolitis, and microthrombosis with multifocal pleuritis. multifocally, the lungs and kidneys showed segmental lymphohistiocytic and necrotizing vasculitis affecting the medium-sized arterioles (fig. 2a) . additionally, there was moderate multifocal erosive typhlocolitis with necrotizing cryptitis, with inflammatory infiltrate extended to the submucosa, along with fibrinous mesenteric lymphadenitis and moderate multifocal lymphocytic and neutrophilic abomasitis. mild diffuse portal lymphocytic, histiocytic, and neutrophilic hepatitis with cholestasis in the bile ducts and minimal multifocal random necrotizing histiocytic and neutrophilic hepatitis throughout the parenchyma were also observed.salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium was isolated from the mesenteric lymph node and intestines, while bovine coronavirus and several viruses causing pneumonia were ruled out (see online resource 1). bvdv was identified via rt-qpcr (ct 27.35) from a pool of frozen tissues and characterized as bvdv-2b by sequencing (genbank mn159205). ihc for bvdv antigen detection in the lung revealed finely granular, homogenous, and focal immunolabeling in the cytoplasm of smooth muscle and endothelial cells from an arteriole affected by arteriolitis and infiltrating macrophages (fig.  2b) . no immunolabeling occurred in the kidney, small intestine, colon, or liver tissues. based on these results, we diagnosed septicemic salmonellosis in coinfection with bvdv-2b (table 1) , which was detected by ihc within the arteriolar lesions in the lung and was thus suspected to have caused the arteriolitis.case 4 from the same outbreak had pathological findings i n c l u d i n g s e v e r e e x t e n s i v e f i b r i n o s u p p u r a t i v e bronchopneumonia involving approximately 70% of the pulmonary parenchyma and fibrinous pleuritis. the tongue showed multifocal necrosis of the basal keratinocyte layer in the mucosa and multifocal apoptosis of individual keratinocytes in the esophagus and rumen.histophilus somni was isolated from the lung, and viral causes of pneumonia were ruled out (online resource 1). bvdv was identified in a frozen sample of pooled tissues by rt-qpcr (ct 26.08), and genome sequencing revealed the same subtype as in case 3 of this outbreak (genbank mn159204). ihc for bvdv antigen revealed focal intralesional immunolabeling in the basal mucosal epithelium of the tongue, in the cytoplasm of the endothelial and muscular cells of blood vessels in the lungs and in macrophages infiltrating the pleura and interstitium. no immunolabeling was found in the kidney, lymph node, heart, intestinal, or rumen tissues. h. somni bronchopneumonia was diagnosed (table 1) in coinfection with bvdv-2b that was detected by ihc in the pulmonary and lingual lesions.outbreak 4 outbreak 4 occurred in a feedlot with approximately 300 beef cattle from different origins. an approximately 2-year-old beef steer of undetermined breed (case 5) presented inappetence and stopped drinking water. antibiotic treatment (penicillin g procaine and dihydrostreptomycin) was administered for 5 days; however, the steer died after a 10-day clinical course. within 6 months, two other steers with similar clinical presentations died, yielding a 1% mortality rate.a partial necropsy was performed by the veterinary practitioner, and some organs, including the kidney, heart, liver, urinary bladder, and small and large intestines, were submitted to the diagnostic laboratory. pathological findings in the kidneys included extensive cortical coagulative necrosis (renal infarcts) (fig. 3a) and occasional necrotizing segmental arteriolitis with thrombosis (fig. 3b) . severe acute/subacute transmural necrotizing, fibrinosuppurative, and hemorrhagic urocystitis with thrombosis and individual necrosis of arteriolar leiomyocytes was also present. in addition, focal acute mild colitis with necrotizing cryptitis was observed.bvdv was detected by rt-qpcr (ct 34.04) from the frozen tissue pool and further identified as bvdv-1a via sequencing (genbank mn159221). ihc for bvdv antigen detection showed multifocal and infrequent cytoplasmic immunolabeling in macrophages infiltrating the urinary bladder mucosa; no labeling was seen in any other analyzed tissues fig. 1 pathological findings in an aberdeen angus heifer with mucosal disease caused by bvdv-1a (case 1). a the mucosa of the esophagus shows multiple, coalescing, irregular, well-defined erosions and nonperforating ulcers (ulcerative esophagitis), some of which have a hemorrhagic halo. b the colonic mucosa is markedly reddened, necrotic, and ulcerated and

antigen immunolabeling in the esophageal mucosa adjacent to the ulcer bed (liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and colon). additionally, in this case, streptococcus sp. was isolated from the kidney, and escherichia coli was isolated from the kidney, urinary bladder, and liver (online resource 1). these were considered potential opportunistic secondary pathogens. because bvdv ihc was negative in multiple tissues except the bladder, an acute/transient bvdv-1a infection was suspected.outbreak 5 outbreak 5 occurred at a calf-rearing and steerfattening operation, with 708 cattle of different breeds and origins. between january and april 2018, 12 holstein steers (1.7%) presented emaciation, anorexia, isolation, and diarrhea and died after a 1-month clinical course. an approximately 4-year-old holstein steer (case 6) in poor-body condition was necropsied.the pathological examination revealed a chronic enteropathy affecting the ileum and colon, characterized by depletion of intestinal glands/crypts in the mucosa, occasional neutrophilic/necrotizing cryptitis, and infrequent intraepithelial coccidia, morphologically compatible with eimeira spp. additionally, multifocal, moderate, chronic, lymphocytic interstitial nephritis was observed as well as moderate pleuritis with pleural fibrosis and fibrosing interstitial pneumonia and moderate suppurative lymphadenitis of undetermined etiology.ihc for bvdv revealed strong and abundant finely granular and homogeneous intracytoplasmic immunolabeling in the epithelial cells, which was diffuse throughout all examined tissues (lung, intestines, liver, and kidney). bvdv was detected in the serum by rt-qpcr (ct 28.75), and bvdv-1a was identified by sequencing (genbank mn186041). other causes of enterocolitis were ruled out, including salmonella spp., mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, bovine coronavirus, and group a rotavirus (online resource 1). based on the overall results, this was likely either a pi calf with bvdv-1a or a severe transient infection.outbreak 6 outbreak 6 occurred at a dairy farm of unknown herd size, where an increased abortion rate was registered.two aborted holstein fetuses (cases 7 and 8) of approximately 180-210 gestational days were necropsied. for case 7, the diagnostic investigation did not allow determining the cause of the abortion because the fetus presented no lesions, and all ancillary diagnostic tests were negative (online resource 1) except the rt-qpcr for bvdv (ct 32.17), which was positive from a pool of fetal tissues.in case 8, the histological examination revealed moderate multifocal lymphohistiocytic necrotizing encephalitis, severe random multifocal necrotizing hepatitis, moderate multifocal lymphocytic myocarditis, and multifocal lymphohistiocytic placentitis with trophoblast necrosis. all lesions were highly compatible with neosporosis. neospora caninum was detected intralesionally by ihc in the brain and by pcr in the same tissue (online resource 1). bvdv was detected by rt-qpcr (ct 33.90) from the pool of fetal tissues.bvdv-2b was identified in both fetuses by sequencing (genbank mn186039 and mn186040). ihc for bvdv antigen detection was negative in tissues from both fetuses, including the brain, lung, and spleen in case 7 and the brain, kidney, liver, and spleen in case 8. based on these results, acute/transient bvdv infections, rather than pi, were suspected in both cases (table 1) .as shown in fig. 4 , the phylogenetic analysis revealed that 4 of the strains were bvdv-1a and the other 4 bvdv-2b with bootstrap values of 71% and 63%, respectively.the diagnoses of bvdv infection in 8 cases reported here were based on viral genome detection by rt-qpcr along with detailed pathological examinations to characterize the lesions and ihc to identify bvdv antigen in the tissues of the the clinical signs and pathological findings in the heifer from outbreak 1 were those typically described in the literature for md cases [13, 27] . detection of the viral genome and the colocalization of bvdv antigen intralesionally by ihc confirmed the etiological diagnosis, while other causes of necrotizing colitis, such as salmonella spp. and bovine coronavirus, were ruled out [13] .the occurrence of md requires the presence of pi animals congenitally infected with bvdv, which are the main source of infections in the herds. pi cattle are viremic, lifelong viral shedders, and immunotolerant to the ncp strain with which they are infected because their immune systems do not recognize the bvdv antigens as foreign, thus leading to extensive viral replication in the target cells [13, 27] . in our case, viremia was confirmed by identifying bvdv-1a in the serum, while ihc allowed detecting abundant viral antigen in the alimentary tract tissues (esophagus, small, and large intestines), which showed typical md lesions. md occurs in pi animals when the ncp bvdv strain is converted to the cytopathic biotype via mutation, recombination, and/or genomic rearrangements. generally, the ns2/3 viral protease containing the ncp strain is cleaved to ns2 and ns3 in the cytopathic strains [12, 28] . this results in a devastating infection that destroys the host cells, to which the animal's immune system cannot respond [13] .pi neonate calves may be clinically normal, weak, born smaller than normal, or show growth retardation; however, most die of md before 2 years of age [12, 13] , which is the same age range of the heifer with md in case 1. the 4-yearold steer in outbreak 5 (case 6) presented severe intestinal histological lesions compatible with md, although no macroscopic lesions typical of md were observed in the digestive tract. this reinforces the idea that pi animals can remain asymptomatic in the herds for more than 2 years, perpetuating infection and disease. in bvdv pi cattle, ihc should show strong positive immunolabeling in all or most tissues/organs, since infection in these animals is disseminated/ multisystemic, and the tissues usually contain high viral loads [29] . the strong widespread intra-and extralesional immunolabeling in the lungs, intestines, liver, and kidneys of case 6, along with the viral genome detected in the serum, indicated that this steer was viremic and most likely represented a pi animal.fetal responses to bvdv infection are influenced mainly by gestational age, fetal immune response, and viral biotype and subtype [29, 30] . abortions at 6-8 gestational months identified as cases 2 and 8 in this work were most likely caused by n. caninum given the nature of the fetal lesions, which were typical of this protozoan, and its intralesional detection via ihc in the brain/myocardium as well as by pcr in the brain in both cases. however, coinfections with bvdv-1a (case 2) and bvdv-2b (case 8) were identified by rt-qpcr/ sequencing, indicating a congenital/transplacental circulation and transmission of both viral species/subtypes in these fetuses. because fetuses infected with ncp bvdv strains before the 4th gestational month are generally immunotolerant to fig. 3 renal lesions in a beef steer infected with bvdv-1a (case 5). a a section of kidney shows multifocal cortical renal infarcts. b micrograph of the affected kidney depicting severe arteriolitis with thrombosis (bottom) and extensive coagulative necrosis of the adjacent cortical renal tubules with interstitial hemorrhage (acute infarction), h&e stain the virus and therefore develop persistent infections, the viral load in pi fetal tissues is usually high and detectable by ihc [29] . in contrast, in our fetuses (cases 2, 7, and 8), the virus was undetected by ihc, although it was identified by rt-qpcr, suggesting that the viral load may have been below the ihc detection limit and indirectly suggesting that these fetal infections were transient/acute. the roles of bvdv-1a and bvdv-2b infections as causes of abortions in these cases could not be determined. interestingly, in a study conducted in dairy cattle, bvdv-induced immunosuppression was hypothesized to contribute to the occurrence of abortions due to n. caninum [31] , although more detailed investigations are needed to confirm the possible synergistic association between these agents [32] .fetuses that survive ncp bvdv strain infections before day 90, and more rarely up to day 125 of gestation, invariably develop immunotolerance to the virus and are born pi [33] . immunotolerance is postulated to be mediated by the virus's ability to inhibit type i interferon production in infected fetal cells, allowing the infection to persist [34] . however, depending on the gestational age and viral strain, transplacental infection can also result in embryonic/fetal death (reabsorption, mummification, or abortion), congenital malformations, or birth of clinically healthy calves [30, 35] .bvdv subtyping of the case 2 fetus (outbreak 2) was identified as bvdv-1a, while for the case 7 and 8 fetuses (outbreak 6), subtyping was identified as bvdv-2b. bielefeldt-ohmann et al. [29] reported that both bvdv-2 and bvdv-1b have a similar tissue tropism, although bvdv-2 passes through the placenta more quickly. additionally, antigenic immunolabeling in the fetal tissues was more intense for bvdv-2 than for bvdv-1b [29] . in the 3 fetuses evaluated in our study, bvdv immunolabeling was negative in all analyzed tissues, independent of the infecting viral species/subtype. this finding suggests that the fetuses were not pi, but rather were acutely/transiently infected, which may or may not have contributed to abortion due to n. caninum in cases 2 and 8 as discussed previously. when infection occurs in the last third of gestation, the fetal bovine immune system is sufficiently developed to respond to the virus, being comparable with a transient postnatal infection [35, 36] . serological assays to assess whether these fetuses had developed specific humoral responses to bvdv were not performed in our study. transient/acute bvdv infections are largely subclinical or cause mild clinical signs, although they can induce leukopenia (lymphopenia, monocytopenia) and reduce antibody production and neutrophil release and function, resulting in immunosuppression. such immunosuppression favors secondary bacterial and/or viral infections [13] that can contribute to respiratory, digestive, or septicemic diseases [13, 37] . in the three animals from outbreaks 3 and 4 (cases 3-5), bvdv infection likely contributed to the occurrence of pneumonic histophilosis (case 3), enteric/septicemic salmonellosis (case 4), and septicemia or urinary infection by opportunistic pathogens such as streptococcus sp. and e. coli (case 5). these coinfections were confirmed by isolating the bacterial agents involved in each case, and their pathogenic role was established by evaluating the lesions compatible with those caused by these agents in the respective pathological examinations.acquiring animals without checking their bvdv infection status is an important risk factor for bvdv infection in cattle herds. this is directly related to introducing pi animals that can carry the infection or new viral strains into the herds [38] [39] [40] [41] . in 3 of the outbreaks reported here (outbreaks 3-5), the anamnestic information revealed that cattle from different origins were introduced and mixed into the herds without prior bvdv testing, which possibly contributed to disseminating and spreading infection and disease between farms. detecting and removing infected cattle from the herds is key in controlling bvdv infections.bvdv-2 is generally considered more virulent, being frequently related to disease and death [36, 42] . however, in a study conducted in the usa, both bvdv-1 and bvdv-2 were diagnosed in cattle with clinical respiratory and digestive manifestations, as well as in necropsied cattle [42] , with bvdv-1 being the most common species [42, 43] . bvdv-1a (cases 1, 5, and 6) and bvdv-2b (cases 3 and 4) were identified in heifers/steers in our work, indicating that both species are related to postnatal morbidity and mortality in cattle in uruguay. in other south american countries, clinical disease has been reported for bvdv-1a, bvdv-1b, bvdv-2a, and bvdv-2b in argentina [44] [45] [46] ; bvdv-1b, bvdv-1d, bvdv-1i, and bvdv-2b in brazil [47] [48] [49] [50] ; and bvdv-1a, bvdv-1b, and bvdv-1c in chile and peru [17, 51] . although cattle exposed to bvdv in utero constitute a significant portion of clinical presentations, cases of transient/acute postnatal infection may be significant sources of direct losses [1] . several of the deaths reported in outbreaks 3 and 4 (cases 3-5) were likely due to transient/acute bvdv infections aggravated by secondary bacterial infections. the arteriolitis observed in case 3 is a lesion frequently found in bvdv cases [13] , whereas it is not a typical finding in salmonellosis [52] , the agent with which this calf was coinfected. this case presented typical lesions of both agents, and although salmonella typhimurium can cause disease and death by itself, it also behaves as an opportunistic pathogen, and thus, in this case, the bvdv may have predisposed to clinical salmonellosis. additional evidence of transient/acute infection in these cases included detection of intralesional bvdv antigens by ihc in only some of the calf tissues examined by this technique.the ihc performed in this study used a commercial monoclonal primary antibody against bvdv glycoprotein 55 (envelope glycoprotein e2) made using the bvdv nadl strain. although this antibody binds to and cross-reacts with most bvdv strains, it does not bind to some strains (such as oregon c24v used to produce vaccines in the usa) per the manufacturer and published information [53] . the major glycoprotein e2 is the most variable and immunodominant glycoprotein in bvdv, and as such, some strains may not bind to this antibody [54] . our results indicated that this procedure enabled identifying at least four uruguayan field strains: three bvdv-1a strains from outbreaks 1, 4, and 5, and one bvdv-2b strain from outbreak 3. however, additional crossneutralization studies should be performed to assess whether this antibody cross-reacts with other local field bvdv strains, since reduced reactivity of anti-bvdv antibodies has been identified to cause failed detection of field isolates (particularly bvdv-2a) [55] .in uruguay, a serological study conducted in beef cattle in 2000-2001 indicated that 69% of 6358 animals were seropositive and that 100% of 230 herds had at least one seropositive animal [22] . even with a high viral circulation in the country's cattle population, only 3% of farmers implement preventive vaccinations [22] . more recently, active bvdv infections in cattle in uruguay were explored in a study in which 390 serum samples from 14 herds were analyzed to search for viral antigens by capture elisa and for viral genomes by rt-qpcr. sixteen (4.1%) of these animals were positive by both techniques [18] , suggesting that they were either pi animals and/or acute/transient infections acquired postnatally. interestingly, the mortality rate was 3.5% in the herd with md from outbreak 1 in our study, suggesting, hypothetically, that 3.5% of this herd could have been pi animals, a value close to that found by maya et al. [18] . although the prevalence of pi animals in a herd is generally < 2%, it can be as high as 25-30% in herds where many cows/heifers were exposed to ncp bvdv strains during early pregnancy [13] .the only published study to explore bvdv genetic diversity in uruguay found that the main species/subtype was bvdv-1a [18] . coincidentally, this subtype was found in the md case (outbreak 1) and in outbreaks 2, 4, and 5 described herein, indicating that, besides being frequent, this subtype is associated with disease and death in cattle, which is unprecedented in uruguay in the scientific literature. based on our results, bvdv-2b can also be regarded as a significant cause of disease in uruguay. in addition, this work expands the geographical distribution (south) and the biotype of infected cattle (dairy) in uruguay for bvdv-2b, since this subtype had previously been detected only in beef cattle in the department of rivera, in northern uruguay [18] .vaccines commercially available for bvdv prevention in uruguay are manufactured with inactivated virus and can only provide partial protection, unlike modified-live vaccines used in other regions [56] , including south american countries such as brazil [57] . recent investigations in argentina have led to developing an enhanced bvdv subunit vaccine expressed in a baculovirus, based on a truncated e2 glycoprotein fused to a single-chain antibody that targets antigenpresenting cells [58] . this vaccine's immunogenicity was tested in guinea pigs and cattle, and immunized cattle developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies against bvdv up to 1 year after immunization. based on these results, the vaccine was scaled up and registered and is being commercialized as the first argentinean subunit vaccine for cattle [59] . whether these vaccines protect against uruguayan bvdv strains remains to be addressed.bvdv causes pathology and is associated with diseases and mortality in beef and dairy cattle in uruguay. more extensive and systematic studies are necessary to determine the epidemiology and economic impacts of bvdv for livestock in uruguay as well as the distribution and frequency of the different species/subtypes involved in clinical settings. costbenefit analyses and feasibility studies could help establish preventive and control programs for bvdv at the farm, regional, and national levels.as the outbreaks of covid-19 in worldwide, coronavirus has once again caught the attention of people. canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population, and sometimes causes even fatal cases. here, to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (ccov) strains in china, we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. of the 213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for ccov. co-infection with canine parvovirus (cpv), canine astrovirus (caastv), canine kobuvirus (cakv), torque teno canis virus (ttcav) were ubiquitous existed. mixed infection of different ccov subtypes exists extensively. considering the limited sequences data in recent years, we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype ccov-ii variant and ccov-iia was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating. moreover, we identified strain b906_zj_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain a76, and both of them clustered with ccov-ii variant, which were not well clustered with the known subtypes. recombination analysis of b906_zj_2019 indicated that strain b906_zj_2019 may a recombinant variant between ccov-i and ccov-ii, which is consistent with strain a76. furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current ccov-iia strains circulating in china and the classic ccov-iia strains, in spite of the unknown functions. in a word, we report a useful information as to the etiology and evolution of canine coronavirus in china based on the available sequences, which is urgent for the devise of future effective disease prevention and control strategies.etiology and genetic evolution of canine coronavirus circulating in five provinces of china, during 2018-2019a microarray or a dna chip is a small glass or silica surface bearing dna probes. probes are single stranded reverse transcribed mrnas, each located at a specific spot of the chip for hybridization with its watson-crick complementary sequence in a target to form the double helix [1] . microarrays currently use two forms of probes, namely, oligonucleotide (shortly, oligo) and cdna, and have prevalently been used in the analysis of gene expression levels, which measures the amount of gene expression in a cell by observing the hybridization of mrna to different probes, each targeting a specific gene. with the ability to identify a specific target in a biological sample, microarrays are also well-suited for detecting biological agents for genetic and chronic disease [2, 3, 4, 5] . furthermore, as viral pathogens can be detected at the molecular and genomic level much before the onset of physical symptoms in a patient, the microarray technology can be used for an early detection of patients infected with viral pathogens [6, 7, 8] .the success of microarrays depends on the quality of probes that are tethered on the chip. having an optimized set of probes is beneficial for two reasons. one, the background hybridization is minimized, hence true gene expression levels can be more accurately determined [9] . the other, as the number of oligos needed per gene is minimized, the cost of each microarray is minimized or the number of genes on each chip is increased, yielding oligo fingerprinting a much faster and more cost-efficient technique [9, 10] . short probes consisting of 15-25 nucleotides (nt) are used in genotyping applications [1] . having short optimal probes means a high genotyping accuracy in terms of both sensitivity and specificity [6, 9] and can play a key role in genotyping applications.from the perspective of numerical optimization, genomic data present an unprecedented challenge for supervised learning approaches for a number of reasons. first, genomic data are long sequences over the nucleic acid alphabet σ = {a,c,g,t}. second, for example, the complexity of viral flora, owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes, requires a supervised learning theory to be trained on a large collection of target and non-target samples. that is, a typical training set contains a large number of large-scale samples. third, a supervised learning framework usually requires a systematic pairing or differencing between each target and non-target samples during the course of training a decision rule [10, 11, 12, 13] . adding to these, the nature of data classification is difficult [14] .based on the general framework of logical analysis of data (lad) from [15] , we develop in this paper a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes of length l nt, where l ∈ [6, 10] . to list some advantages of selecting oligo probes by the proposed method, first, the method selects probes via sequential solution of a small number of compact set covering (sc) instances, which offers a great advantage from computational point of view. to be more specific, consider classification of two types of data and suppose that a training set is comprised of m + target and m − non-target sequences. the size of the sc training instances solved by the proposed method is minimum of m + and m − orders of magnitude smaller than optimization learning models used in [10, 11, 12] . second, the method uses the sequence information only and selects probes via optimization based on principles of probability and statistics. that is, the probability of an l−mer (oligo of length l) appearing in a single sequence by chance is (0.25) l , hence the probability of an l−mer appearing in multiple samples of one type but in none or only a few of the sequences of the other type by chance alone is extremely small. third, the proposed method does not rely on any extra tool, such as blastn [16] , a local sequence alignment search tool that is commonly used for probe selection [6, 8, 17] , or the existence of pre-selected representative probes [6] . this makes the method truly stand-alone and free of problems that may possibly be caused by limitations associated with external factors. last, with an array of efficient (meta-)heuristic solution procedures for sc, the proposed method is readily implementable for an efficient selection of oligo probes.as for the organization of this paper, we develop an effective method for selecting short oligo probes in section 2 (for reasons of space, we omit proofs for the mathematical results in this section) and extensively test the proposed probe design method in various in silico genotyping experiments in section 3 with using viral genomic sequences from the los alamos national laboratory and the national center of biotechnology information websites.the task of classifying more than two types of data can be accomplished by sequential classifications of two types of + and − data (see [18, 19, 20] and section 3 below). without loss of generality, therefore, we present the material below in the context of binary classification.the backbone of the proposed procedure is lad. a typical implementation of lad analyzes data on hand via four sequential stages of data binarization, support feature selection, pattern generation and classification rule formation. as a boolean logic-based, lad first converts all non-binary data into equivalent binary observations. a + (−) 'pattern' in lad is defined as a conjunction of one or more binary attributes or their negations that distinguishes one or more + (−) type observations from all − (+) observations. the number of attributes used in a pattern is called the 'degree' of the pattern. as seen from the definition, patterns hold the structural information hidden in data. after patterns are generated, they are aggregated into a partially-defined boolean discriminant function/rule to generalize the discovered knowledge to classify new observations.referring readers to [13, 15, 21] for more background in lad, we design a lad-based method below for efficiently analyzing large-scale genomic data.let there be m + and m − sample observations of type + (target) and − (nontarget), respectively. for a dna sequence is a sequence of nucleic acids a, c, g and t, and the training sequences need to be converted into boolean sequences of 0 and 1 before lad can be applied. toward this end, we first choose an integer value for l, usually l ∈ [6, 10] (see section 3), generate all 4 l possible l−mers over the four nucleic acid letters and then number them consecutively from 1 to 4 l by a mapping scheme. next, each l−mer is selected in turn and every training sample is fingerprinted with the oligo for its presence or absence. that is, with oligo j, we scan each sequence p i , i ∈ s + ∪ s − , from the beginning of the sequence and shifting to the right by a base and stamp p ij = 1, if oligo j is present in sequence i; and 0, otherwise.after this, the oligos that appear in all or none of the training sequences can be deleted from further consideration. we re-number the surviving l−mers consecutively from 1 to n and replace the original training sequences described in the nucleic acid alphabets by their boolean representations. let n = {1, . . . , n}.the data are now described by n attributes a j ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ n . for observation p i , i ∈ s • , • ∈ {+, −}, let p ij denote the binary value the j−th attribute takes in this observation. denote by l j the literal of binary attribute a j . then, l j = a j (l j = a j ) instructs to take (negate) the value of a j in all sequences. a term t is a conjunction of literals. given a term t, let n t ⊆ n denote the index of literals included in the term. then,note here that n t of a • pattern identifies probes that collectively distinguish one or more • sequences from the sequences of the other type.let us introduce n additional features a n+j , j ∈ n , and use a n+j to negate a j . let n = {1, . . . , 2n} and let us introduce a binary decision variable x j for a j , j ∈ n , to determine whether to include l j in a pattern. [15] formulated a compact mixed integer and linear programming (milp) model below with respect to a reference sampleconsider the following.we note here that genomic data are large-scale in nature. furthermore, owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes, the complexity of viral flora is high, and this requires large numbers of target and non-target viral samples to be used for selecting optimal genotyping probes. adding to these the difficulties associated with numerical solution of milp, we see that (milp-2.i • ) above presents no practical way of selecting genotyping probes.with the need to develop a more efficient pattern generation scheme, we select a reference sequencefor k ∈ s• and j ∈ n. next, we setfor l ∈ s • and j ∈ n. now, consider the set covering modelwhere c j (j ∈ n ) are positive real numbers.let (x, y) denote a feasible solution of (sc • i ). then,forms a • lad pattern.although smaller than the milp counterpart by only one constraint and one integer variable, (sc • i ) has a much simpler structure and is defined only in terms of 0-1 variables. in addition, it can exploit any of sc heuristic procedures developed so far (see, for example, [22] and references therein) for its efficient solution, hence is much preferred.note that (sc • i ) is defined by m + + m − − 1 cover inequalities and n + m • − 1 binary variables. also, recall that n is large for genomic sequences and the analysis of viral sequences requires large numbers of target and non-target sequences, that is, m + and m − are also large numbers. to develop a more compact sc-based probe selection model, we select a reference sequence p i , i ∈ s • , • ∈ {+, −}, and set the values of a (i,k) j for k ∈ s• and j ∈ n via (1). consider the following sc model:where c j 's are positive reals.theorem 2. let x denote a feasible solution of (sc-pg • i ). then, p generated on x via (2) forms a • lad pattern.below, we use (sc-pg • i ) to design one simple oligo probe selection procedure. let p • denote the set of • patterns generated so far. in this section, we extensively test the proposed probe design for the classification of viral disease-agents in in silico setting with using genomic sequences obtained from the los alamos national laboratory (lanl) and the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). table 1 summarizes the number and the length (the minimum, average±1 standard deviation and maximum lengths) of each type of the genomic data that were used in our experiments.in analyzing data in an experiment, we first decided on a length of oligos to use by calculating the smallest integer value l such that 4 l became larger than or equal to the average of the lengths of target and non-target sequences of the experiment. then, 4 l candidate oligos were generated to fingerprint and binarize the data. note here that if a constraint in (sc-pg • i ) has all zero coefficients, then the sc instance has no feasible solution, and this case arises when the reference sequence p i , i ∈ s • , and the sequence p j , j ∈ s• have identical 0-1 fingerprints, which is a contradiction. supervised learning methodologies, including lad, presume for the existence of a classification function that each unique sequence in the training set belongs to exactly one of the two classes. when data under analysis are indeed contradiction-free, then contradiction-free 0-1 clones of the data can always be obtained by using oligos of longer length for data fingerprinting and binarization. therefore, when we generated the identical fingerprint for data of different types, we incremented the value of l by 1 and repeated the data binarization stage until the binary representations of the data became contradiction free. next, procedure sc-pg was applied to generate patterns, hence probes. in applying procedure sc-pg in these in silico experiments, we selected a minimal set of oligo probes by setting c j = 1 for all j ∈ n . for solving the unicost (sc-pg • i )'s generated, we used the textbook greedy heuristic [23] for ease of implementation.denote by p + 1 , . . . , p + n+ and p − 1 , . . . , p − n− the positive and negative patterns, respectively, generated via procedure sc-pg. in classifying unseen + (target) and − (non-target) sequences, we use three decision rules. specifically, for the polyspecific genotyping experiments (in section 3.1 and experiments 2 and 3 in section 3.2), we form the standard lad classification rule [13] δ :=where ω • i denotes the number of • training sequences covered by p • i . we assign class + (−) to new sequence p if δ(p) > 0 (δ(p) < 0). we fail to classify sequence p if δ(p) = 0.for monospecific genotyping in experiment 1 in section 3.2, we form a decision rule by where p k 1 , . . . , p k n k are the probe(s) selected to for virus (sub-)type k, and assign p to class k if δ k (p) > 0 while δ i (p) = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , m, i = k. when δ(p) > 0 for more than two virus types or δ k (p) = 0 for all k, then we fail to assign a class to sequence p.in each of the experiments in this section, we tested the proposed oligo probe selection method in 20 independent hold-out experiments, each with randomly selected 90% of the target and of the non-target data forming a training set of sequences and the remaining 10 % of the target and of the non-target sequences forming the testing data. more specifically, after a training set of data was formed, we binarized the training data and selected optimal oligo probes on them via procedure sc-pg. next, a classification rule was formed by one of (3), (4) and (5) above and then used for classifying the corresponding testing sequences. these steps were repeated 20 times to obtain the average testing performance and other relevant information of the experiment.the computational platform used for these experiments was an intel 2.66ghz pentium linux pc with 512mb of memory. (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 64 1341 1434±25 1467the infection with hpv is the main cause of cervical cancer, the second most common cancer in women worldwide [24, 25] . there are more than 80 identified types of hpv and the genital hpv types are subdivided into high and low risk types: low risk hpv types are responsible for most common sexually transmitted viral infections while high risk hpv types are a crucial etiological factor for the development of cervical cancer [26] . we applied the proposed probed design method on the 72 hpv sequences downloaded from lanl with their classification found in table 3 of [27] . the selected probes were used to form a decision rule by (3) and tested for their classification capability.results from this polyspecific probe selection experiment are provided in table 2 . in this table and also in the table found in the following subsection, the target (+) and the non-target (−) virus types of the experiments are first specified. then, the tables provide two bits of information on the candidate oligos, namely, the length l and the average and the standard deviation of the number of features generated and used in the 20 runs of each experiment for data binarization and for pattern generation. provided next in the tables is the information on the number of probes selected in the format 'the average ± 1 standard deviation' and information on the lad patterns generated. finally, the testing performance of the probes selected is provided in the last column of the tables, summarized in format 'the average ± 1 standard deviation' of the percentage of the correct classifications of the unseen sequences. briefly summarizing, the proposed probe design method selected probes on the hpv data in a few cpu seconds that tested 90.6% accurate in classifying the unseen hpv samples. for comparison, the same hpv dataset was used in [2] and [27] for the classification of hpv by high and low risk types. in brief, the probe design methods of [2] and [27] required several cpu hours of computation and selected probes that obtained 85.6% and 81.1% correct classification rates, respectively.before moving on, we note that the sequences belonging to the target and the non-target groups in this experiment all have different hpv subtypes (see table 3 in [27] ). the combination of all target and non-target sequences being different from one another and the presence of noise in the data (the classification errors) gave rise to selecting a relatively large number of polyspecific probes in this experiment.the proposed probe design method was tested on genomic viral sequences from ncbi for selecting monospecific and polyspecific probes for screening for sars and ai in a number of different binary and multicategory experimental setting and performed superbly on all counts. we describe individual experiments below and summarize results from these experiments in table 3 . 1±0 d e g r e e1 * : in format average ± standard deviation † : percentage of correct classifications of testing/unseen data experiment 1. sars virus vs. coronavirus sars virus is phylogenetically most closely related to group 2 coronavirus [28] . 105 sars sequences and 39 coronavirus samples were used to select 1 monospecific probe for screening for sars. used in a classification rule (4), the sars probe and one probe selected for coronavirus together perfectly classified all testing sequences.this experiment simulates a sars pandemic where suspected patients with sars-like symptoms are screened for the disease. we used the 105 sars virus sequences and 108 samples of other influenza virus types (the 'other virus' in table 1 ) in this experiment and selected polyspecific probes. used in a classification rule (3), these probes collectively gave the perfect classification of all testing sequences. experiment 3. classification of lethal ai virus h5 & h9 and other influenza virus h subtypes ai virus h5 and h9 subtypes cause a most fatal form of the disease [29] , and they were separated from the other h subtypes of influenza virus in this experiment. 241 h5 and h9 target sequences and 1010 other h subtype sequences were used to select polyspecific probes for detecting ai virus h5 and h9 subtypes from the rest. in a classification rule (3), the selected probes collectively classified all testing sequences correctly.the statement "monospecific neuraminidase (na) subtype probes were insufficiently divers to allow confident na subtype assignment" from [6] motivated us to design this experiment on multicategory and monospecific classification of influenza virus by n subtypes. we used the three influenza virus n subtypes with 30 or more samples in table 1 and selected monospecific probes for their classification. tested in a classification rule (5), the selected probes performed perfectly in classifying all testing sequences. note that only a small number of monospecific probes were selected and proved 'needed' in this experiment.coronaviruses (order nidovirales, family coronaviridae) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense rna viruses with a large genome of 27-31 kb. canine coronavirus (ccov) belongs to the genus alphacoronavirus and species alphacoronavirus-1 along with feline coronavirus (fcov) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (tgev); these viruses display greater than 96% sequence identity within the replicase polyprotein (pp1ab) gene (adams and carstens, 2012; carstens, 2010; pratelli, 2011) .to date, ccovs can be classified into two genotypes, ccov-i and ccov-ii, according to the genetic identity between these viruses and fcov types i and ii, respectively (pratelli et al., 2003a) . however, a putative recombination between ccov-ii and tgev at the 5 0 end of the s protein gene gave rise to a new subtype. as a result, the ccov-ii genotype was divided into two subtypes, ccov-iia (classical strains) and iib (tgev-like strains) (decaro et al., 2009 (decaro et al., , 2010 . infection may occur with a single strain, but the two ccov genotypes are commonly detected simultaneously in the same dog (decaro et al., 2005 (decaro et al., , 2009 erles and brownlie, 2009; ntafis et al., 2013; pratelli et al., 2004a; pratelli, 2011) since the first reports in 1971 (binn et al., 1974) , ccov infection has been associated with mild cases of diarrhea. clinical signs can range from moderate to severe, depending on whether the infection occurs in combination with other pathogens such as canine parvovirus (cpv), canine distemper virus or canine adenovirus type i (decaro et al., 2004 (decaro et al., , 2007a pratelli et al., 1999a pratelli et al., , 2001 . in contrast, veterinary microbiology 168 (2014) 8-15 to characterize canine coronavirus (ccov) circulating in diarrheic puppies in brazil, 250 fecal samples collected between 2006 and 2012 were tested. by using rt-pcr to partially amplify the m gene, ccov rna was detected in 30 samples. sequence analysis of the m protein grouped eight strains with ccov-i and another 19 with ccov-ii prototypes. to genotype/subtype the ccov strains and assess the occurrence of single or multiple ccov infections, rt-pcr of the s gene was performed, and 25/30 ccov-positive strains amplified with one or two primer pairs. for 17/25 samples, single infections were detected as follows: six ccov-i, nine ccov-iia and two ccov-iib. eight samples were positive for more than one genotype/subtype as follows: seven ccov-i/iia and one ccov-i/iib. sequence analysis revealed that the ccov-i and iia strains shared high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototypes. the brazilian strains of ccov-iib displayed an aminoacid insertion that was also described in ccov-iib-ucd-1 and tgev strains. among the 25 ccov-positive puppies, five had a fatal outcome, all but one of which were cases of mixed infection. the current study is the first reported molecular characterization of ccov-i, iia and iib strains in brazil.ß 2013 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.highly virulent ccov-ii strains (pantropic variants) that were detected in europe (decaro et al., 2007b ntafis et al., 2012; zicola et al., 2012) caused fatal disease in puppies.epidemiological investigations have revealed that ccovs have spread worldwide (decaro et al., 2009 erles & brownlie, 2009; mcelligott et al., 2011; naylor et al., 2001; ntafis et al., 2013; stavisky et al., 2012) . serological studies conducted in southern brazil revealed the presence of antibodies to this virus in 45-50% of dogs, indicating that ccovs are already widespread in the canine population (castro et al., 2010a; dezengrini et al., 2007) . nevertheless, no molecular characterization of ccov strains has been reported to date. this study was conducted to characterize, for the first time, the ccov genotypes detected in fecal samples from diarrheic puppies in brazil.fecal samples were collected from a total of 250 privately owned (not kenneled) dogs with diarrhea and examined at veterinary clinics in rio de janeiro from 2006 to 2012. dogs were included in the study if the owner reported an increase in the frequency, fluidity or volume of feces (battersby and harvey, 2006) . information regarding age, breed, vaccination status and clinical findings was obtained from the veterinary records. this trial was licensed by the ethics committee of animal use -ceua-proppi/uff no. 81/09 and 223/12.genomic rna was extracted from 10% fecal suspensions in tris-ca 2+ (0.01 m, ph 7.2) using the purelink tm spin column-based kit (invitrogen 1 ). the reverse transcription was performed with random primers (invitrogen 1 ) and the superscript iii enzyme (invitrogen 1 ) by following the manufacturer's instructions.for ccov screening, pcr was performed with the ccov1-ccov-2 (6729-7138) primer pair, which amplifies a 409-bp fragment of the gene encoding transmembrane protein m, as previously described (pratelli et al., 1999b) . primer positions refer to the sequence of the ccov-iia insavc strain (d13096).differential primers directed to the spike (s) gene were used for ccov genotyping/subtyping as follows: el1f/ el1r, s5f/s6r and cepol-1/tgsp-2 (erles and brownlie, 2009; pratelli et al., 2004a) . primers el1f/el1r (2611-2956) were used to amplify a 346-bp fragment corresponding to the spike gene of the ccov-i elmo/02 strain (ay170345) (pratelli et al., 2004a) . primer pair s5f/s6r (3991-4684) amplified a 694-bp product corresponding to the spike gene of the ccov-iia insavc strain (d13096), whereas primers cepol-1 and tgsp-2 amplified a 370-bp product corresponding to nucleotides (nt) 20168-20537 of the tgev purdue genome (aj271965.1) (erles and brownlie, 2009 ). the pcr assays were performed according to the protocols described by pratelli et al. (2004a) and erles and brownlie (2009) .the amplicons obtained after partial amplification of the m and s genes were purified using the gfx tm pcr dna and gel band purification kit (ge healthcare 1 ) and subjected to direct sequencing with the big dye terminator 1 kit and an abi prism 1 3730 dna analyzer (applied biosystems, ca). both strands of each amplicon were sequenced at least twice. sequence editing and multiple alignments were performed with bioedit sequence editor 7.0 software. nucleotide similarity with sequences deposited in the genbank database was assessed using the blast tool (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi). sequence analyses were performed with the mega 5.1 software program (tamura et al., 2007) . for the construction of phylogenetic trees, deduced amino-acid sequences were used. bootstrap analysis of 2000 replicates was conducted to determine the significance of branching in the constructed tree.the nucleotide sequences generated in this study were deposited in the genbank with the following accession numbers: kf308994-kf309020 for the m gene, kf312718-kf312728 for the s gene from ccov-i, kf312729-kf312736 for the s gene from ccov-iia and kf321783-kf321785 for the s gene from ccov-iib.fecal samples that tested positive for ccov were also screened for cpv, canine calicivirus (cacv), canine astrovirus (caastv) and group a-rotavirus (rv-a) by either pcr or rt-pcr and sequencing according to the protocols previously described castro et al., 2011; farkas et al., 2004; gó mez et al., 2011; grellet et al., 2012) .by using pcr to amplify the m gene, ccov rna was detected in 30 out of 250 sampled dogs. the majority of the positive samples (21/30) were from puppies under two months of age.for 27/30 strains, the sequences were of sufficient quality for analysis. based on the aa changes found in residues 127, 173, 193, 200 and 201 of the m protein, eight strains were characterized as ccov-i while another 19 as ccov-ii (table 1) .alignment of the deduced amino acid (aa) sequences to the sequence of strain insavc (d13096) revealed 10 nonsynonymous substitutions. among the 10 aa changes, five were found in all ccov-i strains: 127 (ile/val ! ala), 173 (val ! thr), 193 (ile ! met), 200 (asp ! glu) and 201 (asn ! his). as shown in table 1 , these aa changes were present in the strains from this study and in the reference strains.moreover, six of the brazilian strains analyzed contained non-synonymous substitutions not previously described. aa changes at residues 119 (ile ! thr) and 121 (gly!cys) were found in strain rj1133/12. another two strains (rj915/08 and rj916/08) contained a nonsynonymous substitution at residue 120 (ala ! thr), while rj999/10 was substituted at residue 144 (lys ! arg). an aa change at residue 137 (ile ! phe) was found in two ccov-ii strains from 2011 (rj1084/11 and rj1091/11) (table 1) .a rt-pcr typing approach for the s gene was utilized and 25/30 ccov-positive strains showed amplification with one or two primer pairs (table 2 ). in 17/25 samples, a single infection was detected: six samples with ccov-i, nine with ccov-iia and two with ccov-iib. eight samples were positive for more than one genotype/subtype: seven samples with ccov-i/iia and one with ccov-i/iib (table 2) . among five samples giving negative results for the s gene, two (rj917/08 and 925/08) were pcr-positive for the m gene but could not be analyzed after sequencing. another three samples (rj900/08, rj1084/11 and rj1140/12) were characterized as ccov-ii.the results of ccov typing (i and ii) by m and s genes were concordant for 16/17 samples from puppies with single infections. characterization of one sample (rj1094/11) was not possible, as its s gene was amplified by rt-pcr with the ccov-i-specific primers el1f/el1r, while it was typed as ccov-ii by sequence analysis of its m region. among seven samples that were positive for more than one ccov genotype/subtype by s gene, sequence analysis of the m gene allowed the characterization of only one genotype (table 2) .sequence analysis of the 11 brazilian ccov-i strains revealed that they shared 96.2-100% nt and 98.2-100% aa identity. these strains also shared 94.2-97.1% nt and 98.2-100% aa identity with either elmo/02 (ay307020.1) or 23/ 03 (ay307021.1) prototypes. amino acid changes were found at residue 1207 (lys ! arg) in one sample (891/08) and at 1264 (thr ! met) in another six samples (rj861/07, rj982/09, rj999/10, rj1006/10, rj1007/10 and rj1094/10). at the phylogenetic level, the sequenced strains were grouped in the same cluster with either elmo/02 or 23/03 prototypes (fig. 1a) . bold indicates amino acid changes of brazilian strains.sequence analysis of the eight brazilian ccov-iia strains showed that they shared 90.0-99.7% nt and 93.0-100% aa identity. these strains also shared 88.4-96.1% nt and 94.3-99.1% aa identity with the ccov-iia reference strains insavc (d13096), bgf-10 (ay342160.1) and cb/05 (dq112226.1). among the aa changes identified, six were found only in samples from this study (rj905/08, rj1042/11, rj1093/11 and rj1137/12). the sequence of the rj1086/11 strain revealed eight aa changes encoded on the 694-bp fragment that have not been described for other ccov-iia strains (table 3) . upon phlylogenetic analysis this strain formed a cluster distinct from the other ccov-iia sequences (fig. 1b) .sequence analysis of the three brazilian ccov-iib strains showed that they shared 95.3-98.2% nt and - iib  3  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  13  14  15  18  24  25  32  38  45

shared 79.1-84.3% nt and 84.2-91.2% aa identity with the ccov-iib reference strains ucd-1 (af116248.1) and 430/07 (eu924790.1). the ccov-iib strains from this study exhibited an insertion of three nucleotides at the 5 0 end of the spike gene, resulting in the addition of an aa at residue five as in the ucd-1 strain. these samples also showed three non-synonymous substitutions when compared to other ccov-iib strains (table 3) . according to the phylogenetic analysis result, the brazilian ccov-iib strains formed a unique clade (fig. 1c) . mixed infections were detected in 14/25 (56%) puppies: 10 cases of ccov/cpv, one of ccov/rv-a, one of ccov/cpv/ rv-a and two of ccov/cpv/caastv. as characterization of the ccov genotype/subtype by s gene rt-pcr was not possible for 5/30 samples, they were not included in this analysis (table 2) .based on clinical reports, three ccov-i-positive puppies presented mild enteric signs (soft diarrhea), while four ccov-iia-positive puppies showed more severe clinical signs (vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea); one died during the hospitalization period. a partial sequence analysis of the s gene showed aa identities of 98.7% to the pantropic strains described in the literature (cb/05 and 450/07). in puppies with dual ccov or mixed infections, the clinical signs varied from mild to fatally severe, as shown in table 2 .among 30 ccov-positive puppies, 11 received either one (10 puppies) or three doses (1 puppy) of inactivated ccov vaccine. another 12 had not been vaccinated, and for the remaining seven, the vaccination data were not available.in the past decade, several researchers have studied the importance of ccov as an agent of diarrhea in puppies le poder, 2011; ntafis et al., 2013; pratelli, 2011; stavisky et al., 2012) . in brazil, despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines, cpv is considered the most common viral agent associated with enteritis in puppies (castro et al., 2010b (castro et al., , 2011 . however, data regarding ccov infections in puppies have been restricted to serological surveys. the main objective of this study was to conduct a molecular characterization of the ccov strains that circulate in brazil by partially amplifying the m and s genes.the ccov genotypes may be distinguishable using molecular assays that are able to selectively amplify fragments of orf 5 (m gene) and orf 2 (s gene). in this study, the aa changes found in residues 127, 173, 193, 200 and 201 of the m protein could distinguish between ccov-i and ccov-ii strains. these non-synonymous substitutions had already been described in european samples, but the exact consequence of these mutations is not yet clear (erles and brownlie, 2009; ntafis et al., 2013; pratelli et al., 2003a) .ccov infection in dogs can occur with a single ccov strain, or two strains may be present simultaneously (decaro et al., 2009; ntafis et al., 2013; pratelli et al., 2004a; soma et al., 2011) . in addition, the ccov-ii genotype has been further divided into two subtypes, including the classical (iia) and the tgev-like (iib) ccovs (decaro et al., 2009) . although partial amplification of the m gene has been successfully used to detect ccov-i and ii, this approach does not distinguish between single or multiple ccovs in a dog or discriminate between iia and iib strains.to genotype/subtype the ccov strains and to assess the occurrence of single or multiple ccov infections, three different regions of the s gene were amplified. it was shown that the classical ccov-iia was the most predominant type in single and double infections. both ccov genotypes (i and ii) have been reported to be circulating in europe, china and japan, and ccov infections are frequently characterized by the simultaneous presence of both types ntafis et al., 2013; soma et al., 2011) .preliminary studies have indicated that multiple ccov or mixed infections may be related to more severe symptoms (decaro et al., 2006; pratelli et al., 1999a) . in this study, among the 25 ccov-positive puppies, five had a fatal outcome, all but one of which were cases of mixed infection. it was shown that this one puppy was infected only with a ccov-iia strain that displayed the highest similarity to pantropic strains. as extra-intestinal tissues of this puppy were not available for analysis, it was not possible to confirm infection with a pantropic ccov.in accord with other studies (ntafis et al., 2013; soma et al., 2011) , most of the ccov-positive puppies in this study were less than three months of age. although ccov was detected in vaccinated puppies, it should be emphasized that at this age, the vaccination schedule has not been completed. moreover, the value of ccov vaccines in providing adequate immunity is controversial (pratelli et al., 2003b (pratelli et al., , 2004b .in the present study, the ccov-i and iia strains showed high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototypes. further studies are necessary to clarify the importance of the non-synonymous substitutions found only in the brazilian strains.it was shown that the brazilian ccov-iib strains display an aa insertion that has also been described in ccov-iib-ucd-1 and tgev strains (wesley, 1999) . this aa insertion has not been found in ccov-iib strains circulating in europe (erles and brownlie, 2009; ntafis et al., 2013) , most likely reflecting their geographic origin.in summary, the current study is the first report of a molecular characterization of the ccov-i, iia and iib strains in brazil. the results showed that all three types of ccov circulate among young puppies presenting mild or severe clinical signs of enteritis. the brazilian strains displayed previously undescribed non-synonymous substitutions, but further studies are necessary to clarify the exact consequence of these changes for ccov evolution. the continuous monitoring of ccov will help to elucidate the genetic diversity of these viruses in the brazilian canine population.influenza virus is a rna virus from the orthomyxoviridae family. annually, influenza viruses may develop symptomatic influenza in 20% of children and 5% of adults worldwide (turner et al., 2003) . from the three types a-c only a and b cause widespread outbreaks. further subtyping of influenza a virus is based on the antigenic differences between two surface glycoproteins: haemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na). nowadays, 16 ha (h1-h16) and 9 na (n1-n9) subtypes have been described (fouchier et al., 2005; nicholson et al., 2003) . since 2004, the influenza a virus subtype h5n1 has been the cause of severe disease in various poultry and mammals. the clinical spectrum of avian influenza (h5n1) in humans comprises initial symptoms of high fever (exceeding 38 • c), lower respiratory tract symptoms, clinically significant lymphopenia, abnormalities on chest radiography, and in some cases diarrhea, vomiting (tran et al., 2004) and encephalitis. the overall fatality rate among hospitalized patients with avian influenza a (h5n1) infection has amounted to 57% (who, 2006) . two groups of antiviral agents are currently available for the treatment of influenza infection. the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) block the function of the m2 protein; however, drug resistance in patients has increased to 30% (hayden and hay, 1992) . the more recently developed class of viral neuraminidase inhibitors includes zanamivir (relenza) and oseltamivir (tamiflu) . an important antiviral medication used against all strains of influenza a virus is oseltamivir, which is the first orally active neuraminidase inhibitor in the form of a capsule or powder for liquid suspension (kim et al., 1997) . the neuraminidase inhibitor (nai) oseltamivir imitates natural neuraminidase substrate molecules and binds to the active site of the enzyme in addition to interfering with the release of progeny influenza virus from infected host cells (moscona, 2005a) . therefore, neuraminidase (na) cannot cleave a terminal n-acetylneuraminic acid residue from an oligosaccharide chain and thus, the virions self-aggregate and bind to the surface of infected cells.oseltamivir resistance due to neuraminidase mutations have arisen both in challenge studies and in patients with naturally acquired infections. rates of resistance are estimated at around 1% in the adult population and 5% in pediatric patients (jackson et al., 2000; whitley et al., 2001) . in 2004, kiso et al. (2004) analyzed influenza a viruses (h3n2) collected from 50 children before and during treatment with oseltamivir. eighteen percent of the children (n = 9/50) had neuraminidase mutations at arg292lys (n = 6/9) or glu119val (n = 2/9) or asn294ser (n = 1/9). volunteers experimentally infected with influenza a/texas/36/91 (h1n1) virus and treated with oseltamivir have shown an h274y substitution at the neuraminidase active site (gubareva et al., 2001) . this mutation in response to oseltamivir phosphate treatment leaves the virus severely compromised both in vitro and in vivo (ives et al., 2002) and confers about 400-600fold resistance (wetherall et al., 2003) . the mutation at position 274 can influence the sensitivity of influenza n1 na yet not of n2 na to oseltamivir carboxylate by rearranging the shape of the active site to create a pocket for oseltamivir (gubareva, 2004; moscona, 2005b; wang et al., 2002) .safeguarding against a potential influenza a virus subtype h5n1 epidemic, many countries now stockpile oseltamivir. it has recently been reported that oseltamivir-resistant influenza a (h5n1) viruses with the h274y mutation have been isolated from three patients. h5n1 viruses with pronounced oseltamivir resistance were isolated from two of eight vietnamese patients during oseltamivir treatment. both patients died in january 2005 and another resistant case died in february 2005 (beigel et al., 2005; de jong et al., 2005; le et al., 2005) .as an increase in oseltamivir-resistant viruses seems likely, a method aimed at rapidly identifying resistant h5n1 strains applying real-time pcr using taqman probes was designed. the assay enables to identify the h274y mutation from samples originated directly from infected tissue and plasma.oseltamivir-treated and non-treated specimens of several species infected with avian influenza a subtype h5n1, previously detected using the method described by payungporn et al. (2005) , were used. the oseltamivir-treated specimens were: h5n1 oseltamivir-resistant strain in a vietnamese patient (n = 1), oseltamivir-treated tiger cu-t7; panthera tigris tigris (n = 1), white tiger ku-11; p. tigris tigris (n = 1). the oseltamivir untreated specimens were: plasma of h5n1 infected human (n = 1) (chutinimitkul et al., 2006) , several tissues from different organs of tiger, lung (n = 1), spleen (n = 1), kidney (n = 1), liver (n = 1), brain of leopard (panthera pardus) (n = 1), allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs inoculated with the virus according to the method described by the office international des epizooties (oie) originating from a cat; felis catus (n = 1), a dog; canis familiaris (n = 1), a quail (n = 1), an ostrich (n = 1) and chicken (n = 6). these specimens were isolated and provided by: (1) the faculty of veterinary science, chulalongkorn university, bangkok, thailand; (2) the department of livestock development, bangkok, thailand; (3) faculty of veterinary science, kasetsart university, kampaengsaen campus, nakorn pathom, thailand; (4) department of pediatrics, faculty of medicine, srinakharinwirot university, nakhon nayok, thailand; (5) national institute of hygiene and epidemiology, hanoi, vietnam.the nucleotide sequences (n = 246) of the neuraminidase gene of influenza a virus (h5n1) were taken from the genbank database going back as far as 2003-2006 and hence, comprising entries isolated from various species, such as avian, cats, dog, tigers, swine and humans, including dq250165, the sequence of one vietnamese oseltamivir-resistant patient (a/vietnam/cl2009/2005(h5n1)). the alignments were performed using clustal x (version 1.81 from ftp://ftpigbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/clustalx) and bioedit sequence alignment software version 5.0.9 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/ bioedit/bioedit.html).assay target regions were first identified by visual inspection of the sequence alignment. primers were chosen from constant regions of all sequences specific for the neuraminidase gene n1 of influenza a virus most closely related to the probes. mgb taqman probes were chosen from the region covering the drug resistant area (h274y) and designed to be specific for both wild type and mutant. both primers and probes were analyzed using the primer design software (oligos version 9.1 by ruslan kalendar, institute of biotechnology, university of helsinki, finland) and primer express software version 2.0 (applied biosystems, ca). the wild type (h) and mutant (y) mgb taq-man probes were labeled with fam and vic with emission wavelengths at 530 and 560 nm, respectively. the primers and probes used in this study are shown in table 1 .an rna sample extracted from embryonated chicken eggs and previously identified as influenza a virus subtype h5n1 (a/chicken/nakorn-patom/thailand/cu-k2/2004(h5n1)) was applied to design a series of mutagenesis. the oligonucleotides depicted in table 1 were used to generate the series of mutagenesis at amino acid position 274 of the neuraminidase n1 gene which served as a control for all possible patterns of nucleotide change in the area of probe binding. the primers n1muf and n1mur served as the outer primers of each mutagenesis group, which paired with the mutagenesis primers. mutagenesis primer group 1 for h274 is n1mu1f and n1mu1r. mutagenesis primer group 2 for 274y is n1mu2f and n1mu2r. mutagenesis primer groups 3 and 4 were designed for possible varied strains occasionally found. the mutagenesis products of groups 1 and 2 were used to construct mutagenesis groups 3 and 4. mutagenesis group 3 for h274 is n1mu3f and n1mu3r. mutagenesis group 4 for 274y is n1mu4f and n1mu4r. the primary mutagenesis pcr reaction mixture comprised 0.5 l of cdna cu-k2, 0.5 m forward primer (outer or mutagenesis primer), 0.5 m reverse primer (outer or mutagenesis primer), 10 l of 2.5× mastermix (eppendorf, hamburg, germany) and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25 l. the secondary mutagenesis pcr reaction mixture comprised 0.5 l pcr product representative for each mutagenesis group, 0.5 m n1muf, 0.5 m n1mur, 10 l 2.5× mastermix (eppendorf) and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25 l. both amplification reactions were performed in a mastercycler personal (eppendorf) under the following conditions: predenaturation at 94 • c for 2 min followed by 40 amplification cycles consisting of 30 s denaturation at 94 • c, 30 s annealing at 52 • c and 1 min extension at 72 • c and concluded by a final 7 min extension at 72 • c. four groups of mutagenesis pcr products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the gel extraction kit (perfectprep gel cleanup, eppendorf, hamburg, germany). these purified products were inserted into the pgem-t easy vector system (promega, madison, wi) and plasmids were purified by using the high pure plasmid isolation kit (roche, gmbh, germany) according to the manufacturer's specifications. the series of h274y mutations were sequenced and used as controls.viral rna was extracted from 140 l samples of the allantoic fluid of inoculated embryonated eggs, plasma and the supernatant resulting from tissue extraction using the qiamp viral rna mini kit (qiagen, gmbh, germany) according to the man-ufacturer's specifications. reverse transcription was performed on 12 l of each rna sample at 37 • c for 1 h using 200 units of m-mlv reverse-trancriptase (promega), 5 l of 5× m-mlv reaction buffer (promega), 5 l of 10 mm dntp (promega), 25 units of rrnasin ® ribonuclease inhibitor (promega), 1 m universal primer as described by hoffmann et al. (2001) . twelve microliters of rna from the rna extraction kit were heated to 70 • c for 5 min and cooled on ice before adding nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25 l.real-time pcr was performed using the biotools quantimix easy probes kit (biotools, madrid, spain). both probes and primer pairs depicted in table 1 were used in multiple formats, each primer and probe at a final concentration of 0.5 m and 0.20 m, respectively. a combination of 0.5 l cdna from embryonated eggs or 2 l cdna from tissue, serum or plasma with a reaction mixture containing 10 l of quantiprobes, 4.0 mm mgcl 2 and nuclease-free water was adjusted to a final volume of 20 l. real-time pcr amplification was carried out in a rotor-gene 3000 instrument (corbett research, sydney, australia). the amplification reaction consisted of a preincubation step at 95 • c for 10 min to activate the hotstartaq dna polymerase. this was followed by 40 cycles of amplification including denaturation at 95 • c for 10 s, annealing at 55 • c for 15 s and extension at 72 • c for 20 s. two fluorescent signals were obtained once per cycle at the end of the extension step with detectors corresponding to the fam (530 nm) and vic (560 nm) channels, respectively. data acquisition and analysis of the real-time pcr assay were performed using the rotor-gene data analysis software, version 6.0 (corbett research supporting program).cdnas were amplified by pcr in a reaction mixture containing 10 l of 2.5× mastermix (eppendorf) 0.5 m primer f: 5 -atactgagaactcaagagtc-3 , 0.5 m primer r: 5 -ttatccctgcacacacatg-3 and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 25 l. the amplification reaction was performed in a mastercycler personal (eppendorf) under the following conditions: predenaturation at 94 • c for 2 min followed by 40 amplification cycles comprising denaturation at 94 • c for 30 s, annealing at 55 • c for 30 s and extension at 72 • c for 30 s and concluded by a final extension at 72 • c for 7 min. the pcr products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using the gel extraction kit (perfectprep gel cleanup, eppendorf, hamburg). the purified products were inserted into pgem-t easy vector system (promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. ten clones were randomly selected from the resultant white colonies and plasmids were purified using the high pure plasmid isolation kit (roche, gmbh) according to the manufacturer's specifications. for automated dna sequencing, all plasmids were amplified using the gene amp pcr system 9600 (perkin-elmer, ma). the sequenced products were subjected to a perkin-elmer 310 sequence analyzer (perkin-elmer).the specificity of the dual probe real-time pcr was evaluated by cross-reaction tests carried out between rna extracts from isolates or clinical specimens expressing the entire spectrum of na subtypes (n2-n9) of who reference strain influenza and other viral pathogens, such as newcastle disease virus (ndv), respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) subgroups a and b, human metapneumovirus (hmpv), coronavirus oc43, coronavirus 229e, infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv) and infectious bronchitis virus (ibv). the sensitivity was established with plasmids containing a copy of the wild type h274 and mutant 274y serving as reference. the wild type h274 and mutant 274y plasmids were used to determine the capacity of the real-time pcr assay to detect wild type and oseltamivir-resistant codon 274 mutants in a single sample. dna concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. the two control plasmids were diluted to 10 4 , 10 3 , 10 2 and 10 copies/l and each resulting concentration was mixed at 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100 wild type-to-variant ratios. real-time pcr analysis of potential codon 274 variants was performed on each ratio at each concentration under the conditions described above.the result was obtained by using two taqman probes labeled with the fam and vic fluorescent signal for wild type and mutant detection, respectively. the fluorescent signal resulting from real-time pcr can be interpreted as shown in fig. 1 . a sample containing only the wild type strain will emit the fluorescent signal exclusively via the fam channel (530 nm) whereas a sample containing the oseltamivir-resistant variant with a nucleotide alteration at position 274 of the neuraminidase gene will emit oseltamivir-treated vietnamese patient (le et al., 2005) showing both fluorescence signals indicative of a combination between wild type and resistant strain, ku-11: oseltamivir-treated white tiger, cu-t7: oseltamivir-treated tiger showing only the wild type signal. the fluorescent signal via the vic channel (560 nm). in order to develop and optimize the assay these probes were tested on four sets of mutagenesis and obtained clearly discernible results irrespective of the concentrations of wild type and mutant plasmids or the ratio in which they had been mixed. the clinical samples tested in this assay were isolated from humans, tigers, leopard, cat, dog and various avian species previously infected with h5n1. two human specimens in this experiment were investigated. the first one isolated from human plasma and collected in nakhon-nayok province showed a positive result for the wild type only. in contrast, the second one obtained from a vietnamese patient previously reported by le et al. (2005) emitted signals specific for both wild type and mutant. the remaining specimens originating from tiger lung, spleen, kidney and liver, leopard brain and the allantoic fluid of various avian species, cat and dog displayed positive results specific for the wild type only.three specimens, treated with oseltamivir, were chosen to be cloned into plasmids for confirmation. the first specimen was from a tiger (a/tiger/thailand/cu-t7/04) isolated from zoo tigers that had perished during the mid-october 2004 h5n1 influenza outbreak. cu-t7 was isolated from a nasal swab of a tiger that eventually perished but had been treated with oseltamivir at 75 mg/60 kg twice daily for 4 days prior to specimen collection (amonsin et al., 2006; thanawongnuwech et al., 2005) and inoculated into san-fowl eggs according to the method described by the office international des epizooties (oie). ten clones of cu-t7 were randomly selected and sequenced. all the clones were sensitive to oseltamivir. the second specimen was white tiger (a/tiger/thailand/ku-11/04) was isolated from a sick white tiger found positive for h5n1 by nasal swab and subsequently treated with oseltamivir at 75 mg/60 kg twice daily for 4 days. this tiger survived and a rectal swab was taken. this specimen was inoculated into sanfowl eggs. ten clones of ku-11 were randomly selected and sequenced. all the clones were sensitive to oseltamivir. the third specimen was cdna from a vietnamese patient (le et al., 2005) . ten clones of this strain were randomly selected and sequenced. nine of the 10 clones were resistant to oseltamivir and only 1 clone was sensitive.the specificity of the assay by cross-contamination tests were evaluated and found no cross-reactivity to total human dna, any of the different na subtypes of influenza a virus, newcastle disease virus (ndv), respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) subgroups a and b, human metapneumovirus (hmpv), coronavirus oc43, coronavirus 229e, infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv) and infectious bronchitis virus (ibv). likewise, any significant false positive or non-specific signal in any of the samples tested was not observed. overall, the results obtained on oseltamivir resistance with the two labeled probes indicate a high specificity of both primers and probes used for amplification. as for the sensitivity of real-time pcr, the threshold concentration for detecting both wild type (h274) and mutant (274y) was 10 copies/l. furthermore, in order to establish the limits of real-time pcr to detect both wild type and mutant in the same sample, wild type and mutant plasmids were mixed in various ratios and diluted them over a range of concentrations 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100 ratios of wild type and mutant. the result showed the high sensitivity of the detection that can be detected although the reaction had 7.5:2.5 plasmid copies/l of wild type and mutant.at present, there is a substantial risk of a global influenza a virus subtype h5n1 epidemic not only affecting poultry but also mammalian species including humans. a medication capable of preventing the spread to humans is the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. yet, influenza a virus subtype h5n1 has already developed drug resistance by mutations in the neuraminidase gene leading to amino acid substitutions predominantly at positions 119, 152, 274 and 292 (n2 numbering system) of the enzyme's active site (gubareva et al., 2000) . the amino acid substitution at position 274 identified in mutants selected in the presence of na inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro has exclusively been found in n1 (gubareva et al., 2002) . in 2005, h5n1 virus resistant to oseltamivir due to an amino acid change from histidine (h) to tyrosine (y) based on a single nucleotide alteration at position 274 has been isolated from three vietnamese patients one of whom, a 14 years old, recovered (le et al., 2005) while the remaining two, a 13 and 18 years old, succumbed to the infection (de jong et al., 2005) . hence, patients found positive for h5n1 infection ought to be monitored for the nucleotide change at position 274 causing resistance to oseltamivir before the onset of treatment. with the mutation detected in time, alternative treatment applying, for example zanamivir might save the patient's life.in this experiment, both probes and primers were specifically designed to detect the nucleotide change causing oseltamivir resistance. the amino acid substitution of histidine (h) with tyrosine (y) is the consequence of a single nucleotide in the first codon of this amino acid change from c to t. the alignment of theh5n1 neuraminidase gene sequence with more than 200 sequences stored in the genbank database showed a nucleotide change in the specific probe area yet at a position not triggering the critical amino acid alteration. hence, the probe was designed to allow for this inconsequential mutation by using a degenerate nucleotide at that position thus closely mimicking the natural situation. moreover, since the conserved area of the gene restricted the probe's length to 17 nucleotides taqman mgb was chosen. the probe was coupled with a minor groove binder enhancing its tm and had a non-fluorescent quencher attached to the 3 end, which does not interfere with fluorescent signal detection. after having tested the probes with the mutagenesis control, the result showed high sensitivity and correct distinction between wild type and mutant upon mixing different ratios of wild type and mutant plasmid at low concentrations.in conclusion, real-time pcr using two labeled taqman probes provides a highly specific and sensitive method to detect the amino acid alteration at position 274 of the influenza a subtype h5n1 neuraminidase gene causing oseltamivir resistance. studies as the one described here could address the potential differences in diagnostic outcomes between patients who develop detectable oseltamivir resistance and patients who retain only the wild type strain of h5n1. however, the other point mutations of oseltamivir resistance in h5n1 infected mammalian species need for the further investigation.subsequent diarrhea in young and immunonaive dogs, due to viral tropism to rapidly multiplying cells, such as enterocytes in the intestinal crypts [3, 11] . successful vaccination programs using live attenuated cpv-2 vaccines exist, but controversies arise between dog owners, veterinarians and vaccine companies when diarrhea occurs within a few days of cpv-2 vaccine administration [4] . reversion of the vaccine virus to a virulent cpv-2 virus has not been documented and is considered unlikely [3] . it has been postulated that clinical signs of canine parvovirus a few days after cpv-2 vaccination result from a different disease, or from a wild virulent cpv-2 subtypes incubating at the time of vaccination [3] . diagnosing parvoviral enteritis in dogs is essential to ensuring suitable barrier nursing protocols within veterinary hospitals. the current diagnostic trend is to use multiplexed pcr panels to detect an array of pathogens that commonly cause diarrhea in dogs [6] . the multiplexed pcr assays do not distinguish wild from vaccine cpv-2. they are highly sensitive and detect even a low level of virus shedding, such as those caused by the cpv-2 vaccine [6] . interpretation of test results is based on quantitation of the viral load (quantitative pcr) and clinical presentation including commonly found panleucopenia on peripheral blood. in fatal cases structural evidence can be utilized to complement qpcr and hematology to confirm parvoviral enteritis, however the aim is accurate antemortem diagnosis that rapidly differentiates vaccine associated viral presence from wild-type parvoviral enteritis.canine parvovirus (cpv-2) emerged as a canine pathogen in the late 1970s. in the 1980s, two antigenic variants emerged (cpv-2a and cpv-2b) and eventually completely replaced the original cpv-2 [9] . cpv-2 is still used in many commercial vaccines with some more recently replacing this with cpv-2b. differentiation of cpv-2 viruses is based on viral capsid protein sequence (vp2). the original cpv-2 differs in five or six amino acid residues from cpv-2a and cpv-2b [2, 3] , and there are only two amino acid residues differentiating cpv-2a from cpv-2b [11] . a more recently discovered strain (cpv-2c) is defined by a further single nucleotide change [3] .the aim of this study was to identify the cpv-2 subtypes detected in diagnostic specimens presented to the veterinary pathology diagnostic service at the university of sydney. diagnostic dilemmas for clinicians not uncommonly include the possibility of occult shedding of cpv-2 vaccine strains in diarrhea of other etiology, and the possibility of vaccine breakdown in the face of emerging cpv-2 subtypes.a small animal fecal pathogens diagnostic multiplexed tandem pcr (mt-pcr) panel (cat. no. 38175 version 1 through version 3, ausdiagnostics, sydney, australia) was implemented at the university of sydney veterinary pathology diagnostic services from 2014. the mt-pcr incorporates a multiplexed initial amplification and a subsequent single-target amplification, using sybr green chemistry in a real-time pcr to detect dna of parvovirus (cpv-2), as well as salmonella, campylobacter, giardia, cryptosporidium, dientamoeba, blastocystis, toxoplasma, feline coronavirus, tritrichomonas, canine distemper virus, and canine coronavirus and is used for both canine and feline fecal samples [10] . the mt-pcr panel includes amplification of host target dna to evaluate sample adequacy, and each processed sample is spiked with proprietary dna and tested for its presence to assess pcr inhibition in the test specimens (http://www.ausdiagnostics.com/, ausdiagnostics pty. ltd., beaconsfield, nsw 2015, australia). for each fecal sample, 250 mg of feces were first homogenized and disrupted in a fastprep-24 homogenisation system equipped with quickprep adapter (mp biomedicals, australia) at a speed setting of 6.0 m/s for 40 s prior to dna isolation. genomic dna was then isolated using powermag ® microbiome rna/dna isolation kit (magnetic separation) (mo-bio laboratories; geneworks, thebarton, australia) optimised for kingfisher ® duo (thermo-fisher scientific, scoresby, australia).a total of 21 samples that tested positive for cpv-2 in the mt-pcr small animal fecal pathogens diagnostic panel during 2014e2016 were included in this study (table 1; supplementary  table 1 ). using the latest version 3 of the mt-pcr panel (see above), 76% (16/21) were cpv-2 positive (table 1) . to evaluate if the cpv-2 dna originated from the vaccine or wild type parvovirus, we partially characterized the vp2 gene of cpv-2 from 43% (9/21) of clinical specimens (eight of which were mt-pcr v3 positive for cpv-2). two overlapping sets of primers hfor/hrev (residues 3556e4166; m38245) and 555for/555rev (residues 4003e4585; m38245) were used, as previously published [2] . review of cpv-2 genome sequences available in genbank revealed poor conservation of 555rev primer site, therefore an alternative primer js-2 (residues 4799e4818; m38245) [8] was used in combination with 555for or hfor as an alternative combination, improving amplification success for 3 samples previously negative using 555for/ 555rev primers ( table 2 ). the amplified region included the diagnostic residues 297, 300, 305, 426 and 555 for typing of cpv-2, cpv-2a, cpv-2b and cpv-2c [3] . the conventional pcr included mytaq red mastermix (bioline, sydney, australia) and were run on a verity pcr cycler (thermo fisher scientific, australia). to match the obtained sequences to vaccine strains of cpv-2, we amplified vp2 from two frequently used live attenuated vaccines (cpv-2b strain, protech c4, boehringer ingelheim, australia; cpv-2, canigen dh a2 p, virbac, australia). all direct dna sequencing with the amplification primers in both directions was done by macrogen (seoul, korea) using amplification primers.vaccine strain cpv-2 (canigen) was detected in four samples, based on 100% match between the vaccine dna sequence and dna amplified from canine fecal samples (table 2) . near identical dna sequences to vaccine strain cpv-2b (protech) were detected in three dog feces ( table 2 , fig. 1 ). the cpv-2b vaccine strain dna had a single mismatch (nucleotide position 4710, m38245) in the noncoding region of the viral dna from the canine cpv-2b dna sequences (15e2425, 15e2378, 16e3871; fig. 1a ). this mismatch was only recognized with 555for/js-2 primers, regions amplified with hfor/hrev and 555fro/555rev were identical with cpv-2b vaccine strain dna. sequence from two samples was consistent with cpv-2a sequence, considered to be a wild subtype (fig. 1ab) . nucleotide sequence was typical for cpv-2a, including (a > g at 4062) nucleotide changes coding for amino acid changes asn-426 > asp differentiating type 2a from type 2b [3] . the cpv-2a subtypes were previously reported to be the most prevalent in dog populations in australia in 2007 [8] . the small scale of the current cohort does not imply the absence of cpv-2b or cpv-2c in australia, subtypes that are now dominant in many other countries. as high as 1450 canine parvovirus disease cases are self-reported by veterinarians in australia annually, through disease watchdog, a national disease surveillance program [7, 12, 13] . investigation targeting recently identified rural areas with increased prevalence of canine parvovirus by ref. [13] ; coupled with genotyping of the cpv-2 subtypes, would facilitate improved understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of individual subtypes under australian conditions. new nucleotide sequences were deposited in genbank under the following accession numbers: ky242639-ky242647.closer inspection of the sequence from a sample (15e2378) suspected to contain vaccine-like cpv-2b, revealed a variable nucleotide 4023 (m38245) (fig. 1ac) . the animal was vaccinated with cpv-2b strain (boehringer ingelheim vaccine) one week prior to the clinical presentation of vomiting and diarrhea. the nucleotide is typically a conserved guanidine in vaccine strains but, in this case, it included overlapping guanidine and adenine residues (fig. 1c) . the remaining vp2 sequence matched the cpv-2b (ex protec vaccine), suggesting presence of vaccine strain with superinfection of a wild cpv-2b or a mutated vaccine strain. this animal (15e2378) was a 4 month old english cocker spaniel with concurrent giardiasis. the snap canine parvovirus antigen test kit (idexx, australia) returned a positive result at the time of sampling. mt-pcr returned a very low (<10) take off time (equivalent of low c t -value) suggesting a large number of viral particles being shed in the patient's feces, unlike the low level shedding of vaccine cpv-2 strains in other dogs (table 1, table 2, supplementary  table 1 ). the dog was released to home care and it is not known whether it represented a biosecurity issue for other dogs. the detected mutation is not reported to cause any change in virulence or strain type [1] . further monitoring and evaluation of cpv-2 sequences is required to elucidate the frequency and origin of the observed mutation.in the mt-pcr assay, low take-off times (<15 cycles) typically suggest presence of a wild cpv-2 subtype as these are typically shed in greater numbers than vaccine strains. in both cases of cpv-2a as well as the above mentioned case (15e2378), the take-off time was very early, providing an initial indication from mt-pcr with the confirmatory evidence of presence of wild-type canine parvovirus in the sample (via conventional pcr and dna sequencing). parvovirus is detected frequently in pcr panels, with 6.8% of 526 diarrheic dogs from australia testing positive for cpv-2 using idexx laboratories proprietary realpcr™ service platform [6] . suggested that a cutoff value of 1.2 million cpv-2 gene equivalents per gram of stool discriminates vaccine strains from wild type cpv-2 infections. the load itself is a valuable outcome as it enables veterinarians to put appropriate quarantine measures in place to contain the spread of the highly resilient virus. on the other hand, higher take-off times were indicative of presence of vaccine strain, because vaccine virus is able to replicate in the dog's intestinal mucosa and shed into the feces [4, 5] .discriminating vaccine strain from a wild type viruses of cpv-2 is ambitious in urgent diagnostics, as previously argued [4] . in this study, we have typed cpv-2 detected in canine feces by mt-pcr panel, using partial vp2 amplification and dna sequencing. the approach has demonstrated some limitations to the commonly used assay, in particular with the application of the 555rev primer. a yardstick approach to a copy number or c t -value to discriminate vaccine strain from a wild type viruses of cpv-2 can be, in some cases, potentially misleading.keywords human metapneumovirus; epidemiology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; adult; respiratory infection summary objective: to evaluate the prevalence and clinical manifestations of human metapneumovirus (hmpv) in immunocompetent chinese adults with acute respiratory tract infections (artis). methods: a reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) assay targeting the p gene was developed in this study and used to detect hmpv in nasal and throat swabs collected from 2936 immunocompetent adult patients with artis in beijing, china between july 2008 and june 2010. results: among the 2936 patients studied, 49 (1.7%) were positive for hmpv, of whom 14 (28.6%) were positive for hmpv_a2b, 19 (38.8%) for hmpv_b1, and 16 (32.6%) for hmpv_b2. hmpv_a1 was not detected. an average detection rate of 6.6% was observed in the peak months of the two epidemic seasons studied. the hmpv prevalence was higher in the introduction human metapneumovirus (hmpv) is a single-stranded, negative sense rna virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family and pneumovirus subfamily. 41 the hmpv genome, approximately 13 kb in length, encodes six genes, which produce at least eight proteins, including nucleocapsid (n), phosphoprotein (p), matrix protein (m), fusion glycoprotein (f), transcriptional enhancer protein (m2-1), small hydrophobic protein (sh), attachment glycoprotein (g), and large polymerase protein (l). based on the phylogeny of the g gene, hmpv is divided into two genotypes (a and b) and further into four subtypes (a1, a2, b1, and b2). 3, 28 a novel sublineage a2b was identified in children in germany in 2006. 21 hmpv infection evokes incomplete immunity and reinfection can occur in people of all ages. 10, 14, 15, 35, 42, 43 prevalent worldwide, hmpv is an important respiratory pathogen that manifests in young children less than 5 years of age. 4, 11, 25, 32, 34, 38, 39 clinical symptoms caused by hmpv infection are similar to respiratory syncytial virus and include fever, cough, wheezing, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, sputum production, and asthma. 6, 12, 32 rates of hmpv infection range from 5.5% to 25% among children hospitalized with respiratory illness. 18e20, 25 in adults, the clinical manifestations of hmpv infection seem to depend on age and health conditions. in young adults (aged 14e25 years), the clinical symptoms of hmpv infection are similar to those of other respiratory viral infections. in contrast, in middle aged (aged 26e65 years) and healthy elderly adults (aged > 65 years), hmpv presents similarly to influenza infections and common colds. 13 although the incidence of hmpv infection in healthy adults during winter is generally less than 6%, 5, 23, 30, 42 hmpv is considered to be a major contributor to the burden of respiratory illnesses in older adults. 42 most studies of hmpv infection in adults have focused on the elderly and on immunocompromised people rather than on immunocompetent adults of all age groups. although hmpv infection has been reported in healthy adults during winter seasons, 5, 14 further study of hmpv infection in healthy adults is needed during all seasons in consecutive years to evaluate the circulation patterns, clinical features, and clinical burden of hmpv infection in a given population. in this study, we developed a reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) assay to evaluate the prevalence of hmpv infection in healthy adults with acute respiratory tract infections (ar-tis) in beijing, china. clinical presentations and phylogenetic characteristics of hmpv infection were also investigated.nasal and throat swabs were collected from adults with suspected viral artis who sought medical attention at the fever outpatient clinic of the peking union medical college hospital, beijing, china over the period between july 2008 and june 2010. enrollment criteria of patients have been described previously. 36 briefly, patients over 14 years of age with acute respiratory symptoms, acute fever (body temperature s38.0 c), and normal or low leukocyte count were enrolled. about 22 patients met these criteria each day on average (in total 16,663). of these, 4e5 patients were enrolled daily based on random selection by clinicians in most months during the study period. a total of 2936 patients were enrolled in this study. immediately after collection, nasal and throat swabs from the same patient were combined in one tube containing 3 ml viral transport medium (vtm) and stored at à80 c prior to analysis. samples were collected only once from each enrolled patient.total rna and dna were extracted from 200 ml vtm, using the nuclisens easymagä platform (biomérieux, marcy 1'etoile, france) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 8 rt-pcr was used to detect hmpv in this study. a pair of primers targeting the p gene of hmpv was designed to generate an amplicon of 240 bp. sequences of the forward and reverse primers were: 5 0 -tyaacattgcwacag-caggacc-3 0 and 5 0 -cttcwgattcwccrcttgtgct-3 0 , corresponding to nt 1834e1855 and nt 2052e2073 of hmpv gz01 strain (genbank accession no gq153651), respectively. rt-pcr was performed using the one-step rt-pcr kit (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). following the manufacturer's instructions, a 5 ml aliquot of the extracted total nucleic acids was used as the template. the rt-pcr assay consisted of initial reverse transcription at 48 c for 45 min and preamplification at 94 c for 3 min, followed by 35cycles of amplification at 94 c for 30 s, at 55 c for 30 s, and at 72 c for 30 s, and an additional extension at 72 c for 10 min. all pcr products of the expected size were verified by sequence analysis. the hmpv subtypes were identified by alignment of the pcr sequence with the corresponding reference sequences from genbank database, using blast program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi). other common respiratory viruses in clinical specimens were simultaneously detected using rt-pcr or pcr assays, as described previously, 36 including influenza viruses (a, b and c), parainfluenza viruses (type 1e4), rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (oc43, 229e, nl63 and hku1) and respiratory syncytial virus. to avoid potential crosscontamination, master-mix preparation, nucleic acid extraction, assembly of the pcr reaction, and detection of the pcr products were performed in separate areas. strict controls for nucleic acid extraction and pcr amplification were also included.the full-length p gene (885 bp; genbank accession number hq889777) of hmpv was amplified from clinical samples by rt-pcr and cloned into the pgem-t easy vector (promega, madison, wi). prior to in vitro transcription, the plasmid was purified and linearized using the restriction enzyme not i (takara, dalian, china), and was then extracted by ethanol precipitation. the linearized plasmids were subsequently used as templates for in vitro rna transcription using t7 rna-polymerase (ambion, austin, tx). after the transcription reaction, the rna was treated with dnase (promega) and purified using the transcript rna clean up kit (takara). the concentration of the rnas was determined using a nanodrop nd-1000 photo spectrometer (thermo fisher scientific, wilmington, de). the quantified rnas were then diluted 10-fold in 2.5 mg/ml of yeast trna (ambion) and used as template for one-step rt-pcr.to evaluate the specificity of the rt-pcr assay, propagated respiratory viruses were used as negative controls. these viruses included influenza viruses a/h1n1 2009 and a/h3n2, influenza b, coronaviruses 229e and oc43, adenovirus 5, 7 and 35, and parainfluenza 3.the hmpv strains detected in this study were subtyped based on phylogenetic analysis of the amplicons of p genes using the clustalw alignment implemented in mega 4.0 software. 40 the neighbor-joining method with a kimura-2 parameter model and 1000 bootstrap were applied for phylogenetic analysis.highest body temperature, age, clinical manifestation, laboratory parameters, and annual incidences of each hmpv subtype were compared using either the c 2 -test or fisher's exact test for categorical variables and using the student's-test for continuous variables. p < 0.05 was considered significant.genbank accession numbers for the nucleotide sequences of the partial hmpv p genes identified in this study are hq889776 through hq889824. the genbank accession numbers for the reference sequences of hmpv_a1 are af371337 and ay530092. those for hmpv_a2 are ab503857, ay297749, ay530090, ay530091, ay 530093, ay530095, dq843659, fj168779, gq153651, and nc_004148. those for hmpv_b1 are ay525843, ay530089, and ay530094. those for hmpv_b2 are ay297748, dq843658, ef535506, and fj168778.sensitivity and specificity of the rt-pcr assayto evaluate the prevalence of hmpv infection in adults, we developed an rt-pcr assay targeting the hmpv p gene in order to detect the hmpv genotypes a and b. the limit of detection (lod) of the rt-pcr assay was 52 molecules per reaction when the rna templates of the full-length p gene were obtained from in vitro transcription and used as standards for quantification. no cross reactivity of the developed primers was observed when stocks of other respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses a/h1n1 2009 and a/h3n2, influenza b, coronaviruses 229e and oc43, adenovirus 5, 7 and 35, and parainfluenza 3, were tested (data not shown). in addition, our sequence analysis showed that all amplicons generated from the clinical specimens collected for this study were specific for the hmpv p gene, further indicating the specificity of this rt-pcr assay.a total of 2936 patients ranging from 14 to 90 years old (median 29 years; mean 33.9 years) were enrolled in this study. of those patients, 1347 were males (46%) and 1589 were females (54%). hmpv rna was detected in 49 (1.7%) patients, of whom 14 (28.6%) were positive for hmpv_a2, 19 (38.8%) for hmpv_b1, and 16 (32.6%) for hmpv_b2. hmpv_a1 was not detected in any of the patients. the detection rate of hmpv was less than that of influenza virus (27.6%), rhinovirus (6.6%), enterovirus (2.6%), and parainfluenza virus (2.1%), but higher than that of respiratory syncytial virus (1.5%), adenovirus (1.3%), and coronavirus (1.2%).the hmpv-positive patients ranged from 16 to 90 years of age (median 42 years; mean 44 years). the ratio of hmpvpositive maleefemale patients was 1.18:2.07 (c 2 z 3.47, p z 0.06). thus, hmpv infection does not show a gender preference in the healthy adults screened. the overall detection rate of hmpv did not vary significantly between the two study years of july 2008ejune 2009 and july 2009ejune 2010 (c 2 z 0.01, p z 0.93; table 1 ).hmpv infection was detected in all age groups sampled (14e25 years, 26e65 years, and >65 years). however, the detection rates of hmpv in different age groups varied significantly (c 2 z 7.19, p z 0.03), with the elderly (>65 years) showing the highest detection rate of 3.2% (table 2) ; the detection rate in middle aged adults (26e65 years, 2.0%) was significantly higher than that in teenagers (14e25 years, 0.9%; c 2 z 4.98, p z 0.03). 13 other common respiratory viruses were simultaneously screened. co-detection of hmpv with other viruses was found in six (12.2%) patients, five with upper and one with lower respiratory tract infection. influenza virus type a and enterovirus were co-detected with hmpv_b1. influenza virus types a and b were co-detected with hmpv_b2. no other respiratory viruses were co-detected with hmpv_a2 ( table 3) . among the 49 hmpv-positive patients, 47 (95.9%) were diagnosed with an upper respiratory tract infection and 2 (4.1%) were diagnosed with a lower respiratory tract infection. no hmpv-positive patients enrolled in this study were admitted to hospital. clinical symptoms included myalgia (49.0%), rhinorrhea (61.2%), sneezing (51.0%), cough (61.2%), sputum production (51.0%), sore throat (67.3%), chills (83.7%), headache (71.4%), muscle pain (44.9%), and sneezing (51.0%). vomiting was observed in only one patient infected with hmpv_b2 (table 3) . body temperatures were similar among patients infected with different hmpv subtypes (data not shown). laboratory examination showed no significant difference in the granulocytes, mean lymphocyte count, percentage of neutrophilic granulocytes, or percentage of lymphocytes between patients positive for different hmpv subtypes.a phylogenetic tree was constructed for all strains of hmpv_a2, hmpv_b1, and hmpv_b2 identified in this study, based on clustalw alignment (implemented in mega) of the 240 bp amplicons of the hmpv p gene. strains of each subtype clustered together (fig. 2) , indicating that the target region of the established rt-pcr assay contains enough variability for hmpv genotyping. moreover, all hmpv_a2 strains, which can be divided into hmpv_a2a and a2b clusters, 22 were only found in the hmpv_a2b cluster in this study. pairwise distance compute of the targeting p gene between our sample sequences and reference sequences from genbank (see fig. 2 legend) shows that hmpv_a2 strains identified in this study had 97.4%e100% identity of both nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences. hmpv_b1 had 93.1%e100% and 93.3%e100% identity of nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences whereas hmpv_b2 had 90.6%e100% and 88.2%e100% nucleotide and amino acid identity, respectively.in this study, we used an rt-pcr assay to screen clinical specimens collected from adults with artis. the hmpv p gene is an ideal molecular target for detection and genotyping of hmpv, because its conserved sequences allow specific detection using rt-pcr and enough variability to permit distinction between genotypes. 3, 28 four subtypes of hmpv and two clusters of hmpv_a2 were clearly distinguished through our phylogenetic analysis of hmpv p gene fragments. all strains of hmpv_a2 were found to be hmpv_a2b.the sensitivity of the rt-pcr assay was determined to be 52 copies per reaction, which is at least as sensitive as reported for real-time rt-pcr assays previously. 24, 29 the primer pair used in this study can also be applied to an sybr green rt-pcr system for quick screening of clinical specimens for hmpv, based on data obtained from about 400 clinical specimens comparing sybr green rt-pcr and standard rt-pcr analysis (data not shown). no cross reactivity was observed for other propagated respiratory viruses, indicating high specificity of the primer pair under the rt-pcr conditions used.we observed an annual incidence of 1.7% for hmpv infection in immunocompetent adults with artis, sampled over a period of two consecutive years in china. similar annual incidences have been reported in the united states of america, 19 the united kingdom, 16 and in cambodia. 4 although the winter-spring season is traditionally regarded as the typical epidemic season of hmpv in temperate regions, 5, 7, 14, 18, 23, 30, 42 the results of our study show that the hmpv epidemic peaked during the winterespring season (novemberefebruary) of 2008e2009 and the springsummer season (marchejune) of 2010. the hmpv seasonality observed in this study is comparable to that reported in japan, 31 which showed a biennial rhythm of hmpv seasonality, with the epidemic peaking between november and march in odd years and between march and june in the successive even years. 1, 2, 31 our results indicate that hmpv seasonality in adults is similar to that in children.the reason for this differing seasonality is unclear. previous studies have shown that climate can affect seasonality. 4, 7, 17, 33, 37 however, the climate records for beijing do not indicate significant variability between the same months of each study year (data not shown). it is possible that the pandemic of a/h1n1/2009 affected the circulation of hmpv during the 2010 season. based on our findings, the surveillance of hmpv infection in immunocompetent adults should be extended from the winter season to year round to improve our understanding of the burden of hmpv infection.hmpv_a1 was not detected in the patients sampled for this study. the absence of hmpv_a1 in this study is consistent with other reports. 4, 9, 26, 27 indeed, circulation of hmpv genotypes has been reported to vary annually, with replacement of predominant genotypes occurring every 1e3 years in a given population. such genotype replacement is believed to result from adaptive immunity of a population to the predominant circulating genotype. 1, 17, 22 in this study, analysis of the incidences of hmpv subtypes shows that hmpv_a (represented by hmpv_a2) was declining whereas hmpv_b (hmpv_b1 and b2) was rising from july 2008 to june 2010. thus, it is possible that hmpv_a1 was in its troughs during the study period. a longer study period would be required to investigate the prevalence patterns of hmpv subtypes.children and elderly adults (>65 years) are reportedly at higher risk of hmpv infection due to incomplete immunity. 7, 13, 14 in this study, the detection rate of hmpv (3.2%) was highest in the elderly (>65 years) compared to that in other adult age groups, consistent with previous reports. 12, 14, 23 in contrast to previous reports, 13, 14, 35, 42 the detection rate of hmpv in teenagers (14e25 year, 0.9%) was significantly lower than that in middle aged adults (26e65 years, 2.0%) in our study. the reason for this disparity is unclear. further studies are needed to clarify the age distribution of hmpv infection in adults.we observed a moderate detection rate of hmpv in chinese adults, lower than that of influenza virus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus, but higher than that of respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus. if the observed data is extrapolated from the sampled subjects to the whole population, 1.7% could be translated to a significant number of hmpv arti cases in china every year.in summary, this study reports the detection of hmpv and a large-scale, detailed analysis of the prevalence and clinical symptoms of hmpv infection in healthy adults with artis in beijing, china. a biennial rhythm of hmpv seasonality in immunocompetent adults was observed, as was a higher detection rate of hmpv in adults aged >65 compared to those in other adult age groups screened in this study. our results improve current understanding of the pathogenesis of hmpv in healthy adults. however, as this study covered a limited population and a relatively short time period, further investigations are required to characterize the infection of different hmpv subtypes in adults more thoroughly.middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) is a unique positive-sense single-stranded rna (þssrna) virus belonging to the genus betacoronavirus (world health organization, 2014) . previously, it was called novel coronavirus 2012 because it was isolated in 2012 by genomic sequencing from sputum of a patient, during the 2012 outbreak of new flu (zaki et al. 2012) .until august 2015, mers-cov outbreaks were reported in more than 21 nations like saudi arabia, jordan, egypt, qatar, uae, turkey, kuwait, oman, bangladesh, indonesia, algeria, south korea, philippines, thailand, usa, uk and austria (abdullah et al. 2016) . according to the european center for disease prevention and control, it was estimated that out of a total of 1082 mers-cov cases, there were 439 deaths thereby mortality rate leading to whooping 41% . as per the world health organization estimates, the fatality rate surged to 37%. mers-cov patients have acquired this deadly infection through various sources, namely, infected humans, camels, bats, other domesticated animals and pets (world health organization, 2015) . the very nature and special feature of coronavirus is its ability to undergo rapid genetic rearrangement and profound molecular variation in its ssrna. this rearrangement and variation of the viral genome resulting in new antigenic subtypes, leads to difficulties in developing vaccines and therapeutic interventions (chu et al. 2016) . hence, mers-cov poses serious threat not only to the middle east region, but also throughout the world, as a whole.genomes of mers-cov are phylogenetically grouped into clade a and clade b. initially, reported mers-cov cases belonged to clade a (jordan-n3/2012), recently, the newly reported cases were shown to be genetically different, as such, they were named as clade b. based on molecular, genetic and antigenic studies, it was established that mers-cov is unique and different from severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus and common cold coronaviruses. because of this fact, earlier mers-cov was called "saudi sars" (azhar et al. 2016) . this notorious virus was first identified and isolated in saudi arabia by dr ali mohamed zaki from a patient suffering from pneumonia-like illness, and these isolates exhibited cytopathic effects like syncytia formation. through molecular clock analysis, zoonotic transmission was established from dromedary camels (camelus dromedaries), particularly prevailing in middle east countries.both mers-cov and sars coronavirus have similar þssrna in their genome.this ssrna in mers-cov encodes structural proteins (sps), membrane protein (m), envelope (e), nucleocapsid (n), two nonstructural replicase polyproteins (orf1a and orf1b) and spike (s) (reusken et al. 2016) . the two non-structural proteins (nsps) initiate genomic replication and rna synthesis. the huge replicase gene surrounds 5 0 proximal side of rna genome. translation of orf1a gives rise to polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and ribosomal frame shifting makes translation of orf1b to give pp1ab. mers-cov uses one or two papain-like protease to release nsps. it is established that mers-cov possesses 16 nsps (firth and brierley, 2015) .viral components like nsps, sps, m, e, n, s and other proteins, glycoproteins and enzymes play a crucial role in virulence in establishing and exaggerating the disease (figure 1 ).mers-cov's e protein is responsible for the attachment of virus particles to host cell receptors. s protein is in charge of fusion and entry in to the respiratory epithelia .virus-induced proteases help viral particles to spread to lower parts of the lungs, thus enhancing the severity of the infection. it results in inflammation and suppression of anti-viral interferons (ifn). at this point of the infection, there is excessive anti-viral immune responses like interleukins (il-6, il-8 and tnf-a), humoral igg and igm are inefficient to control the viral spread and replication in the lungs. the very nature of mers-cov virus ability to overcome and suppress host immune challenge is due to its þssrna, viral sps and nsps .mers-cov exhibits its degree of pathogenicity based on the host. it elicits maximum pathogenic potential, especially in humans. this is due to the fact that mers-cov shows a strong tropism for bronchial non-ciliated epithelia. during this time, it is proved that virus also arrests host bronchial ifn synthesis (coleman et al. 2015; mielech et al. 2016) . at this juncture, it should be noted that most of other viruses causing respiratory diseases attack and damage epithelial cilia, including influenza type a. studies revealed that cellular receptors for mers-cov is exopeptidase (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) (coleman et al. 2015) . moreover, it was found that neutralization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 by specific antibodies did not arrest the spread of infection into bronchus and lung alveolus. extensive studies showed that another functional cellular receptors called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 were also involved in the severity of disease spread in the lungs due to mers-cov (de wit et al. 2015) . moreover, receptors for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 are also located in nephrons of kidneys and heart. during the acute stage of the mers-cov infection, there is severe viremia, leading to the spread of mers-cov virus particles in blood stream. at this point, mers-cov exhibits the hall mark of infection leading to not only to the damage of lungs but also kidneys and heart, thereby resulting in respiratory, renal and cardiac failure, ultimately leading to coma and death (vanboheemen et al. 2016) . the severity is worsened by concurrent secondary bacterial infections. recent research showed that bacterial infections due to staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae type b augment the pathogenic potential of mers-cov, particularly in humans. these bacteria particularly dwell in the oral cavities, tonsils and pharynx of humans . another interesting fact is that the reservoir host dromedary camels and other animals do not exhibit the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 receptors in their kidneys and heart. in humans, after the entry of mers-cov viral particles in to lung alveoles, alveolar macrophages fail to contain the spread of infection. the strong host cellular immune response and cytokine release lead to inflammation and fluid accumulation in lungs. this will result in the characteristic symptoms of mers-cov; high fever, chills, rigors, severe cough, dyspnoea and hypovolemic shock . many patients exhibited common symptoms of pneumonia, whereas a significant number of patients expressed symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome like disease. another large number of patients also revealed laryngotracheobronchitis, which is called "croup". the patterns of disease due to mers-cov also differed among different age groups. clinical cases, morbidity and mortality rates due to mers-cov infections are more common and high (80%) in the age group of 35e45 years. astonishingly, the severity of mers-cov is lower (40%) in the higher age groups, particularly above 55 years (lei et al. 2015) .epidemiology and mode of spread of mers-cov play a crucial role in morbidity and fatality due to these life-threatening viruses. different ways of transmission of mers-cov have been documented (corman et al. 2015) . they include dromedary camel to human mode, bats to camels, among camels, cattle to man, dogs to humans, cats to man, bats to humans and finally man to man transmission. human to human spread is very effective and common in close contacts and crowded surroundings. nosocomial, hospital-borne outbreaks have also been reported in many instances. there have been reported incidences of spread from patients to health care workers (song et al. 2015) . in mers-cov epidemiology, dromedary camels play an important role because these animals act as reservoir host. dromedary camels also act as "gene mixing vessels". when two different strains of mers-cov, from two different sources, infect dromedary camels, these two genetically different mers-cov exchange their þssrna resulting in the development (mutation) of new subtypes of mers-cov. the stunning features of these new subtypes of mers-cov have new antigens and novel virulence genes. in saudi arabia, there were possible cases of human transmission after drinking camel milk. but, there are no cases documented in humans through ingestion of camel meat (de wit et al. 2016) .patients suffering from mers exhibited low white blood cell count in particular of low lymphocytes. confirmation and rapid molecular testing can be performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) test. rt-pcr testing can be performed on bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum and tracheal aspirates. serological test like immunofluorescence technique (ift) is also useful. but, the main issue with ift is many other serologically related viruses may cross-react with mers-cov antibodies. so, ift is unsuitable for confirmation. world health organization recommends rt-pcr for the confirmation of mers-cov in clinical samples (b aez-santos et al. 2014 ).because the main transmission is through camels, people should be advised to handle camels with precautions, especially camels with severe nasal discharge. other general health care measures should be taken to arrest nosocomial hospital-borne mers-cov outbreaks. for the treatment of mers-cov cases, administration of ribavirin and ifn-a2b was found to be promising, but not very effective. researchers are recently investigating many ways to overcome the outbreak of mers-cov. many drugs are under evaluation (ifn, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, camostat, mycophenolic acid and lopinavir (de wit et al. 2016) .mers-cov causes severe, life threatening and rapidly spreading middle east respiratory syndrome not only in middle east region, but throughout the world. dromedary camels and bats play an important role in the spread of mers-cov. several nosocomial infections due to mers-cov have also been reported worldwide. several viral sps and nsps are critical for the molecular virulence of mers-cov. because of the þssrna, mers-cov can undergo molecular rearrangement leading to antigenic change, genetic variation and mutation. this attributes to the emergence of new and novel subtypes of mers-cov in the human populations. these unique subtypes are difficult to control by vaccinations and therapeutic intervention strategies. another important issue faced by scientists and molecular virologists is related to these new mers-cov viral particles which possess enhanced molecular virulence, thus leading to increased pathogenicity and a more rapid spread than their parental strains. studies revealed that dromedary camels act as "gene mixing vessels" for mers-cov. prevention is mainly based on avoiding contact with dromedary camels and focussing on nosocomial infection outbreaks. researchers are constantly trying to develop anti-viral drugs to combat mers-cov, but till today there is no breakthrough. the perspective of what can we expect in the future of this field is developing effective vaccine, conducting detailed studies on molecular research on mechanism of mutation and genetic recombination occurring in mers-cov.severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is the infectious agent of coronavirus disease 2019 . starting from the first case recorded in wuhan (china) in december 2019, sars-cov-2 quickly spread around the world, leading the world health organization to declare pandemic [1] . to date, june 6th, 2020, the confirmed cases in the world are around 6.6 million and more than 390,000 deaths [2] .covid-19 is a systemic infection that usually presents with fatigue and fever. the most frequent symptoms described are respiratory and gastrointestinal [3] . however, neurological complications have recently been reported, including dizziness, headache, febrile seizures, myalgia, encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and acute peripheral nerve diseases [4, 5] .some cases of acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (amsan) and acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (aidp) subtypes of guillain-barré syndrome (gbs) have recently been described. gbs is an acute immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy often related to previous infectious exposure [6] [7] [8] . clinically, gbs is characterized by limbs or cranial-nerve weakness, loss of deep tendon reflexes, sensory, and dysautonomic symptoms due to peripheral nerves and root demyelination and/or axonal damage [9] . about 60% of all gbs are preceded by respiratory or a gastrointestinal [10] .we reported a case of covid-19 patient with aidp subtype of gbs, associating a literature review on the sars-cov-2 and gbs etiological correlation.on april 26th, 2020, a 68-year-old man presented to the emergency department with symptoms of acute progressive symmetric ascending flaccid tetraparesis. patient medical history included dyslipidemia, benign prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, and abdominal aortic aneurysm in follow-up. ten days before admission, dry cough associated with fever, dysgeusia, and hyposmia appeared. neurological manifestations started 5 days later with progressive acute weakness of distal lower extremities.on admission, oxygen saturation was 96% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths/min, and the body temperature was 37.2°c. chest computed tomography highlighted a bilateral basilar ground glass opacity, with oropharyngeal swab positive for sars-cov-2 on reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay. no pathological findings were auscultated on pulmonary objective examination.the patient was then isolated and antiviral drugs have been started. neurological examination showed bifacial nerve palsy (house-brackmann grade 3) and muscular weakness, with a medical research council scale of 1/5 in proximal and 2/5 in distal of the lower limbs. the osteo-tendon reflexes were hypoactive with bilateral areflexia to the achilles tendons. no sensory deficit was recorded. upper motor neuron disorder or meningeal irritation signs have not been found.baseline laboratoristic analysis showed thrombocytopenia (101 × 10 9 /l, reference value: 125-300 × 10 9 /l) and lymphocytopenia (0.48 × 10 9 /l, reference value: 1.1-3.2 × 10 9 /l). cerebrospinal fluid assessment showed an albuminocytologic dissociation with increased protein level (98 mg/dl, reference value: 8-43 mg/dl) and normal cell count (2 × 10 6 /l, reference value: 0-8 × 10 6 /l). additional serological tests (i.e., ana, anti-dna, c-anca, p-anca, campylobacter jejuni, mycoplasma pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, influenza virus a and b, human immunodeficiency virus) were negative. normal serum vitamin b12 level and serum protein electrophoresis were found.four days after neurological symptoms and signs onset, motor nerve conduction studies showed delayed distal latencies and absent f waves in early course, supporting demyelinating pattern in accordance with gbs diagnostic criteria (table 1) . sensory nerve conduction showed nerve action potentials; the recorded values were all in range, in line with the patient clinic.a diagnosis of guillain-barré syndrome was then made. intravenous immunoglobulin was administered at a dose of 0.4 g/kg for 5 days. thrombocytopenia and lymphocytopenia progressively returned in the following days, with complete resolution of the admission radiological pulmonary findings. the improvement of the respiratory and laboratory clinic was followed by a progressive recovery of limb strength and a return to osteo-tendon normoreflexia. thirty days after hospitalization, following the negative result of the oropharyngeal swab for sars-cov-2, the patient was discharged to continue the rehabilitation program at home.we described a case of acute progressive symmetric ascending flaccid tetraparesis in a covid-19 patient with diagnosis of aidp subtype of gbs. the anamnestic, clinical, electrophysiological, and laboratory evidence leads to a likely causal association with sars-cov-2.starting from the first case of gbs sars-cov-2 infectionrelated described by zhao h. et al. [11] , a series of cases have been reported in the literature, supporting the post-infectious and para-infectious etiopathological correlation between sars-cov-2 and this acute polyradiculoneuropathy ( table 2) . a systematic review of the literature on gbs and its correlation with sars-cov-2 infection was performed. multiple searches were made on pubmed and scopus by cross-referencing the following keywords: "guillan-barrè", "guillan-barrè syndrome", "covid-19", "sars-cov-2", "para-infectious", "post-infectious", "molecular mimicry", "neuropathy", "flaccid", "polyradiculoneuropathy", "ace-2", "pathogenesis". other pertinent articles were retrieved through reference analysis. inclusion criteria were the report of gbs clinical manifestation in covid-19 patients. to date, june 6th, 2020, 16 papers have been published regarding the gbs-sars-cov-2 correlation. adding up all the cases reported in the literature, 23 covid-19 patients with gbs have been described, including our case report. there was no gender prevalence, and the average age of the patients was 61 years. a slight prevalence of aidp over amsan subtype was observed. post-infectious cases were predominant over para-infectious cases.gbs is an acute flaccid paralytic disease that most commonly presents with progressive symmetric weakness and areflexia. gbs usually occurs following a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection, with a presentation latency varying between 3 days and 6 weeks [9] . the supposed pathophysiological mechanism is the "molecular mimicry", an aberrant autoimmune response to a preceding infection which evokes a cross-reaction against the peripheral nerve antigens (e.g. production of anti-ganglioside antibodies in amsan gbs subtype preceded by campylobacter jejuni infection) [9] . for this nr not reported reason, gbs can be defined as para-infectious neurological disease [4] . sars-cov-2 nervous tissue damage can be both related to the direct neuroinvasive action (through direct binding with ace-2 receptors) [24] and to an indirect injury of the immune system. in the latter case, the mechanism of immunemediated damage can be due both to an overactivation of the immune system with hyperproduction of interleukin-6, and to the generation of an autoimmune reaction [18] . the infectious bacterial agents classically associated with gbs are campylobacter jejuni, which is the most frequent, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae; cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, and influenza-a virus are the most involved viral pathogens [9] . cases associated with hepatitis e virus infection and measle infection have also rarely been found [25, 26] . in 2015 and 2016, cases of gbs related to the zika virus were also reported [10, 27] . in addition, recent evidence reported some cases of gbs in covid-19 patients, to the point of speculating a possible association between the acute polyradiculopathy and sars-cov-2 infection [10-23, 28, 29] .post-infectious refers to patients with gbs arisen once the sars-cov-2 infection has resolved, while para-infectious if gbs occurred during covid-19 [14] . in our case, the respiratory clinic slightly preceded the appearance of neurological symptoms, while the pulmonary, laboratory and radiological positivity to sars-cov-2 accompanied the whole clinical course of gbs, to have an almost parallel resolution. these data are suggestive for a para-infectious mechanism.as well described in the literature, gbs is an immunemediated disorder due to a molecular mimicry mechanism [9] . however, a real verification of the production of specific antibodies against gangliosides present on the surface of the nerve myelin sheaths is still lacking [12] . for this reason, further studies are needed to better clarify the pathophysiological mechanism of gbs in patients with covid-19.the diagnosis of sars-cov-2-related gbs in our patient was supported by a series of laboratory findings associated with the incipient clinic and electrophysiological data. in particular, the serologies of the most common pathogens associated with gbs, such as campylobacter jejuni, mycoplasma pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, influenza virus a and b, and human immunodeficiency virus, were negative. antibody tests for gbs-associated autoimmune diseases (e.g., ana, anti-dna, c-anca, p-anca) were also negative. furthermore, in support of gbs diagnosis, we observed a marked albuminocytologic dissociation. however, we cannot prove with certainty that a covid-19 para-infectious aidp subtype of gbs has occurred, as the sensitivity rt-pcr test of the oropharyngeal swab is suboptimal [14] . furthermore, some rarer but endemic northern italy infectious agents that can be related to para-infectious gbs, such as west nile virus and toscana virus, have not rv reference value been tested [14] . besides, adequate paraneoplastic screening was not performed, and antiganglioside antibodies were not studied. despite this, based on the anamnestic, laboratory, neurophysiological, and clinical data collected, we can support the correlation between the onset of gbs and covid-19, in line with emerged data of the literature review.while it is well known that sars-cov-2 correlates with respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, systemic and neurological involvement is still being studied. the case we described of gbs in a covid-19 patient adds to those already reported in the literature, in support of sars-cov-2 triggering of gbs.the aim of this work is to shed more light on the neurological manifestations of covid-19, not as a corollary of classic respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, but as sars-cov-2-related standalone clinical entities. to date, it is essential for all specialists, clinicians, and surgeons, to direct attention towards the study of this virus, in order to clarify the spectrum of its neurological manifestations.acknowledgements open access funding provided by università degli studi dell'insubria within the crui-care agreement.conflict of interest the

syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). it has spread rapidly throughout the globe, causing 3.8 million infections and 260 thousand of deaths by early may 2020 [1, 2] . sars-cov-2 is an enveloped rna virus that belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae, which includes well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) as well as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) [3] . the advancement in the management of these coronaviruses and other viruses like influenza virus h1n1 and ebola infections have provided insight into treating covid-19. more than 300 active clinical trials for covid-19 are being performed [4, 5] .chloroquine [6, 7] and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine [8] , lopinavir/ritonavir [9] [10] [11] , and remdesivir [7, 12] , developed for treating malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and ebola virus, respectively, have provided some benefits to treat covid-19 and are being tested in ongoing trials.although covid-19 is less fatal than the sars and mers, older patients with comorbidities tend to experience more severe symptoms, making them more vulnerable. the majority of sars-cov-2 infected patients displayed mild symptoms and generally have a good prognosis, classified as mild covid-19 [9, 13] . however, a large proportion of patients, especially among older men with underlying chronic diseases, have rapidly progressed to severe covid-19 and suffered from respiratory distress requiring emergent medical interventions [14] . unfortunately, there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials supporting vaccines or efficient treatment for covid-19 [4, 5] .additionally, recent studies have shown the important roles of host immune responses in protection and the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, for instance, sars-cov, mers-cov, and influenza a viruses [15, 16] . liao et al. [17] reported that increased immune cell recruitment in covid-19 patients suggested a crucial role of cd8 + t cells in successful viral control, and proposed support therapeutic strategies that target the myeloid cell compartment to treat covid-19-associated inflammation. however, little is known about drug screens of disease-relevant cell types.drug repurposing is an essential and universal strategy in the development of new drugs [18] . it may facilitate the discovery of new mechanisms of action for existing drugs, which is less time-consuming and cost-effective let alone the existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution [19, 20] . considering that an rna virus exhibits a considerable degree of sequence variation, drugs targeting host factors may cause less mutational resistance with more effective and broad anti-virus spectrum potential. hence, there is an urgent need to identify potential therapeutics with new strategies for emerging infectious diseases, and repurposing clinically assessed drugs represents one of the most practicable strategies for the rapid identification of treatments to combat covid-19.in this study, we analyzed a publicly available single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) dataset of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) collected from mild and severe cases as well as bulk rna-seq of balf in covid-19 patients from different experiments ( figure 1 ). data mining was performed by using the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (lincs) [21] , a drug perturbation database, to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease. a total of 281 candidates of different courses of covid-19 independent of cell subtypes were identified, 10 of which were in clinical trials of covid-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir [22] , dexamethasone, niclosamide, lenalidomide, hydrocortisone, metformin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, and verapamil. subsequently, we utilized the side effect prediction based on l1000 (sep-l1000) project to predict adverse drug reactions (adrs) and constructed drug-adr association [23, 24] .our findings may aid in the rapid preclinical and clinical evaluation of these therapeutics and can provide an important drug discovery pipeline to accelerate and facilitate the development of potential treatments for covid-19.the gene-barcode matrix files of all 6 donors containing 3 mild cases and 3 severe cases (lung balf) and 3 healthy control (lung tissues) were downloaded from the ncbi gene expression omnibus database (accession id: gse145926) [17] . all expression matrices were loaded in r statistical analysis platform using seurat v3 [25] and keeping cells with gene number between 200 and 6000, unique molecular identifier (umi) count above 1000 and mitochondrial gene percentage below 0.1. a total of 43,914 cells collected from three healthy subjects, three mild covid-19 patients, and three severe covid-19 patients, were used for the analyses. we also collected a list of differentially expressed genes (degs) in sars-cov-2-infected lung balf using a bulk rna-seq analysis to compare against the single-cell-based data. this deg list was obtained from the chinese national genomics data center (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/; accession id: cra002390) [26] .the lognormalize method in seurat was used for normalizing filtered gene-barcode matrix.principal component analysis (pca) was done by using the top 2,000 most variable genes. then uniform manifold approximation and projection (umap) was performed on the top 50 principal components for visualizing the cells, and graph-based clustering was performed on the pcareduced data with seurat v3 [27] .mast in seurat v3 was used to perform differential analysis. degs were identified by comparing each cluster between all of the three groups. genes with average log2fc > 0.25 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 were deemed as degs.degs were first sorted by the log2fc values and then the upregulated and downregulated genes were chosen to identify drugs and compounds against the lincs database using the connectivity map linked user environment (clue) platform [21] . the drug connectivity score (cs) with a negative value smaller than -90 was used to determine candidate drugs and compounds. covid-19 database from the international clinical trials registry platform (ictrp) (https://www.who.int/ictrp/en/, updated on may 5 th , 2020) was searched for clinical trials information associated with these drugs.both on-label and off-label adverse drug reactions (adrs) of the candidate drugs were collected from the sep-l1000 database (https://maayanlab.net/sep-l1000/). the sep-l1000 data include on-label adrs of fda-approved drugs collected from sider [28] and off-label adrs from the pharmgkb database [29] based on the post-marketing adr reports in the fda adverse event report system (faers).our study highlighted the identification of different therapeutic effects in the varied disease course. with the high variability of the cellular compartments underlying disease progression, our drug repurposing profiles from major cell subtypes included t, b, and nk cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells. a total of 9 scrna-seq balf samples, including 3 healthy cases, 3 mild cases, and 3 severe cases, were collected from publicly available scrna-seq data (supplemental table s1 ). after quality filtering, approximately 250,000 gene expression values from 44,000 cells were collected. the clustering analysis identified six major clusters of macrophage, nk figure s1 ), which was determined based on the unique signature genes cd68 (macrophage cell), il7r and cd4 (cd4+ t cell), cd8a (cd8+ t cell), ms4a1 (b cells), tppp3 (epithelial cells), respectively (supplemental figure s2 ). we then compared these six major clusters across the healthy, mild, and severe covid-19 cases and identified differentially expressed genes between any of the two courses (supplemental tables s2-s4 ).connecting to the lincs database of small-molecule perturbations on gene expression, we identified candidate drugs and compounds that can reverse these upregulated and downregulated genes via the clue platform. the closer the cs is to -100, a score indicating a complete reversal, the higher chance identification of drug-adverse effect associations with upregulated or downregulated degs, in other words, drugs may show a better response to reverse expression of degs upregulated or downregulated in major cell subtypes in the balf. there were a total of 281 candidates selected out by clue with cs lower than -90 based on degs among all three comparisons between two courses (supplementary table s5 ). to enable prioritization of known drugs for preclinical and clinical evaluation for the therapy efficiency of sars-cov-2, a summary of the most among major cell subtypes during the patients' disease course and the publicly disclosed clinical trial phases are annotated in tables 1-3. supplementary table s5 provides the complete list of potential anti-coronavirus agents from the current analysis, focusing on the fda approved drugs and experimental agents that have been already tested in clinical trials.to select candidates for mild cases, drugs and compounds were ranked according to their css (supplementary table s6 ), 133 candidate drugs were identified compared to controls (mild vs healthy group), and 53 of them involved in more than one cell subtype ( (table 1) , including hiv protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir [22] combination (phase 4), glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (phase 3/4) [30] , dna replication inhibitor niclosamide (phase 2/3) and antineoplastic lenalidomide (phase 4).the tubulin inhibitor flubendazole, widely used in treating intestinal parasites, is a potent inducer of autophagy initiation and can decrease infection of dendritic cells with the hiv [31] .azacytidine could partially reverse the aberrant dna methylation, a phase i clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy has been conducted to assess its therapeutic effects in children with leukemia, and in combination with apr-246 for myelodysplastic syndrome is in phase 3 clinical trial [32] . the bcl inhibitor abt-737 exhibits potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities [33, 34] . lopinavir is widely used for the treatment of hiv, formulated in combination with ritonavir that can increase the half-life of lopinavir [9] [10] [11] .repurposing analysis in severe covid-19 patients 60 potent drugs were also selected in severe cases compared to controls (severe vs healthy group) according to their average cs between the replicates, and 25 of them involved in more than one cell subtype ( figure 2b , supplementary tables s8 & s9) . as listed in table 2 protein synthesis inhibitor brefeldin-a has used inhibit entry of some viruses, like human papillomavirus and polyomavirus [35] , and egress of others, such as herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses [36] . indirubin, an active ingredient of traditional chinese medicine (tcm) "danggui longui wan", has potent activity against myelocytic leukemia [37] and therapeutic potential on iav-infection [38] .a total of 111 candidate drugs were identified in severe cases compared to mild ones (severe vs mild group), 39 of them involved in more than one cell subtype ( figure 2c , supplementary tables s10 & s11). as listed in table 3 , nine drugs (those for which drugs selected out in three separate cell types or more), including fostamatinib (syk inhibitor), ver-155008 (hsp inhibitor), ku-0063794 (mtor inhibitor), pik-90 (pi3k inhibitor), linsitinib (igf-1 inhibitor), tak-715 (p38 mapk inhibitor), y-27632 (rho-associated kinase inhibitor), az-628 (raf inhibitor) and lestaurtinib (flt3 inhibitor). in this group, except lopinavir, we also following listed 4 drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of covid-19 in table 3 syk inhibitor fostamatinib produced clinically-meaningful responses for adult persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia in two parallel, phase 3 randomized trials [39] . hsp inhibitor ver-155008 regulates kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic replication and highlights the potential to be a novel antiviral agent [40] . flt3 inhibitor lestaurtinib obtained orphan drug approval from the fda for acute myeloid leukemia [41] and in a phase ii trial of advanced multiple myeloma and phase i trials of prostate cancer.as shown in figures 3a & 3b and supplemental table s5 , lopinavir was the only one identified in all three comparisons, and interestingly, ritonavir was common in two analyses. there were 23 additional common drugs, such as sb-216763, abt-737, jte-907, brefeldin-a, pkcbetainhibitor, indirubin, gw-441756, flubendazole, tyrphostin-ag-1478, memantine, calyculin, kinetin-riboside, ascorbyl-palmitate, on-01910, mirin, verrucarin-a, emetine, tpca-1, rhokinase-inhibitor-iii[rockout], pd-158780 and nvp-auy922. for example, the glycogen synthase kinase inhibitor sb-216763 acts as neuroprotectant [42] and prevents cardiac ischemia [43] .jte-907 is a cannabinoid receptor inverse agonist producing anti-inflammatory effects [44] .to further demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy, we have accomplished the identification of therapeutic drugs by transcriptional changes in balf of covid-19 patients with a bulk rna-seq data [26] . ten efficient candidates were identified using the same analysis pipeline, two of which, including glycogen synthase kinase inhibitor sb-216763 and ppar receptor antagonist gw-6471, were also included in the single-cell-based candidate lists (supplemental table s12 ).further investigations are necessary to characterize the adrs which are a central consideration during drug development [45] . therefore, we conducted a computational approach using the sep-l1000 database to predictive relationships between drugs and the emergence of adrs (supplemental tables s13 s14). figure 4 shows a heatmap of the top 50 drug-adr association for on-label ( figure 4a ) and off-label ( figure 4b ) adrs. these findings highlighted drug-adr associations and may lead to inform clinical decisions regarding treatments for covid-19.covid-19 has spread rapidly, and no proven vaccine or drug has yet been identified to treat it.generally speaking, there are several ways to control or prevent emerging coronavirus disease, including antivirals, small-molecule drugs, biologics, and vaccines [4, 5] . due to the lack of effective therapeutic agents and long development cycles of vaccines, it is, therefore, reasonable to consider repurposing existing drugs and compounds for covid-19.drug repurposing is a potentially important strategy for the discovery of existing medicines to tackle covid-19 [18] . gordon et al. [46] identified 332 high-confidence sars-cov-2human protein-protein interactions for drug repurposing. an additional study [47] tested the antiviral activity of 20 fda approved drugs against sars-cov-2 that previously shown to inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov. another research team [48] conducted a high-throughput analysis of the reframe library to identify 30 candidates existing drugs that prevent the covid-19 virus from replicating in mammalian cells. in a study [49] based on public data of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and the database lincs, several drugs were identified on covd-19 targets ace2.host immune responses are particularly important in the protection and pathogenesis of the respiratory viral infections like sars-cov, mers-cov, and influenza a viruses [15, 16] . liao et al. [17] observed that t and nk cells accumulated, epithelial cells decreased in covid-19 patients compared to controls, meanwhile, macrophages dysregulated and the cell compartments differed in mild and severe disease courses, more t and nk cells decreased in severe cases but cd8 + t cells increased in mild cases. however, drug screening of disease-relevant cell types is still unclear.here, we analyzed publicly available data of covid-19 patients and performed data mining by using the lincs l1000 database to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease and sep-l1000 database to predict side effects. our approach is different from previous methods for drug repurposing for coronavirus, since it does not merely rapidly identify likely effective therapeutic agents in preventing or treating covid-19, but tries to filter out specific medications during the patients' disease courses. furthermore, the data and transcriptome are derived from human samples from real patients, two independent sets of experiments. lastly, we explore the underlying risk factors associated with some side effects of the candidates. overall, our data will guide the future development of therapies for the different durations of covid-19 and other viral respiratory infections.this study has several limitations to note. first, the public scrna-seq data had a small number of clinical samples (n=9) without available patient information, which makes comparisons between studies difficult. with the fast pace and expected large number of published literature using other patient samples, our candidate lists may need to be revised. second, our findings may not apply to children because all the sequencing data were from adults. future work on large-scale data mining would help us in better identification of antiviral drugs.the pandemic of covid-19 represents the greatest global public health crisis in this generation.so far, no proven vaccines and therapies have been identified. based on the study, we thoroughly investigated potential candidates for the treatment in covid-19 progression and predicted some possible adverse effects. the findings can guide additional repurposing studies, tailored for different stages of disease progression.the authors declare that they have no competing interests.jh, ch, mw and kg designed the project, collected data, performed analysis, and prepared figures. kg and zw collected data, prepared figures, and wrote the manuscript. pg performed analysis and prepared tables. qp revised the manuscript.the work was partially supported by the national institutes of health (p20gm113123) pilot grant to j.h.all the codes and data are available at https://github.com/guokai8/covid19/ table 1 . a list of potential drugs for treating covid-19 based on lincs database and degs between mild and healthy samples in b, cd4 + t, cd8 + t, epithelial, nk cells, and macrophage. connectivity scores were calculated from the clue platform. asterisk (*) represents the clinical trial for its efficacy in covid-19 disease.

(2017) reported about a successful sanitation of a herd that for about 10 years had experienced severe calf diarrhea problems due to mixed c. parvum and giardia intestinalis infections. they emptied the calf stable, removed bedding and faecal matter, let the pens dry for several days and then washed them with boiling water, coated them with milk of lime, and exchanged all wooden boards dividing the pens. during the two-year period following the sanitation no calves died and no c. parvum oocysts or g. intestinalis cysts were found (matsuura et al., 2017) . this indicates that hydrated lime disinfection might be an effective control measure in cattle herds.the aim of this study was to investigate if disinfection of calf pens with hydrated lime would decrease contamination of c. parvum oocysts and improve calf health in herds with c. parvum associated diarrhea problems.four herds were recruited to this cohort study. inclusion criteria were that i) the herd had a prevailing calf diarrhea problem for at least two months, ii) more than 20% of the calves developed diarrhea before three weeks of age, and iii) c. parvum, but not rotavirus or coronavirus, had been detected in calves from the herd. furthermore, the herd should not use hydrated lime or other chemicals for disinfection of the calf pens, and the design of the calf facilities should allow arrangement of calf pens into a treatment and a control section. preferably, the calves should be housed individually until they reached four weeks, but at least until two weeks, of age. potential experimental herds were identified by field veterinarians at växa sverige, an advisory and ai service company with knowledge about calf health in dairy herds in the different regions of sweden. based on clinical findings and laboratory diagnostic results, the field veterinarians considered c. parvum to be the main cause of the diarrhea problem in these herds. only herds that fulfilled all requirements were included in the study. several herds had to be excluded because they already used hydrated lime, and few herds kept their calves in individual pens longer than one week. owners of potential experimental herds were interviewed by one of the authors (cs) about management and health of the pre-weaned calves using a predefined questionnaire. before it was finally decided if a herd could be included, faecal samples were collected from five calves under three weeks of age and analysed for presence of cryptosporidium spp., rotavirus and coronavirus. only herds in which cryptosporidium spp., but no rotavirus or coronavirus, was found were accepted.each of the four herds participated in the study over six to seven months and was visited by a project veterinarian every second month, i.e. four times, during this period. at the first visit the magnitude of the calf diarrhea problem and the feeding and cleaning routines were recorded. the veterinarian and the farmer together decided how the pens/huts used for newborn calves should be divided into experimental and control areas, and how the calves should be distributed between the pens. in herds one to three, cleaning routines meant that all pens/huts forming one row in the stable were cleaned at the same time. in these herds, three to nine consecutively born calves were therefore allocated to experimental and control pens/huts, respectively. in herd four, every other calf born was put in an experimental and a control pen, respectively. the farmers themselves decided which area was used as experimental and control. this was, as far as possible, kept unknown to the veterinarian. the farmers were instructed to clean all pens/huts according to their usual farm routine before a new calf was entered. in the experimental pens/huts a thin layer of hydrated lime should then be spread onto the walls and floor. the recommendation was to use no more than 40 g hydrated lime to coat both floor and walls of a 1.5m 2 pen. farmers were instructed to apply the lime while the surface was still damp after washing in order to allow the lime to attach to the walls. if the farm routine did not include cleaning using water, a small volume of water was to be sprinkled onto the walls and floor before the hydrated lime was applied. the lime was allowed to work for a minimum of 24 h and farmers were instructed to brush the walls before the pen/ hut was bedded and a new calf introduced. the control pens were to be left empty for at least 24 h after cleaning before a new calf was entered.ethics approval for this study was granted by the regional ethical review board in uppsala (reference number c159/14).for each calf born during the study period, farmers were requested to record the identity number, date of birth, breed, sex, date when the calf was separated from the dam and moved to an individual pen, whether it was kept in an experimental or control pen, and the date the calf was moved from the individual pen to a group pen. if a calf developed diarrhea they were requested to record the date when the diarrhea was first observed, the length of the disease period, if the diarrhea was accompanied by decreased general condition and/or decreased appetite, if the calf received any treatment, and if it was euthanised or died.at each of the four visits, the project veterinarian performed clinical examinations, scored the body condition and collected faecal samples. all calves up to four weeks of age were clinically examined. general condition was graded from 0 to 3 (0 = normal behavior, alert, gets up when approached, interested in the surroundings; 1 = depressed, must be stimulated to get up; 2 = gets up with help; 3 = unable to stand even with help). dehydration was graded from 0 to 2 (0 = none; 1 = mildly dehydrated; 2 = moderately to severely dehydrated). faecal consistency was graded from 0 to 3 (0 = sausage-like; 1 = porridgelike; 2 = gruel-like; 3= watery). as a measure of disease severity, body condition was scored on a 0.5 scale from 2 to 5 for all two to four and six to eight week old calves based on shape of the lower back (2 = pointed; 3 = rounded, 4 = flat; 5 = inverted). faecal samples were collected for analysis of cryptosporidium spp., rotavirus and coronavirus from up to five 5-21 day old calves in the experimental and control group, respectively. samples were taken directly from the rectum. at the first and fourth visits, blood samples were also collected from five 2-7 day old calves for analysis of serum protein as an estimate of the colostrum management in the herd.one gram of each faecal sample was cleaned and concentrated by a saturated sodium chloride flotation method and analysed for cryptosporidium oocysts by epifluorescence microscopy as described by (silverlås et al., 2009b) ). the entire wells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy, and oocysts enumerated at 200x magnification. an animal was considered cryptosporidium positive if at least one oocyst was detected in the microscope. the lower detection limit of this method is 50 oocysts per gram of faeces (opg).all cryptosporidium positive samples collected at the first and fourth visits were analysed further to determine species and c. parvum subtype. dna was extracted using the powerlyzer ® powersoil ® dna isolation kit (mo bio laboratories, cat no. 12855-s) according to the manufacturer's recommendations but with the following modifications: up to 2 ml of each cleaned sample was spun down at 13,000 rpm for three minutes in an eppendorf centrifuge and the pellet dissolved in 750 μl bead solution. the solution was transferred to the glass bead tube and 60 μl solution c1 was added. the tubes were briefly vortexed and incubated at 100°c in a thermal block for 10 min, followed by bead beating using a mp fast prep 24 bead beater set at 6.5 m/s for one minute. finally, the dna was eluted in 80 μl solution c6.a nested pcr protocol for partial amplification of a ∼850 bp fragment of the 18s rrna gene was set up using kapa2 g robust hotstart pcr kit (kapa biosystems, cat no kk5517). the reaction mixture for all reactions consisted of 5 μl kapa buffer a, 0.25 μl of a 20 mm nucleotide mixture, 1.25 μl of forward and reverse primer (10 μm stock), 0.1 μl of kapa 2 g polymerase and 2 μl template in a total volume of 25 μl. the reactions were run in a bio-rad s1000 thermal cycler. primers for the 18s amplification were as described in (santín et al., 2004) ). samples containing c. parvum were subtyped through partial amplification (∼800 bp) of the 60-kda glycoprotein (gp60) gene using the same pcr mixture as for 18s but with primers described in (alves et al., 2003) . 18s reaction conditions were 95°c for three minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95°c for 30 s, 61°c for 30 s and 72°c for 30 s, with a two minutes extension at 72°c after the last cycle. two μl were used as templates for the second reaction using the same reaction conditions, except that the annealing temperature was raised to 63°c. the gp60 annealing temperature was 52°c in the first pcr and 55°c in the second. achieved sequences were compared with sequences deposited in genbank using basic local alignment search tool (blast, ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi).analyses for rotavirus and coronavirus were performed at the diagnostic laboratory at the swedish national veterinary institute. up to five samples are pooled at the laboratory and then rotavirus is detected by antigen-elisa and coronavirus by pcr. for each sampling, faecal samples from the experimental group and the control group, respectively, were pooled before analyses. serum protein was analysed by refractometer.data were entered and edited in microsoft office excel 2010 spreadsheets (©2010 microsoft corporation). results presented in the text are original, not modeled, data. statistical analyses were performed with generalised linear mixed models using sas (version 9.4, sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa) with the binary variable of whether or not a calf was kept in a hydrated lime disinfected pen as the main predictor. 'herd' was included as a random variable in all models. 'sex' was initially included as a fixed variable but had a negligible effect and is therefore not presented in the final results. 'breed' and 'housing' (i.e. pen or hut) were excluded from the models as they were associated with 'herd'. results were considered significant when p ≤ 0.05.for farmer recorded data, the association between whether or not a calf was kept in a hydrated lime disinfected pen and the binary outcome variable 'presence of diarrhea' was investigated by using a generalised linear mixed model with a binomial distribution for the response, i.e. a logistic regression model. the continuous outcome variables 'age at diarrhea onset' and 'days with diarrhea' were investigated assuming a normal distribution for the error term. as the residuals for the analysis of 'days with diarrhea' did not follow a normal distribution, data were log-transformed before analysis. the assumption of normality and equal variances was checked by appropriate residual plots.a variable 'severity' was created by combining the farmers´records of presence of diarrhea and whether the diarrhea had been accompanied by decreased general condition and/or decreased appetite. the 'severity' variable had three categories; 1 = diarrhea, but general condition or appetite not affected, 2 = diarrhea and decreased general condition or decreased appetite, and 3 = diarrhea and decreased general condition and decreased appetite. therefore, a proportional odds model was used to model the probabilities to fall in any of these categories when the pen was hydrated lime disinfected or not.for veterinary recorded data, 'general condition' data were categorised into 0 (normal) and 1 (affected, including all records > 0), 'dehydration' into 0 (normal) and 1 (dehydrated, including all records > 0), and 'faecal consistency' into 0 (normal, including records 0 = sausage-like and 1 = porridge-like), and 1 (diarrhea, including records 2 = gruel-like and 3 = watery). these variables were investigated by logistic regression models. body condition score was investigated by general linear models (glm), i. e. assuming normally distributed errors.the variables 'oocyst concentration', i.e. opg, and 'oocyst level > 45,000 opg' were investigated by glm on log-transformed data and a logistic regression model, respectively. the second variable was created because it has been suggested that 45,000 opg might be a suitable cut off to distinguish clinical cryptosporidiosis and subclinical infection (operario et al., 2015) .differences between serum protein values in first and fourth visits and between herds, respectively, were tested in a two-way anova without random factors.information obtained by interviewing the owners of the four herds before the study started is presented in table 1 . the calves were usually kept with their dam for up to 24 h and then moved to individual pens or huts (two herds had pens, one had huts, and one had both pens and huts) where they were kept for two to four weeks until moved and mixed with other calves in group pens or huts. in all four herds the calf diarrhea problems had been ongoing for several years and the farmers estimated the morbidity among 0-60 day old calves to be 33-100% over the last six months. caretakers gave colostrum manually in all herds except in herd four in which some of the calves suckled their first colostrum.in total, 422 calves were born during the study period, of which 20 were excluded either because the farmers' records were not complete or because the pen had not been kept empty for 24 h before the calf was introduced. thus 402 calves were finally included in the study. of these, 196 and 206 were kept in hydrated lime disinfected pens and control pens, respectively.the farmers' recordings are presented in table 2 . overall, the farmers detected diarrhea in 214 (53%) of the calves, with similar proportions in experimental and control pens. the mean age when diarrhea was first seen was 8.3 days (range 1-23 days) and it lasted for 3.9 days on average (median 3 days).'age at diarrhea onset' was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in experimental pens than in control pens, 9.0 days and 7.6 days, respectively,. there was no significant difference between calves kept in experimental and control pens for the variables 'presence of diarrhea', 'days with diarrhea', or 'severity' (table 2; appendix table i) .veterinarians examined 156 calves, i.e. all calves that were up to four weeks old at the time of the visits. there was no significant difference in the veterinary registrations regarding either 'general appearance', 'dehydration', or 'faecal consistency' between calves kept in experimental pens or control pens (appendix table ii ).body condition was scored for 55 calves at two to four weeks of age and from 54 calves at six to eight weeks of age. mean scores for calves from experimental and control pens respectively were 3.0 (range: 2.0-4.0) and 2.9 (range: 2.0-4.0) at two to four weeks and 3.1 (range: 2.5-4.0) and 2.9 (range: 2.0-3.5) at six to eight weeks. the six to eight week old calves kept in experimental pens had a significantly higher body condition score (p = 0.0069) than calves in control pens, but the difference between the groups in the younger calves was not significant (appendix table iii ).faecal samples were collected from 95 calves. cryptosporidium positive samples were found at all samplings in all four herds. cryptosporidium spp. was detected in 79 (83%) samples and oocyst counts were 50-126 × 10 6 opg, with a median of 52,350 opg in the positive samples. there was no difference between experimental or control pens in either the variables 'oocyst concentration' or 'oocyst level > 45,000 opg' (table 3; appendix table iv) . when the cryptosporidium positive samples from the first and fourth samplings (n = 52) were analysed by molecular biology methods, the species could be determined in 49 samples. c. parvum was the dominant species, found in 45 samples. c. bovis was found in four samples. two different c. parvum subtypes were found; iiaa16g1r1b in three herds, and iiaa16g1r1b_variant in one herd (table 4 ). only one subtype was found in each herd.rotavirus was found in all the herds and in pools from both experimental and control calves. in total, 32 pools (8 from each herd) were analysed and rotavirus was found in 11 (34%) of them. coronavirus was not found in any pool. the mean serum protein value was 58.4 g/l (range 46-70 g/l), with no significant differences between the first and fourth visits (59.3 and 56.1, p = 0.244) or between herds (p = 0.290).in this study, performed in dairy herds with pervasive c. parvum-associated calf diarrhea problems, calves kept in the hydrated lime disinfected pens were older when diarrhea was first recorded and had a higher body condition score at six to eight weeks of age. no other significant differences between calves kept in the experimental and table 1 background information collected by interviewing four dairy herd owners before the herds were enrolled in a study on the effect of hydrated lime on cryptosporidiosis. table i ). 1 experimental = calves kept in individual pens that were cleaned, coated with hydrated lime and left empty for at least 24 h; control = calves kept in individual pens that were cleaned and left empty for at least 24 h. control pens were observed by farmers or veterinarians.in disinfected and control pens the mean age at diarrhea onset was 9.0 and 7.6 days, respectively. although the difference between the groups is small, it is clinically relevant and represents a significant improvement in herds with pervasive diarrhea problems. body condition score in calves is an easily accessible but rough estimate of body condition and was used as a measure of disease severity. the significantly higher body condition score in the calves in disinfected pens at 6-8 weeks of age indicates that the disease was less severe in these calves. that no difference was recorded at 2-3 weeks of age may be due to the fact that several calves got diarrhea at a late stage; the diarrhea onset varied from 1 and 23 days of age.c. parvum and rotavirus are the two predominate infectious causes of diarrhea in young calves in sweden, whereas coronavirus is found sporadically and e. coli f5+ is an uncommon pathogen (björkman et al., 2003; torsein et al., 2011) . all herds were suggested to the study by field veterinarians who had identified cryptosporidium spp. as the main pathogen associated with the diarrhea problems. when we sampled the four herds before including them in the study, we detected no rotavirus or coronavirus in any of them. all four herds did, however, show the presence of cryptosporidium spp. during the study, cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were found in a high proportion of the samples (83%) at all four sampling points for all the herds. rotavirus was also found, but only a one-third of the sample pools were positive. together, this suggest that c. parvum was the major pathogen, but that coinfection with rotavirus might have contributed to the diarrhea.lime has been shown to decrease the viability of oocysts of c. parvum (zintl et al., 2010) . however, we found no difference in oocyst shedding between calves kept in the experimental and control pens. this might be due to the study design, in which faecal samples were taken at veterinary visits scheduled every two months. this sampling schedule was therefore not optimised in relation to either diarrhea occurrence or potential oocyst excretion patterns. we also note that for practical reasons, the lime was mostly left to react for only 24 h, whereas the shortest time used by zintl et al. (2010) was 48 h. disinfection might have been more effective if the lime had been allowed to react for 48 h in the study pens.the infection dose of c. parvum is very low; 25 oocysts have been reported to induce clinical infections in neonatal calves (zambriski et al., 2013) . in problem herds we can suspect a particularly high infection load, which is a challenge to any disinfectants. furthermore, zintl et al. (2010) concluded that in order to avoid reinfection, disinfection would have to be repeated at times when the pens were unoccupied. in the present study, disinfection was repeated, and each pen was unoccupied when coated. however, the barns were not emptied and cleaned before the start of lime disinfection. lime disinfection was only added as a complement to the ordinary cleaning routines and was started during the housing season, when the infection load was already high. cleaning routines and the quality of the equipment in the calf barns varied among the experimental herds. for example, in one herd the pens were not cleaned with water between each calf, and in another herd the boards dividing the pens were worn and difficult to clean. it has been suggested that components in cattle faeces enhance the oocysts' resistance to environmental stress (robertson et al., 1992) , and remnants of faecal material might have impaired the effect of the lime. we could speculate that the disinfection might have been more effective if the barn had been vacated, thoroughly cleaned, and allowed to dry for several days before the start of lime disinfection, as described by matsuura et al. (2017) .lime has also been found to be effective in reducing rotavirus contamination (hansen et al., 2007) . in the present study, an inclusion criterion was that no rotavirus had been detected on the farm. however, the samplings taken during the course of the study revealed presence of this virus in all herds. the study design did not permit determination of the significance of this infection in the herds.the passive protection obtained by a high uptake of antibodies from maternal colostrum is essential to combating disease in young calves. total protein content in blood serum can be used to estimate colostrum uptake; concentrations below 55 g/l are considered to indicate failure of passive transfer (tyler et al., 1999) . in contrast, higher concentrations are associated with improved calf health (waldner and rosengren, 2009; furman-fratczak et al., 2011) . although the mean serum protein value was above 55 g/l at both serum samplings, all herds had individual calves with lower total protein values, and only 5 of 27 calves had igg values above 60 g/l, indicating suboptimal colostrum feeding that may have rendered the calves particularly susceptible to cryptosporidial infections.in agreement with a previous study on calves from swedish herds with ongoing cryptosporidium-associated calf diarrhea problems , c. parvum was the dominant species, and c. bovis was only found in a few samples. however, in swedish herds without diarrhea problems, c. bovis is the major species seen in young calves (silverlås et al., 2010; silverlås and blanco-penedo, 2013 ). the c. parvum subtype iiaa16g1r1b that was found in three of the herds is the most common subtype in sweden, both in cattle and in humans. it was, for example, the subtype involved in a recent outbreak among veterinary students in sweden (genbank: eu647728) (kinross et al., 2015) . the iiaa16g1r1b_variant is not as common and is slightly different from iiaa16g1r1b: the tcg repeat is in a different position in the repeat region. it was first seen in sweden in 2015 when it was identified in children who had fallen sick after visiting dairy herds at public events held on the occasion of letting the cows out on pasture for the first time in spring (anonymous, 2016) . the sequence is published (genbank: kt895368.1).disinfection of calf pens with slaked lime delayed the onset of table 3 presence of cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in faecal samples collected from 5 to 21 day old calves in four dairy herds participating in a study on the effect of hydrated lime on cryptosporidiosis. oocyst concentration 2 > 45,000 opg 2.0 × 10 5 (8.7 × 10 3 -5.0 × 10 6 ) 10 (63%)1.5 × 10 4 (200-3.0 × 10 4 ) 3 (23%) 9.0 × 10 4 (3.3 × 10 3 -1.2 × 10 6 ) 8 (62%) 6.5 × 10 5 (50-2.0 × 10 6 ) 10 (63%) 2.0 × 10 4 (1.5 × 10 3 -3.6 × 10 6 ) 5 (45%) 6.8 × 10 5 (3.0 × 10 5 -1.5 × 10 6 ) 8 (80%) 750 (0-4.5 × 10 3 ) 2 (22%)3.0 × 10 5 (1.8 × 10 3 -1.7 × 10 6 ) 4 (57%) 4.5 × 10 4 a (1.1 × 10 3 -1.6 × 10 6 ) 25 (51%) a 7.5 × 10 4 a (900-1.5 × 10 6 ) 25 (54%) a 1 experimental = calves kept in individual pens that were cleaned, coated with hydrated lime and left empty for at least 24 h;

ebihara et al., 2003] . it generally accounts for 5-15% of hospitalization for lower and upper acute respiratory infections in children and the clinical manifestations ranging from otitis media to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [kahn, 2006; feuillet et al., 2012] . adults infected by hmpv usually only present with flu-like symptoms [boivin et al., 2002; walsh et al., 2008] , but high morbidity is observed in the elderly and immunocompromised patients [larcher et al., 2005; kahn, 2006] .the viral rna of hmpv is approximately 13 kb in length, including eight genes that code for nine different proteins [van den hoogen et al., 2002; feuillet et al., 2012] . based on genetic differences, hmpv isolates are separated into two genotypes, a and b, with each genotype subdivided into two subtypes 1 and 2 [van den . subtype a2 is further divided in two genetic lineage a2a and a2b [huck et al., 2006 ]. hmpv has a seasonal distribution with peak incidence in winter and spring [kahn, 2006; mizuta et al., 2013] . its circulation may vary each season and different genotypes can circulate simultaneously in variable proportions [mackay et al., 2006; gaunt et al., 2009; pitoiset et al., 2010; li et al., 2012b] .most existing studies of hmpv infection were focused on hospitalized children [kahn, 2006; feuillet et al., 2012] . however, epidemiological survey of outpatients is of unique importance for a comprehensive understanding of the current circulation pattern and clinical burden and for developing control strategies. a national influenza surveillance system which tracks influenza-like illness (ili) was launched in china in 2001 [yang et al., 2009b] . clinical samples of ili patients are collected by sentinel hospitals every calendar week. in the present study, specimens from children with ili were utilized to explore the circulation and epidemiology of hmpv in wuhan, the largest city in central china which has a resident population over 10 million. real-time rt-pcr assay was employed to evaluate the prevalence of hmpv infection and phylogenetic characteristics of hmpv isolates were also investigated.the children's hospital of wuhan was selected to be the study site from july 2008 to december 2013 since it is the largest public paediatric centre in the city as well as a national influenza sentinel hospital. young ili patients presenting at the hospital clinic were diagnosed according to the following definition: the sudden onset of fever >38˚c, with cough or sore throat in absence of other diagnoses [world health organization, 1999] . ili-positive children were excluded if they: (1) were older than 15 years of age; (2) had fever for more than 3 days; and (3) had been treated with antiviral drugs.during the 5.5 year study period, a total of 3,883 patients were recruited. about 10-15 eligible subjects were enrolled per week based on random selection of physicians, except for the period between august 2009 and september 2010, when inclusion number was doubled for the reason of 2009 influenza pandemic. after verbal informed consent was obtained from parents or caretakers, throat swabs were collected from study participants in 2.5 ml viral transport medium and were delivered to wuhan centers for disease prevention and control for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory viruses. since the sentinel surveillance of ili cases is covered by chinese legislation (law on the prevention and control of infectious diseases, article 17) and no extra sample was obtained for the study, ethic committee approval was not required.nucleic acids were extracted from 1 ml of specimen using magna pure lc 2.0 (roche diagnostics, rotkreuz, switzerland) following the manufacturer's instructions. total nucleic acids were eluted in a final volume of 100 ml. hmpv was detected by realtime rt-pcr using 7900ht fast real-time pcr system (applied biosystems, foster city, ca), based on the following primer/probe set: nl-n-forward (5 0 -catataagcatgctatattaaaagagtctc-3 0 ), nl-n-reverse (5 0 -cctat -ttctgcagcatatttg-taatcag-3 0 ), and nl-n-probe (5 0 -fam-tgyaatga -tgagggtgtcactgcggttg-bhq1-3 0 ) [maertzdorf et al., 2004] . high-load patient samples were applied as positive controls in the study. these controls were determined by seeplex rv assay (seegene, seoul, korea), a multiplex rt-pcr assay for the detection of 12 respiratory viruses, and confirmed by dna sequencing. participants' specimens were also tested for multiple other respiratory viruses using real-time rt-pcr assays [peng et al., 2012] . pathogens been tested included respiratory syncytial virus a and b, influenza virus a and b, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3, human rhinovirus, human adenovirus, human coronavirus, and human bocavirus.for patient samples shown to be hmpv positive, rt-pcr was employed to amplify the viral gene segments for genotyping and phylogenetic analysis. a previously described set of primers targeting at a 506 bp fragment of fusion protein (f) gene was used [huck et al., 2006 ]. retro-transcription and amplification were performed using qiagen onestep rt-pcr kit (qiagen, germany) and the amplified fragments were purified and sequenced at sangon biotech co., ltd. (shanghai, china) using an abi 3730xl dna analyzer. the genbank accession numbers of partial f gene sequences obtained in the present study are kc350987-kc351181.obtained sequences were aligned with the reference sequences of 17 metapneumovirus strains (16 human and one avian strain, supplementary table s1) using clustalx2 [larkin et al., 2007] and alignments were edited manually with bioedit software. further phylogenetic analyses were performed on a 489-bp f gene segment (nt 574-1062). neighbor-joining (nj) tree of f gene was estimated using mega software (version 5.05) [tamura et al., 2011] , with tamura 3-parameter model of nucleotide substitution as it gave the lowest bic (bayesian information criterion) scores. gaps were treated by pairwise deletion and substitution rates were defined as uniform among sites but different among lineages. to confirm the robustness and reliability of the branching orders, 1,000 bootstraps were performed on the neighbor-joining tree. additional phylogenetic testing of the dataset was the maximum likelihood (ml) analysis performed by using iqpnni (important quartet puzzling and nearest neighbor interchange, version 3.3.2) [minh et al., 2005] . the hasegawa-kishino-yano (hky85) model was used for ml tree generation, while substitution rates and base frequencies were estimated from data by the software. the numbers of iterations were twice of the sequence number of dataset.evolutionary distances within and between different clades were calculated by using the mega 5.05. in addition, sequence identity within hmpv samples identified in this study and between samples and contemporary circulating strains all over the world were estimated. genomes of 23 hmpv strains collected after 2002 were obtained from niaid virus pathogen database and analysis resource (vipr) [pickett et al., 2012] and served as reference sequences of contemporary circulating strains (supplementary table s2 ). sequence homology percentages of nucleotide level and amino acid level were calculated by using megalign programme of lasergene package.data were analyzed using pasw statistics (version 18.0; spss, chicago, il). categorical variables were compared by the x 2 -test. for continuous variables, kruskal-wallis test were employed after determining the normality of their distributions by kolmogorov-smirnov test. a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.a total of 3,883 ili patients ranging from 1 month to 15 years old (median age 34 months, mean age 45 months) were enrolled in this study, of whom 53.1% were male and 46.9% were female (table i) . hmpv rna was detected in 4.40% (171/3883) of all patient specimens and in 7.37% (146/1981) of specimens that tested negative for other respiratory viruses.the whole detection rate of hmpv was lower than that of influenza virus (23.2%), rhinovirus (8.27%), parainfluenza virus (6.21%), respiratory syncytial virus (5.74%), and adenovirus (5.15%), but higher than that of human coronavirus (3.37%) and bocavirus (0.95%). co-infection was observed in 25 hmpv rna positive samples, among which three samples have been shown to be positive for three different respiratory viruses. pathogens most frequently coinfected with hmpv were influenza virus (nine cases) and rhinovirus (six cases).the hmpv rna positive patients included 99 males and 72 females, with a male: female ratio of 1.375:1 (x 2 ¼ 1.649, p ¼ 0.199, chi-square test). the age range of those patients was 6 months to 13 years (median age 28 months, mean age 32 months). over 90% of hmpv rna positive children were under 5 years old (x 2 ¼ 32.32, p < 0.001, chi-square test) and the highest prevalence rate occurred in the group aged 3 years old, which was 7.91% (45/569) (fig. 1a) .hmpv was detected in every season during the study period. as expected, the virus circulated predominantly in winter and spring, with 80.1% of the identified infections occurring between december and may (fig. 1b) . a biennial alternation between high and low incidence was observed during the study (fig. 1c ). hmpv presented a high-level activity in the first two epidemic seasons. phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the 489 bp amplicons of hmpv f gene (amino acid position: 192-354) of 145 samples identified in this study. the other 26 specimens were not subtyped because of the lack of sample, unsuccessful amplification or low quality of sequencing. as shown in the nj tree, all four subtypes of hmpv were detected and the clustering was supported by high bootstrap values (>85%) of major intersects (fig. 2) . genotype a included 62 specimens. except one belonged to phylogenetic analysis of partial f gene fragments of hmpv strains in wuhan. the tree was constructed using neighbor-joining algorithm with tamura 3-parameter method through mega 5.05. analyses were performed on a 489 bp f gene segment (nt 574-1062) and had involved 162 nucleotide sequences. hmpv strains from this study were identified by the place of origin (wh for wuhan), followed by sampling number started with two-digit year code (from 08 to 13). sixteen reference sequences representing various hmpv lineages were included in the analysis, as well as avian metapneumovirus c (ampv) as outgroup. bootstrap values greater than 80% were shown (1,000 replicates). scale bar is on the unit of average nucleotide substitutions per site. subtype a1, all the other 61 samples were classified as subtype a2, and further, lineage a2b. among genotype b, subtype b1 included 42 strains and b2 included 41 strains. notably, sequences of consecutive epidemic seasons were clustered in the clade of b1. also there were two clusters in b2 clade that each was comprised by multiple identical or closely related sequences of one epidemic season (2009-2010 and 2012-2013, respectively) . ml analysis revealed similar tree topology with the nj tree (data not shown).sample sequences identified in this study shared high homology with sequences of contemporary circulating strains from all over the world at both nucleotide level and amino acid level (table ii) . evolutionary distances within groups suggested b2 was more heterogeneous than other hmpv subtypes (nucleotide distance: 0.011, amino acid distance: 0.004) and the nucleotide distance between groups showed that clade b2 was slightly more distant from genotype a than clade b1 (0.163 vs. 0.158).except subtype a1 that only one case had been identified, all other hmpv subtypes were found to share similar population distribution: more male patients than female, and the majority of patients were under 3-year old. there was no significant difference among four subtypes in their gender (x 2 ¼ 5.320, p ¼ 0.504, chi-square test) and age distribution (x 2 ¼ 0.495, p ¼ 0.920, kruskal-wallis test).genotypes a and b circulated simultaneously during the observation except the last half year, when only subtype b2 was detected. changes in the predominant genotype occurred in 1-3 years' interval (table iii) to discover the epidemiological and molecular features of hmpv infection in wuhan, we screened 3,883 respiratory samples from ili outpatients under 16 years of age that were collected over a period of five and half consecutive years. hmpv was detected in 171 samples, giving a positive rate of 4.40%. similar frequencies have been reported among the germen paediatric outpatients with ili (3.99%) [reiche et al., 2014] and arti children in beijing, china (4.02%) [zhu et al., 2011] , whereas influenza surveillance system in northern greece has detected a higher incidence in ili outpatients during season 2005-2008 (12.8% in age group 0-5 years, 7.36% in age group 0-18 years) [gioula et al., 2010] .the present study was very much facilitated by the existing ili surveillance which continuously collects clinical samples from outpatients with respiratory issues. however, it also caused potential sampling bias, as fever is not a typical clinical manifestation of hmpv in children [reiche et al., 2014] . according to the surveillance definition of ili, only febrile patients were sampled, thereby increasing the likelihood of underestimating hmpv circulation.no gender preference was found in the study. interestingly, although hmpv infection in wuhan occurred more frequently in children under the age of five as expected, the highest prevalence was in children aged between 2 and 4 years, not in younger infants like many previous studies described [van den hoogen et al., 2001; williams et al., 2004; lambert et al., 2007; zhu et al., 2011] . one explanation is that the risk of exposure is higher among children between 2 and 4 because they are just entering kindergartens in this age. the observation might also be related to the higher virulence of hmpv in infants and young children [boivin et al., 2002] . the virus has been demonstrated to be second only to rsv as a cause of bronchiolitis in early childhood [kahn, 2006] , which leads to substantial proportion of hospitalization of younger patients. children above 2 years old, on the other hand, are more immunocompetent and are more likely to become outpatient rather than be hospitalized during a hmpv infection. the majority of hmpv positive cases were diagnosed at the end of winter and early spring, which is the typical epidemic season of this virus in temperate zone [kahn, 2006] . however, the seasonal distribution of hmpv in wuhan varied in different study years. three main epidemic peaks occurred first in the winter-spring season in year -2009 , then shifted to the springsummer season in year 2009-2010 (march to june), and finally back to the winter-spring season in year 2012-2013 (november to march). multiple researchers from europe and asia also observed similar biennial shifts between winter and spring seasonality of hmpv. a significantly higher prevalence was identified in summer peak in austria [aberle et al., 2010] , in winter peak in japan [mizuta et al., 2013] , but not in beijing [zhu et al., 2011] , or wuhan as shown in this study. besides, the incidence of hmpv was not even in each season through the study. two epidemic seasons with high viral activity were followed by two low activity epidemic seasons and again by a high activity epidemic season. the cause of different seasonality and yearly incidence is unclear. our data did not support the assumption that circulation of different genotypes resulted in the change of temporal distribution, since no correlation was found between a certain hmpv genetic subgroup with high prevalence. but the possibility cannot be ruled out that environmental factors and circulation of other respiratory pathogens (such as the pandemic of a/h1n1/ 2009) have affected the epidemical dynamics of hmpv.phylogenetic analysis of partial f gene revealed that different hmpv subgroups circulated simultaneously in most time of the study. only one genotype was predominant in each epidemic season and the dominance of a certain genotype lasted for one or three seasons. such replacement of prevailing genotype is believed to be a random escape from the adaptive immunity of population to the circulating genotype [williams et al., 2006; aberle et al., 2010; pitoiset et al., 2010; reiche et al., 2014] . interestingly, a group of researchers from chongqing, a city in southwest china, has studied the epidemiology of hmpv among hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections between july 2008 and march 2011, yet they observed quite different seasonal distribution and prevailing genotype from wuhan: subtype a2b was predominant during the whole period and peaked in march to may 2009 and november 2010 to february 2011 . considering the 800 km linear distance between chongqing and wuhan, the difference was likely to be a result of geographic isolation as well as the distinction of study subjects.in this study, only one sample in epidemic season 2012-2013 was identified as subtype a1. as a matter of fact, a number of studies have observed the absence of a1 in recent years [li et al., 2012a [li et al., , 2012b velez rueda et al., 2013; reiche et al., 2014] , indicating this subtype has been going through a global trough from 2006. the only exception was an italian study that reported the circulation of subtype a1 was predominant in season 2009-2010 [apostoli et al., 2012] . the analysis of sequence diversity showed that nucleotide distance within hmpv subtypes was 0.007-0.011 and the corresponding amino acid distance was 0.000-0.004. such low diversity might be explained by functional constraints on paramyxovirus fusion proteins that prevent progressive antigen drift [yang et al., 2009a] . it has been identified that a region between residue 260-300 on f1 subunit of fusion protein presents considerable variation [yang et al., 2009a] , but no amino acid substitution specific for wuhan strains was noticed in this study. there were multiple closely related or even identical sequences from the same epidemic seasons or two consecutive seasons in clades b1 and b2, implicating that hmpv infections due to highly similar viruses within one period, at least in genotype b [reiche et al., 2014] .among all detected hmpv positive samples, 14.6% were found to be co-infected by one or two other respiratory viruses. this portion of sample was not excluded during data analysis because previous study suggested no significant difference in clinical manifestation and severity between patients with a co-infection and those without [kahn, 2006] . the positive rate of hmpv was lower than those of several other common respiratory viruses among the ili children in wuhan, but given the population size represented by the study subjects, this moderate rate could mean a large number of respiratory infection cases and significant health burden.in summary, this is the first long-term study on hmpv infection among ili children in china. it shows that metapneumovirus is rather a rare cause of ili in wuhan. a higher detection rate in children aged between 2 and 4 years was observed, as well as the biennial rhythm of viral seasonality. phylogenetic analysis revealed that all subtypes of hmpv were circulated in wuhan, yet each genotype prevailed for 1-3 consecutive seasons. strains in wuhan were evolutionally conservative and multiple identical isolates were observed in one season. since only limited information about the virus's prevalence and lineage distribution in the outpatient, these data improve the understanding of the local hmpv circulation patterns and genetic diversity. however, further surveillance in adults, ili outpatient and inpatient, are required to find the missing part of puzzle.we are grateful to the members of clinic unit of the children's hospital of wuhan for their help in sample collecting and delivery.infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) is a highly contagious viral pathogen of chickens. it is a type 3 coronavirus and part of the family coronaviridae (cavanagh, 2001) . most ibvs infect the respiratory, urinary and reproductive tracts causing considerable production losses (dolz et al., 2008; jones, 2010; roussan et al., 2008; villarreal et al., 2007; worthington et al., 2008) . ibv infections can also be further aggravated by the presence of bacterial infections such as escherichia coli, mycoplasma gallisepticum, mycoplasma synoviae and ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (landman and feberwee, 2004; matthijs et al., 2003; naqi et al., 2001; van empel et al., 1996) .since the first description of ibv in 1931 (schalk and hawn, 1931) , a number of different ibv genotypes have been detected worldwide (jackwood, 2012) . virulent ibv genotypes (eg. 793/b, qx, is/ 1494/06, is/885/00, q1) that have a severe impact on chicken health and production have been reported in recent decades (gough et al, 1992; kahya et al., 2013; meir et al., 2004b; yu et al., 2001) . infections from different ibv genotypes present a challenge for poultry producers worldwide (dolz et al., 2008; jones, 2010; worthington et al., 2008) , and also for owners of backyard chicken flocks. the spike subunit 1 (s1) is highly variable in ibv and analysis of s1 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and sequencing has allowed for genotyping of ibv strains (kingham et al., 2000) .avian metapneumovirus (ampv) is an avian virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family (lee et al., 2007b) . it is capable of infecting the respiratory tract of birds, causing avian rhinotracheitis in turkeys (jones, 2010) and swollen head syndrome in chickens (georgiades et al., 2001) . furthermore, it also causes a drop in egg production and/or egg quality in both turkeys and chickens (banet-noach et al., 2005; hess et al., 2004) . the virus was first reported in south africa in the 1970s (buys et al., 1989) and has since spread to other continents (jones, 2010) . there are four distinct ampv subtypes; a, b, c and d (cook and cavanagh, 2002) . subtypes a and b are widespread throughout asia, europe, africa and south america (jones, 2010; kwon et al., 2010; owoade et al., 2008) . reports of infections by subtypes c and d are infrequent and to date, subtype c has been reported in france, korea and the us (alvarez et al., 2003; bayon-auboyer et al., 2000; lee et al., 2007a) , with d so far only detected in france (bayon-auboyer et al., 2000) .there is a particular paucity of information from oman, with almost no published studies of avian respiratory viruses for any species. this is despite oman's geographic location (between the horn of africa and southern asia), its importance as a site for migrating wild birds and the presence of large commercial poultry production farms. these farms produce the majority of the omani poultry requirements; however census data in 2004 reports there were around 25,000 backyard flocks bred for household consumption (anon, 2004) . due to the avian influenza contingency plan implemented between 2004 and 2012, this number has been reduced to nearly 10,000 flocks (rural women development department, personal communication, 2012) . maintaining a good health status of backyard flocks is crucial for both the flock owners and the owners of nearby commercial flocks (mcbride et al., 1991) . backyard poultry in oman are not vaccinated against ibv or ampv.this paper reports the first study on the prevalence of ibv genotypes and ampv subtypes within backyard poultry flocks in oman.oropharyngeal swabs were collected from a total of 243 backyard flocks (2317 birds) from 237 backyard farms within all regions and governorates of oman (fig. 1) , from june to september 2012. more than one flock was sampled if the farm had more than one species of bird. the samples were collected during a study on the prevalence of respiratory viruses, such as avian influenza (ai), newcastle disease (nd), ib and ampv. the number and location of sampled farms was determined based on the estimated prevalence of avian influenza (ai) and newcastle disease (nd) in oman backyard poultry. sampling criteria were calculated based on an estimated prevalence of ai of 30% and between-cluster variance of 0.7. the number of flocks to be sampled was stratified by region according to the number of poultry farms, total number of poultry, number of people and number of backyard poultry present in each region. a confidence level of 95% was utilised along with a twostage cluster sampling method (thrusfield, 1986) .the total backyard poultry population in oman was estimated by the ministry of agriculture and fisheries, department of rural women development to be approximately 10,000 poultry flocks (table 1 ) with a median size of 50 birds per flock. the vast majority of the sampled farms raised local village chickens; however turkeys, guinea fowl, duck and geese were also present.local veterinarians and animal health engineers from the ministry of agriculture and fisheries in each state aided with the selection of farms at different locations. inclusion criteria involved a minimum distance between two farms (>1 km) and <3 farms from each village. if only one flock was present at a farm, 10 healthy adult (>3 months) birds were selected randomly and sampled. if more than one species of bird was present in the farm, then two flocks would be randomly chosen and 10 birds sampled from each flock. if there were fewer than 10 birds within a chosen flock, then all were sampled.for detection of respiratory viruses, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from each flock and pooled into 1.5 ml distilled water in a sterile 5 ml plastic bijou container. all samples were kept cool in crushed ice within a thermal-box and brought to the nearby veterinary research centre. the bijou was vortexed and 100 μl was inoculated into the centre of a flinders technology associates (fta) card (sigma aldrich, dorset, uk) using a sterile pipette and tips. cards were left to dry for 1 hour at room temperature (22°c), away from direct light sources, then stored at 4°c in air-tight plastic bags. samples were transported to the university of liverpool, uk, for processing and analysis. data such as sampling date, farm location (village, state, and region), species of birds, flock size, species of sampled birds, housing conditions, and water sources were recorded for each farm. spatial coordinates of the location were recorded using gps (garmin gps map 62s, usa).one circle from each fta card was removed using sterile scissors and forceps and placed in a bijou containing 800-1000 μl of te buffer (10 mm tris-hcl, 0.1 mm edta, ph 8.0), vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min (abdelwhab et al., 2011) . the supernatant was then used to extract viral rna.rna extraction was performed using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit (qiagen ltd, hilden, germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and stored at −20°c until required.rt-pcr was performed on each of the 243 rna extracts using both primers and cycle conditions as previously published (cavanagh et al., 1999) . a 268 bp band corresponds to type a, whereas a 361 bp band is type b. positive isolates were typed by comparison of amplicon size to an ampv type b positive control. this pcr protocol has previously been shown to detect up to 10 1.56 and 10 1.51 cd50/ ml viral concentration of ampv type a and b respectively from fta cards and one log higher from toc medium (awad et al., 2014) . subtypes c and d were not examined in this study.all samples were subjected to rt-pcr to detect ibv positive flocks. primers and cycle conditions were as previously described (cavanagh et al., 1999) . the presence of a 380 bp amplicon (relating to the s1 gene) demonstrates that the sample is positive for ibv. the ibv m41 genotype was utilised as the positive control. it is possible to detect ibv up to 10 2.3 eid50/ml from fta cards (awad et al., 2012) .positive pcr reactions were purified using 0.15 μl exonuclease 1 (exo) and 0.99 μl of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (sap). the mixture was incubated at 37°c for 30 min and then a further 10 min at 80°c to remove any residual impurities. purified dna along with the forward primer sx3+ was sent for commercial sequencing (source bioscience ltd, nottingham, uk).sequences were initially analysed in chromaspro v1.7.3 (http://technelysium.com.au/) to confirm good quality read data. alignments were carried out in mega6 (tamura et al., 2013) using clustal w (thompson et al., 1994) . following alignment, blast searches were conducted to confirm isolate identification. obtained ibv sequences were compared against reference strains for s1 retrieved from genbank (national centre of biotechnology information). reference strains used throughout this study were uk/ 3/91 (z83977) maximum likelihood analysis was utilised to infer phylogeny of both isolate and reference sequences, with default settings and 1000 bootstrap re-sampling. blast was utilised for nucleotide and amino acid identity comparisons between representative isolates within identified clusters.from the total of 243 flocks sampled during the study, five tested ampv positive (2.06%). all five samples were from chickens and all were identified as ampv subtype b. the positive samples came from northern regions of oman; three from the ad dhahirah region (albrimi, ibri and dank), one from the ash sharqiyah region (snaw) and the fifth from the muscat governorate (qurayat). four of the infected flocks were located within the mainland, with a single flock from the coastal town of qurayat (fig. 1a) .from the 243 flocks assayed using rt-pcr, a total of 39 tested positive for ibv (16.05%) (fig. 1b) . of the 39 isolates sequenced, it was possible to determine the genotypes of 32 (82.05%) using blast (table 2) . a total of five genotypes were represented within the sample size. the majority of samples showed greatest homology to genotype 793/b (n = 26/39; 66.67%), with the remaining isolates relating closely to m41 (n = 2/39; 5.12%), d274 (n = 2/39; 5.12%), is/ 1494/06 (n = 1/39; 2.56%) and is/885/00 (n = 1/39; 2.56%). all 32 sequenced samples were submitted to genbank and assigned accession numbers (fig. 2) .the al wusta region demonstrated the highest flock prevalence rate (37.5%) followed by the dhofar governorate (28.5%). the 793/b-like genotype was identified from all regions and governorates, except the muscat governorate which remained the only region to have no ibv positive flocks. dhofar governorate was the only infected region to demonstrate a single genotype (793/b), while the other infected regions had a presence of ≥2 genotypes. all ibv infected flocks consisted of solely chickens, with the exception of one duck and one turkey flock.genotype 793/b was detected in the duck and turkey flocks from ad dakhliyah and al batinah regions respectively. the 793/b genotype was also detected within chicken flocks from these regions. table 1 the estimated total number of flocks in each region, the number of flocks sampled, the number and type of each poultry species sampled in the eight regions of oman. results from the maximum likelihood analysis demonstrate that the isolates formed five distinct clusters (fig. 2) , relating to genotypes of strains previously reported. representative isolates from each of the five clusters were chosen for comparison of nucleotide and amino acid similarities (table 3) .the majority of the 26 isolates clustering with uk/4/91 had between 96% and 100% nucleotide homology (resulting in 92-100% amino acid similarity). the is/885/00-like strain had a higher we present the first study to identify the circulating ibv genotypes and ampv subtypes in backyard flocks in oman. for this study, an epidemiologically representative number of samples were collected from different regions of oman and transferred to the university of liverpool on fta cards. the cards inactivate genomic material and allow for rna extraction once back in the laboratory, proving useful for analysing field isolates away from the point of sampling. the successful use of the cards for both ibv and ampv has been previously described (awad et al., 2014; moscoso et al., 2005) . using rt-pcr and direct amplicon sequencing, we identified the prevalence of both viruses within backyard flocks in relation to location and poultry species.thirty-nine flocks were identified as ibv positive, with an overall prevalence of 16.04%. this finding is lower than previously reported in production farms within neighbouring countries, for example 58.8% and 42.8% in jordan and iran respectively (roussan et al., 2009; seyfi abad shapouri et al., 2004) . however both studies sampled chickens within a higher density environment, which may have contributed to the higher prevalence rate compared with the backyard flocks.in this study, 793/b was the dominant ibv genotype infecting backyard flocks, with an overall prevalence of 66.67% in ibvpositive flocks. the presence of 793/b in commercial flocks has previously been reported in other middle east countries such as iran, jordan and israel (meir et al., 2004b; roussan et al., 2008; seyfi abad shapouri et al., 2004) . in the last few years, 793/b vaccines and strains closely-related to 793/b, have been detected in the omani commercial chicken (k. ganapathy, unpublished data, 2010) . the 793/b isolates detected within the backyard flocks formed a close phylogenetic cluster, indicating that potentially the same 793/b strain may be circulating between different omani backyard flocks and regions. oman-lewa-4-12 was distinct from other 793/b-type isolates, with only 92% identity with the vaccine strain, which shows that it could be a virulent 793/b virus circulating in this flock.the mass serotype was the first to be isolated in the 1930s (jackwood, 2012) and adopted for use in early ibv vaccines (jackwood, 2012; sjaak de wit et al., 2011) . strains belonging to the d274 serotype were first isolated in the netherlands (davelaar et al., 1984) and later developed as a vaccine. in the current study, we detected m41-like and d274-like infections within four chicken flocks at a low prevalence of 0.82% each. both genotypes have been previously reported in commercial flocks in the middle east (roussan et al., 2008; seyfi abad shapouri et al., 2004; sjaak de wit et al., 2011) , albeit at a much higher prevalence than witnessed during this study. despite no clinical disease being identified in the m41 or d274 positive birds, both viruses are known for their ability to cause disease in chickens (bourogaa et al., 2009; feng et al., 2012) .ibv genotypes is/1494/06 and is/885/00 were originally isolated in israel and are currently circulating in a number of middle east countries (kahya et al., 2013; meir et al., 2004a) . here, for the first time, we report the detection of these important middle east variant ibv in backyard flocks. even though a low prevalence was witnessed in this study, their importance cannot be ignored due to their ability to cause severe respiratory, reproductive and renal diseases (kahya et al., 2013) . these viruses pose a threat not only to backyard flocks but also to the commercial poultry industry in oman and possibly further afield in the region.it is of interest to note that ibv genotype 793/b was detected in a flock of muscovy ducks from the ad dakhliyah region and in a turkey flock in the al batinah region. this presence suggests that common circulating ibv genotypes (such as 793/b) could potentially establish an infection in both ducks and turkeys. using rt-pcr, ibv has previously been detected in apparently healthy ducks in china and nigeria (feng et al., 2012; semeka et al., 2013) . despite previous reports having identified a turkey coronavirus closely related to ibv (breslin et al., 1999; cavanagh et al., 2001) , to date there has been only one report of ibv infecting turkeys (semeka et al., 2013) . to our knowledge, this appears to be the first report of an ibv-like detection in both duck and turkey flocks in the middle east.all five ampv positive samples from this study were of subtype b and were isolated from five different states within four northern regions, highlighting the sporadic distribution pattern of ampv in the backyard flocks. although subtype a was not identified in this study, co-circulation of both subtypes a and b within commercial flocks in the middle east has been previously reported (banet-noach et al., 2005) . this appears to be the first detection of ampv within backyard flocks in oman. with its involvement in respiratory and reproductive disorders (georgiades et al., 2001; jones, 2010) , the circulation of this pathogen is likely to pose a threat to backyard and commercial poultry in oman. as subtype c has only previously been reported in france, korea and the us, and subtype d is table 3 nucleotide and amino acid similarity between representatives from each distinct cluster (n = 9) and closely related reference strains (n = 7) for partial s1 sequences. only present in france, neither subtypes were investigated during this study.our study demonstrates the complex epidemiology of both ibv and ampv in backyard flocks in oman. the reasons for the predominant detection of 793/b-like over other ibv genotypes and the presence of a single ampv subtype (subtype b) are unknown. further to this, the potential sources of these viruses in the sampled flocks are not known. the detection of 793/b in duck and turkey flocks highlights the possible role of these birds as potential mechanical or biological carriers. with the expanding commercial poultry industry and the increasing role of backyard poultry in oman, it is essential to improve our understanding on the epidemiology of ibv and ampv strains for better control of these pathogens.porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) is a single stranded rna virus of the arteriviridae family (meulenberg et al., 1994) . this virus is widespread and causes disease characterized by abortions and stillbirth, increased pre-weaning mortality and respiratory disorders in growing pigs. although prrsv alone is considered a primary pathogen, co-infections with bacterial and viral pathogens like porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2), swine influenza, porcine respiratory coronavirus, mycoplasma hyopneumoniae or streptococcus suis commonly occur and exacerbate clinical symptoms in growing pigs (dorr et al., 2007) . as a consequence, prrsv is one of the most significant causes of economic losses in the swine industry worldwide (neumann et al., 2005) .prrsv shows a high degree of genetic variation. two genotypes are recognized, represented by two prototypes: lelystad virus (european type or genotype i prrsv) and vr-2332 (american type or genotype ii prrsv) (wensvoort et al., 1991; collins et al., 1992) . the european type strains can be further divided into at least three subtypes: veterinary microbiology 163 (2013) 1-12 pan-european subtype 1 and eastern european subtypes 2 and 3 (stadejek et al., 2008) . between the european subtypes, differences have been described in virulence of strains. one eastern european subtype 3 strain, lena, was described to be more virulent than a subtype 1 strain, as determined by clinical manifestations in infected pigs under experimental conditions (karniychuk et al., 2010) . the mechanisms by which a prrsv strain exerts its virulence are unknown, but it has been suggested to be related to in vivo replication capacity, tissue distribution, or immunomodulatory properties (haynes et al., 1997; johnson et al., 2004; loving et al., 2008) .prrsv infects in vivo specific subsets of differentiated macrophages in lungs, lymphoid tissues and placenta . through interactions with these cells, the virus may influence the host immune response. in comparison to other viral infections such as porcine influenza virus or porcine coronavirus, an altered innate immune response was observed with lower levels of ifn type i after infection with some prrsv strains (van reeth et al., 1999) . the adaptive immune response is usually weak and delayed. although an abundant virus-specific antibody response is induced, this exhibits minimal virus neutralization activity (kimman et al., 2009) . the cellmediated immune response, as measured by prrsvspecific ifn-g secreting cells, is late compared to other pathogens (meier et al., 2003) . as a consequence, a previous infection with prrsv may not protect against a homologous re-infection.the induction of an insufficient adaptive immune response is also a feature of current modified live prrsv vaccines. none of the european genotype vaccines on the market, containing subtype 1 strains, can claim to provide full protection (murtaugh and genzow, 2011) . furthermore, the genetic diversity of prrsv is thought to influence the efficacy of vaccines (labarque et al., 2004) . in experimental studies, prrsv vaccines were often not efficacious against infection with heterologous strains (diaz et al., 2006; zuckermann et al., 2007; darwich et al., 2010) . to aid the development of more efficacious vaccines, an improved knowledge of the immune response against prrsv is necessary.until now, most studies investigating the immune response of pigs after infection with field strains of prrsv used american genotype strains (meier et al., 2003; johnson et al., 2004; klinge et al., 2009; wang et al., 2011) . only a limited number of studies have used european type strains for infection (diaz et al., 2005; gó mez-laguna et al., 2009) , and no information is available about immunological responses to the more virulent european subtype 3 strains. the aim of the present study was to characterize the immune response after infection with two european subtype 1 strains, belgium a and the prototype lelystad-ter huurne (lv) virus, and a virulent subtype 3 strain, lena. this subtype 3 strain had caused severe clinical signs and 40% mortality in a previous study (karniychuk et al., 2010) . we demonstrated between the strains significant differences in fever induction, viral load, ifn-g secreting cells, cytokine levels, blood cell populations and the humoral response to an unrelated secondary antigen.prrsv strain lena is a recent eastern european subtype 3 prrsv isolate and was used at the third passage on porcine alveolar macrophages (pam). lena was isolated from a belarusian farm with reproductive and respiratory failure (karniychuk et al., 2010) . strains belgium a and lv are european subtype 1 prrsv isolates. prrsv strain belgium a has also been described as strain 07v063 . this strain was isolated from a stillborn piglet, derived from a belgian farm during an outbreak of prrsv associated reproductive disorders (karniychuk et al., 2010) . this strain was used at the third passage on pam. prrsv strain lv-ter huurne was isolated during the 1991 epizootic from a clinical case of prrs in the netherlands (wensvoort et al., 1991) . this strain was used at the seventh passage on pam.sixty-four 5 week old male pigs, cross-breeds between the great yorkshire, large white type and dutch landrace, were obtained from a prrsv-free farm in the netherlands with a high health status. all pigs were confirmed negative for pcv2 by pcr one week prior to transport, since prrsv and pcv2 co-infection can increase the severity of disease and cause post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (grau-roma et al., 2011) . to harmonize the genetic background of pigs across experimental groups, four male pigs of each sixteen sows were selected, and evenly distributed between four groups. the four groups were housed in different rooms of an isolation unit. between rooms, clothing, footwear and gloves were changed and materials needed for sampling and rectal temperature monitoring were provided separately for each room. standard feed for finishing pigs was provided once a day, and the pigs had unlimited access to water.after one week of acclimatization, the pigs were inoculated intranasally with 1.5 ml containing 10 5 50% tissue culture infectious dose (tcid 50 ) of either prrsv european subtype 3 strain lena (group lena), prrsv european subtype 1 strain belgium a (group belgium a), prrsv european subtype 1 strain lv-ter huurne (group lv) or an equal volume of pbs (group control). to study the humoral immune competence of pigs after prrsv infection, four pigs per group were immunized intramuscularly in the neck, behind the ear, with 2 ml of adv-vaccine on days 7 and 21 post inoculation (p.i.). the inactivated adv vaccine, suvaxyn i-aujeszky, was kindly supplied by pfizer animal health. this vaccine contained an oil-in-water adjuvant. at days 3 and 7 p.i. four pigs per group were euthanized. all remaining pigs were euthanized at the termination of the experiment on day 35 p.i. the experiment was approved by the ethics committee for animal experiments of the central veterinary institute of wageningen ur.rectal temperature and clinical signs were recorded daily. fever was defined as body temperature higher than 40.5 8c for one day or 40 8c for two consecutive days. for quantitative assessment of the severity of disease, a list of eleven prrsv-relevant criteria was used (table 1) . for each criterion, a score was recorded as either normal (score 0), slightly altered (score 1), distinct clinical sign (score 2), or severe prrsv sign (score 3). these scores were added up to obtain a total score per pig per day.serum samples were collected at days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 26 and 33 p.i. to determine virus titers and antibody levels. these samples were stored directly at à70 8c until testing. whole blood samples of the non-adv immunized pigs that remained in the experiment until day 35 p.i. were collected in paxgene-rna tubes (becton, dickinson and company) at days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 33 p.i. in paxgene 1 rna tubes (preanalytix), cells are lysed and the rna is stabilized. samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then stored at à 70 8c until rna isolation. heparin stabilized blood samples were collected at days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 26 and 33 p.i. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) were isolated from these blood samples and used for ifn-g elispot assay and flow cytometry. isolation of pbmc was performed by density gradient centrifugation using 50 ml leucosep 1 tubes (greiner bio-one). in brief, the heparinized whole-blood samples were diluted with equal volumes of pbs, and 30 ml of the diluted blood was added to a leucosep 1 tube. the cell separation tubes were centrifuged at room temperature for 20 min at 1380 â g without braking. the cell suspension was collected, and remaining red blood cells were lysed with ack lysing buffer containing 0.15 m nh 4 cl, 10 mm khco 3 and 0.1 mm na 2 edta. the cells were then washed twice in pbs (centrifugation for 15 min at 640 â g) and resuspended in 1 ml pbs for counting with the z2 coulter counter (beckman coulter).samples collected in paxgene blood rna tubes were thawed for 2 h at room temperature. tubes were centrifuged at 2800 â g for 10 min at room temperature and the supernatant discarded. the pellet was washed twice in rnase-free water and the pellet was dissolved in 1 ml trizol 1 reagent (invitrogen) further extraction of rna was performed according to instructions of the manufacturer. the yield and purity of the rna was assessed using a nanodrop spectrophotometer (thermo fisher scientific). table 1 clinical score list (adapted from mittelholzer et al., 2000) . all the 11 categories were scored for each individual animal and summed resulting in a maximum score of 28. prrsv isolation from serum was performed on pam cells, obtained from 3 to 5 week old piglets from a prrsv-free herd in the netherlands. the cells were previously tested negative for pcv2 by pcr. the pam cells were cultured in 24well plates (greiner) at a concentration of 5 â 10 5 cells/well in 1 ml rpmi 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fbs, 100 iu/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (crpmi; all from gibco, invitrogen). to each well, a volume of 250 ml serum was inoculated and plates were incubated at 37 8c in a 5% co 2 humidified atmosphere. after 3 days, the monolayers were washed in 0.15 m nacl solution, dried and frozen. the monolayers were stained by immuno peroxidase monolayer assay (ipma) as described by van der linden et al. (2003) , using a 1:500 dilution of the monoclonal antibody sdow17-a (rural technologies) against the nucleocapsid protein of prrsv. virus positive serum samples taken at days 3, 7, 10, 21 and 33 p.i. from the four non-immunized pigs that remained in the experiment until day 35 p.i. were titrated. serum dilutions were made in four-fold after making five decimal dilutions. virus titers were calculated as tcid 50 using the spearman-kä rber method (finney, 1978) .viral rna concentrations in serum were analyzed by qrt-pcr using a standard curve. rna was isolated from 200 ml serum using the high pure viral rna kit (roche applied science) according the manufacturer's instructions. standard curves were constructed for each virus strain by extracting rna from five decimal dilutions of medium with known concentrations of infectious virus. after the rna isolation, the nucleic acids were stored at à70 8c until analysis in the qrt-pcr.a one-tube qrt-pcr was performed with the mx3005 (stratagene) instrument using the quantitect probe rt-pcr kit from qiagen. the reaction mixture (25 ml) contained 0.25 ml of kit-supplied enzyme, 12.5 ml of quantitect mix, 15 mm of each primer (fw: 5 0 -gat gac rtc cgg cay c-3 0 , rev: 5 0 -cag ttc ctg cgc ctt gat-3 0 ) and 10 mm of probe (5 0 -fam-tgc aat cga tcc aga cgg ctt-tamra-3 0 ) (frossard et al., 2012) . the rt-pcr was done for 30 min at 50 8c and 15 min at 95 8c. a two-step cycling protocol was used as follows: 94 8c for 20 s, and 55 8c for 45 s for 40 cycles. analysis was performed with the mxpro software. the viral rna concentration (tcid 50 equivalents per ml) of each individual sample was calculated using the standard curve.prrsv-specific antibodies in serum samples were tested with an antibody elisa (herdchek prrs x3, idexx laboratories), according to the manufacturer's instructions. a sample-to-positive (s/p) ratio of equal or greater than 0.4 was considered positive.to detect virus neutralizing antibodies against prrsv, serum samples from day 33 p.i. were heat-treated for 30 min at 56 8c and serial 2-fold dilutions (50 ml volumes) of the test serum were then made in crpmi. an equal volume of the homologous prrsv strains containing 10 2 tcid 50 in crpmi were added to each serum dilution and serum-virus mixtures were incubated at 37 8c for 60 min. finally, 2.5 â 10 5 pam cells were added to each well and plates were incubated for 3 days at 37 8c before ipma staining of virus positive cells as described above.adv-specific igg1 antibody responses were detected using an indirect elisa (kimman et al., 1992) . the titer of a sample was expressed as log 10 of the reciprocal of the highest dilution yielding an s/p ratio >0.4.the number of antigen-specific ifn-g-secreting cells per 2.5 â 10 5 pbmc was determined using a elispot assay according to the method described by the manufacturer of the used multiscreen hts -ip filter plates (millipore). briefly, the plates were pre-coated overnight with 10 mg/ml of anti-pig ifn-g mab (bd). pbmc (2.5 â 10 5 pbmc in 50 ml/ well) were plated in dmem glutamax tm medium supplemented with 4.5 g/l glucose, 25 mm hepes, 10% fbs, 100 iu/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 5 mm b-mercaptoethanol (all from gibco, invitrogen).pbmc were stimulated for 20-24 h in triplicate wells by addition of homologous prrsv at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.01. concanavalin a (20 mg/ml [sigma] ) was used in triplicate wells as a positive control, and culture medium in triplicate wells as negative control (all 50 ml/well). plates were incubated with 100 ml of anti-pig ifn-g biotinlabeled mab (bd) at a concentration of 0.17 mg/ml. the reaction was revealed by sequential incubation with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase enzyme conjugate (r&d systems) and bcip/nbt substrate solution (r&d systems). the number of specific ifn-g secreting cells, as determined using an immunospot1 s4 analyzer (cellular technology ltd.), were calculated as the average number of spots in the triplicate pbmc cultures stimulated with virus, minus the number of spots in triplicate pbmc cultures exposed to culture medium only. the data were expressed as the background corrected number of ifn-g-secreting cells per 2.5 â 10 5 pbmc.isolated pbmc were transferred to microtiter plates (1 â 10 6 cells in a volume of 100 ml per well) and centrifuged for 3 min at 350 â g. cells were triple stained with mabs directed to porcine swc1, cd172a and swc8 for identification of leukocyte populations or cd3, cd4 and cd8 for identification of t-cell subpopulations. the staining with primary antibodies was followed by a combination of percp, fitc and pe labeled secondary antibodies. primary antibodies used were: mouse antiporcine-cd3: clone ppt3, igg 1 (kirkham et al., 1996) ; mouse anti-porcine-cd4: clone 74-12-4, igg 2b (pescovitz et al., 1984) , mouse anti-porcine-cd8a: clone sl2 (11/295/ 33) igg 2a (jonjić and koszinowski, 1984) , mouse antiporcine-swc1a, recently identified as cd52 (leitner et al., 2012) clone k263.3d7, igg 1 (abd serotec), mouse antiporcine-cd172a: clone bl1h7, igg 2b (vmrd), mouse antiporcine-swc8: clone mil3, igm (abd serotec). secondary antibodies used were: rat anti-mouse igg 1 percp (bd), goat anti-mouse igg 2b fitc (southern biotech) and goat antimouse igg 2a pe (southern biotech) and goat anti-mouse igm pe (southern biotech).flow cytometry analyses were performed on a constant event number of 50,000 cells, acquired on a facscan flow cytometer using cellquest software (both bd biosciences). monocytes were identified as swc1 + cd172a + swc8 à , and b cells as swc1 à cd172a à swc8 high (summerfield et al., 2001) . the cytotoxic t cell sub-population was identified as cd3 + cd4 à cd8 high , naïve t helper cells as cd3 + cd4 + cd8 à (t helper cells), memory t helper cells as cd3 + cd4 + cd8 + nk cells as cd3 à cd4 à cd8 + cells, and gd t cells as cd3 + cd4 à cd8 à (nielsen et al., 2003; gerner et al., 2009) . although the majority of gd t cells are cd3 + cd4 à cd8 à , they can also exist as cd8 + cells (gerner et al., 2009) . we, therefore, refer to this cd3 + cd4 à cd8 à population as cd8 à gd t cells. the numbers of each cell population per ml blood were calculated using cell counts from edta stabilized blood samples with the medonic 1 ca620 cell counter (boule medical ab).the concentration of il-1b, il-10, il-12, ifna, ifn-g, and tnf-a mrna in rna extracted from peripheral blood samples was determined by qrt-pcr as described by wichgers schreur et al. (2011) with slight modifications. briefly, 200 ng of total rna was reverse transcribed using random primers and superscript iii (promega). an appropriate dilution of cdna was amplified in a pcr reaction mix (20 ml) containing 5 mm of forward and reverse primer (2.5 ml of each primer), and a concentration of 2â sybr green mix (applied biosystems). the following primers were used (5 0 -3 0 ): il-12: forward primer attgcatgcttttcctgctgtt, reverse primer gctgagttatgcacta-tgcacgtta; ifn-g forward primer gagcatggatgtgatcaagcaa, reverse primer cattcagtt-tcccagagctacca; 18s forward primer agagtctcgttcgttatcggaatt, reverse primer tgcatggccgttcttagttg. primer sequences of il-1b were obtained from wichgers schreur et al. (2011) , il-10 from chaung et al. (2010) , tnf-a from de greeff et al. (2010) , and ifn-a from durand et al. (2009) . serial dilutions of pgem-t easy plasmids containing the pcr fragment of interest were used as internal standards. c t values for the tested cytokines in each sample were expressed as cdna quantity (ng) using the internal standards. subsequently, the cytokine levels were normalized with the ng levels of the house keeping gene 18s rrna. the data were expressed as the fold induction compared to the control group.statistical analyses to compare flow cytometry data and adv serology between groups were performed at each sampling point using a one-way anova. this test was used because of the homogeneity of variances between groups. statistical analyses to compare the virus load, prrsv serology, ifn-g elispot and cytokine rna levels between groups were performed at each sampling point using a non-parametric kruskal-wallis test followed by mann-whitney u tests for multiple comparisons. statistical analysis to compare data between the adv-immunized and non-immunized pigs within each group were performed using a student's t-test. calculations were performed with spss 19 (spss inc.). differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.in general, there were no differences between the prrsvinfected animals that were adv-immunized or those nonimmunized for fever, clinical signs, viral rna load, prrsv antibody levels, ifn-g secreting cells or frequency of immune cells in blood. therefore, in the results section, no distinction was made for the described parameters between the immunized and non-immunized pigs.differences were observed in clinical signs and body temperature between the pigs infected with the lena strain and pigs infected with the belgium a or lv strain ( fig. 1a and b) . all lena-infected pigs showed fever between days 2 and 15 p.i, one belgium a-infected pig (40.1-40.4 8c) between days 0 and 3 p.i. and none of the lv-infected pigs (fig. 1a) . clinical signs were observed in lena-infected pigs between days 3 and 17 p.i. (fig. 1b) , with animals displaying reduced liveliness and appetite, an increased breathing frequency and coughing between days 3 and 17 p.i. in the belgium a-infected group, one pig developed a red coloration of the skin of the ears between days 14 and 16 p.i. but did not show fever or other clinical signs related to the prrsv infection. in the group of lvinfected pigs, one pig showed a clinical score of 6 at day 8 p.i. and was found dead the next day. post-mortem examination showed that the cause of death was an intra-abdominal testicular torsion with infarction, thus the mortality was not prrsv related and the clinical sign score of this pig on day 8 p.i. was removed from the analysis.virus isolation on pam cells was performed on serum from all inoculated pigs, and showed that infectious virus was detected in the serum of almost all prrsv inoculated pigs at day 3 p.i. (table 2 ). from day 21 p.i., 50% or less of the pigs infected with the belgium a and lv strain were still viraemic. this is in contrast to the lena-infected pigs, with 7/ 8 animals viraemic at day 26 p.i. at day 33 p.i. most pigs had cleared the infection from blood and only one lena-infected and one belgium a infected pig remained viraemic. from the four non-adv immunized pigs that remained in the experiment until day 33 p.i, the serum samples were also titrated. the virus titration assay showed that peak virus titers of the lena-infected pigs, 10 5.4 tcid 50 /ml, were higher than pigs infected with the belgium a or lv strain, 10 3.8 tcid 50 /ml and 10 4.0 tcid 50 /ml, respectively ( fig. 2a) . the qrt-pcr performed on serum from all inoculated animals revealed data comparable to the virus titrations, although the level of viral rna in serum of lv-infected pigs (10 2.4 tcid 50 /ml) was higher than in serum from belgium ainfected pigs (10 1.5 tcid 50 /ml) (fig. 2b) .antibodies against prrsv were detected in all infected groups from day 10 p.i. (fig. 3a) . no antibodies were detected in the control group. there were no significant differences in antibody levels between the strains. at day 33 p.i. no neutralizing antibodies were detected in any of the three infected groups (data not shown).the highest numbers of ifn-g secreting cells after homologous prrsv stimulation were observed in pigs infected with the belgium a strain (peaking at a mean of 162 ifn-g sc/2.5 â 10 5 pbmc) (fig. 3b) . the lowest numbers of ifn-g secreting cells were observed for control pigs and lena-infected pigs (maximum mean of 6 and 19 ifn-g sc/2.5 â 10 5 pbmc, respectively) and these groups were not significantly different. the pigs infected with the lv strain had a significantly higher number of ifn-g secreting cells than the control pigs at days 21 and 26 p.i. (mean of 6 ifn-g sc/2.5 â 10 5 pbmc at day 21 p.i., and 33 ifn-g sc/2.5 â 10 5 pbmc at day 26, compared to 1 ifn-g sc/2.5 â 10 5 pbmc at day 21 p.i, and 4 ifn-g sc/ 2.5 â 10 5 pbmc at day 26 p.i. for the control pigs).the effect of infection on the number of immune cells in blood was most pronounced in lena-infected pigs (fig. 4) . the number of t helper cells and cd8 à gd t cells were significantly lower in the lena-infected pigs than in the control pigs. this was also observed for the belgium ainfected pigs, although the level was not decreased to the same extent as in the lena-infected pigs. the memory t helper cell level was also lower in the lena-infected pigs compared to the control pigs, but was followed by an increase. this was also observed for the belgium a strain, but the effect was less pronounced. the lv-infected pigs did not show a decrease, but only an increase of memory t helper cell at the end of the experiment. the number of nk cells of all infected groups increased after inoculation. it was significantly higher than the control pigs for lvinfected pigs at days 10 and 33 p.i. and for belgium ainfected pigs at day 33 p.i. only the lv-infected pigs showed an increase in cytotoxic t cells at the end of the experiment, compared to the control pigs. initially, a significant decrease was observed in the number of b cells of all infected groups compared to the control pigs. then, the number of b cells increased to a significantly higher level for the lv and belgium a-infected pigs at the end of the experiment. all strains showed a significant increase in monocytes at day 21 p.i. compared to the control pigs.in general, significant inductions of cytokine mrna in blood cells were detected in the lena and belgium ainfected pigs within the first week after inoculation (fig. 5) . no significant induction in cytokine mrna levels was observed for the lv-infected pigs compared to the control pigs. a significant up regulation of il-12 mrna has been observed for the lena (7.6 fold) and belgium a strain (4 fold) at day 3 p.i. compared to the control. for ifn-a mrna (lena: 4.2 fold; belgium a: 4.0 fold), ifn-g (lena: 8.9 fold; belgium a: 9.2 fold), il-1b (lena: 6.7 fold; belgium a: 5.4 fold), and il-10 (lena: 13.0 fold; belgium a: 18.3 fold) an upregulation was observed at day 7 p.i. at day 7 p.i. there was also a significant increase of tnf-a mrna in blood of the lena-infected pigs (3.7 fold) compared to the control. interestingly, at the end of the trial at day 33 p.i., there was an increase in ifn-g mrna in the blood of belgium a (5.2 fold) and lv-infected pigs (4.7 fold), and not in blood of the lena-infected pigs.following adv immunization, antibodies were detected in serum from pigs infected with the belgium a or lv strain and control pigs from day 21 p.i. (fig. 6) . in serum from pigs infected with the lena strain, antibodies were detected one sampling point later, at day 26 p.i. at this time, antibody titers from pigs infected with the lena strain were significantly lower (0.3 log 10 ) than the other groups (control pigs: 2.4 log 10 ; pigs infected with: lv: 2.1 log 10 , belgium a: 1.8 log 10 ).in this study, the pathogenicity of and immune response to three european type prrsv strains were compared. infection with the subtype 3 strain lena resulted in clinical signs, in contrast to infection with the subtype 1 strains, which did not induce fever or clinical signs. in a previous study with this strain in 6-week-old conventional pigs, clinical signs were more severe than in the present study and 40% of the pigs died within 3 weeks post-inoculation (karniychuk et al., 2010) . the severity of clinical signs and death of the pigs in that study might have been due to secondary infections, since arcanobacterium pyogenes and s. suis were isolated from the lungs of two pigs. we used pigs from a farm with a specific-pathogenfree status and pigs were kept under animal biosafety level 3 conditions, which would prevent introductions of infectious agents. this could explain the different clinical outcome between the studies, although it cannot be excluded that differences in severity of clinical signs were caused by other factors such as differences in pig breed (lewis et al., 2007) .fever was only observed in pigs infected with the lena strain. these pigs had around 100 times higher virus loads during the peak of infection, and higher cytokine levels in blood, mainly tnf-a, compared to the other strains. a relationship between tnf-a production/response in blood and the pathogenicity of prrsv strains has been demonstrated before (liu et al., 2010) . it was described that the highly pathogenic american genotype prrsv strain hun4, which induces fever and clinical signs, induced higher levels of tnf-a in blood early in infection than its derivative strain hun4-f112 of lower virulence (liu et al., 2010) . the hun4 also replicated faster and to higher titers than the hun4-f112 strain. the higher virus replication most likely means more trigger of innate immune defences, more cytokine production and more inflammation, resulting in fever. the level of ifn-g secreting cells was used to measure the efficiency of the adaptive cellular immune response. the level of ifn-g secreting cells remained low for pigs infected with the lena strain, but for pigs infected with the ''a'' denotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between lena and belgium a-infected pigs; ''b'' between lena and lv-infected pigs; ''c'' between lena and control pigs; ''d'' between belgium a and lv-infected pigs; ''e'' between belgium a and control pigs; and ''f'' between lv and control pigs. belgium a (from day 14 p.i) or lv strain (from day 21 p.i.), an increase in ifn-g secreting cells was observed compared to the control pigs. this would indicate that the subtype 1 strains belgium a and lv induce a cellmediated immune response, in contrast to pigs infected with the lena strain. interestingly, the level of ifn-g secreting cells of the belgium a-infected pigs was high (maximum average of 647 ifn-g secreting cells/10 6 pbmc), compared to the lv strain (maximum average of 132 ifn-g secreting cells/10 6 pbmc). most studies with both european and american genotype strains showed levels lower than 100 ifn-g secreting cells/10 6 pbmc before day 33 p.i. (diaz et al., 2005; batista et al., 2004) . it is not clear why the level of ifn-g secreting cells of the belgium a-infected pigs was that high. besides a stronger induction of the ifn-g response in vivo, it is also possible that the belgium a strain has a stronger ability to stimulate cells in vitro in the elispot assay. this has been observed for other strains previously by díaz et al. (2012) . for all strains, virus could be isolated from day 3 p.i. and peaked between days 7 and 14 p.i., then decreased strongly after day 14 p.i. during the decrease of viremia, an increase of nk cells was observed, mainly for the belgium a and lv strain, which could be related to viral clearance. beside the role of nk cells in virus clearing, cytotoxic t cells might have been involved in the clearing at the end of the experiment. cytotoxic t cells were higher than in the control pigs for all infected groups at day 26 p.i., although only significantly higher for lv-infected pigs. this higher level of cytotoxic t cells coincided with a peak in ifn-g secreting cells. the increase observed in the cytotoxic t cell level could (partly) be related to clonal expansion of prrsv-specific t cells, although this increase could also be due to a homeostatic regulation of the infection and inflammation. a relationship between viral clearance and cytotoxic t cells has been previously observed in pigs infected with european and american genotype strains (lamontagne et al., 2003; gó mez-laguna et al., 2009 ). however, others failed to show that cd3 + cd8 high cells exert ctl activity toward lv-infected alveolar macrophages (costers et al., 2009) . further studies should determine whether the prrsv-specific cytotoxic t cell activity in vivo is involved in viral clearance. it has been described for prrsv that the polyclonal activation of b cells occurs mainly in lymphoid organs (lamontagne et al., 2001; diaz et al., 2005) . the mobilization of these cells to tissue may explain the decrease in frequency of b cells in blood of the infected pigs. the activation of b cells in the lymph nodes could have resulted in the production of prrsv-specific antibodies that were detected in blood from day 10 p.i. during the last week of the experiment at day 26 p.i., the level of b cells of the infected pigs was higher than the control pigs, at which point the level of prrsv-specific antibodies was also at a peak. a similar course of cd21+ b cell levels in blood has been observed previously (shi et al., 2008) . others, however, observed either an increase or a decrease in cd21+ cells for at least 4 weeks after infection with a european genotype strain (diaz et al., 2005; gó mez-laguna et al., 2009) . although in our study higher levels of b cells were observed in infected pigs than in the control pigs at the end of the experiment, this did not contribute to viral clearance by the production of neutralizing antibodies. the absence of neutralizing antibodies has been observed for infections with european genotype strains before (diaz et al., 2005) . however, others found neutralizing antibodies with the lelystad strain around week 3-4 p.i. . the difference in results can be attributed to differences in the virus neutralization test method. therefore, it cannot be ruled out that there were small amounts of neutralizing antibodies at day 33 p.i., but the level remained below the detection limit of the virus neutralization test used.after many viral infections, such as swine influenza or porcine coronavirus (van reeth et al., 1999) , a rapid production of type i ifn (ifn-a/b) by the innate immune response supresses initial viral replication and promotes the adaptive immune response (kimman et al., 2009) . for prrsv, it has been shown in vitro that the type i ifn response is suppressed (ait-ali et al., 2011) . there are, however, conflicting reports of prrsv inhibiting or inducing a type i ifn response in vivo (van reeth et al., 1999; gó mez-laguna et al., 2009 ). in the present study an increase in ifn-a mrna in blood was observed at day 7 p.i. for the lena and belgium a-infected pigs, in parallel with the viral load. no increased level of ifn-a mrna production was observed in the group of lv-infected pigs. this can be the result of differences between strains in ifna induction, as has been described to occur in in vitro studies with infection of porcine alveolar macrophages with different prrsv strains (lee et al., 2004) , or different infection/replication kinetics of this strain in combination with the short-lived nature of mrna in blood.pigs have large numbers of gd t cells circulating in blood. these cells have been described to play a role in both innate and adaptive immune responses to viral or bacterial infections (gerner et al., 2009) . gamma delta t cells can act as antigen presenting cells or induce cytotoxic responses. regulatory functions have been demonstrated in mice and humans (gerner et al., 2009) . after infection with prrsv, they can respond by proliferation and production of ifn-g (olin et al., 2005) . in the present study, the level of cd8 à gd t cells decreased to a significantly lower level than the control pigs for the lena and belgium a-infected pigs at the peak of viremia. this level returned to normal for the belgium a-infected pigs at day 21 p.i. a similar course as for the belgium a-infected pigs in the level of gd t cells has been observed after infection with an american genotype strain (shi et al., 2008) . however, for the lena-infected pigs, the level of cd8 à gd t cells remained low until the end of the experiment at day 33 p.i. because of the role of these cells in innate and adaptive responses, this could result in increased susceptibility or a decreased response to secondary infections, such as those observed for the lower response of lena-infected pigs to immunization with adv.there is a general concept that prrsv is an immunosuppressive agent. there are, however, contradicting results about the immunomodulating effect of prrsv (de bruin et al., 2000; murtaugh et al., 2002; suradhat et al., 2006; jung et al., 2009) . these contradicting results could, amongst other things, be caused by the differences in virus strains used. in the current study, adv immunization was used to study the effect of the prrsv strains on the humoral immune response to another antigen. it was shown that infection with lena influenced the development of an antibody response against adv. this was in contrast to infection with the lv or belgium a strains. the results with the lv strain were in agreement with the results of de bruin et al. (2000) , who also showed that there was no effect of the lv strain infection on the antibody development against adv. for more virulent strains like lena, it has been shown before that infection can suppress the immune system. infection with american genotype isolates that caused clinical signs resulted in classical swine fever virus vaccine failure or increased disease after a secondary infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus (suradhat et al., 2006; jung et al., 2009 ). in the present study, the mechanisms behind the delayed adv antibody response of pigs infected with the lena strain might be the lower level of t helper cells, cd8 à gd t cells and b cells in blood of these lena infected pigs before the first immunization at day 7 p.i., possibly resulting in a lower level of effector cells.the present study showed differences in the immune responses to three different european genotype prrsv strains. however, the general picture was similar to other european genotype strains: a late adaptive immune response with no detectable neutralizing antibodies, and especially for the lena strain, low levels of ifn-g secreting cells (diaz et al., 2005; gó mez-laguna et al., 2009) . the virulence of the strain seemed to be mostly affecting the cell populations and cytokine levels in blood. although several mechanisms behind the difference in virulence have been discussed, further studies on cell populations and cytokine production in tissues should provide more insight in the mechanisms behind immune modulation by different virus strains. this knowledge on immune modulation by prrsv should aid the development of intervention strategies such as improved vaccines or other therapeutic agents.influenza is one of the most common respiratory infectious diseases and is responsible for between 3 and 5 million cases of severe influenza illness each year [1] . the influenza viruses are members of the orthomyxoviridae family and contain a single-stranded rna genome that is distributed in eight separate segments. there are three types of influenza viruses a, b and c [2] that have different structural arrangements of internal nucleoprotein and matrix protein antigens. the segmented genome may be responsible for the development of pandemic strains, whereas mutations (aminoacid substitutions) may be responsible for the development of influenza epidemics [3] .influenza typically results in mild-to-moderate illness in healthy individuals. however, disease severity tends to increase in children, the elderly, and individuals with chronic medical conditions (pulmonary, cardiovascular, liver, renal, and neurological diseases or immunosuppression).children are more susceptible to infection [4] with annual incidence rates up to 30 % [5] . in particular, children under 5 years of age are more susceptible to contracting influenza since they are an immunologically naïve population [6] . moreover, they can also be considered the primary transmitters of influenza in the community [7, 8] and shed virus at higher viral titers and for a longer period than adults [9] . community based surveillance programs have found that the h3n2 subtype is detected more frequently in adults, while h1n1 and influenza b viruses are detected more often in children [10] .after the beginning of the 2009 h1n1 pandemic, the center for disease control (cdc) seasonal surveillance reports documented an increased prevalence of influenza a virus (flua) compared to influenza b virus (flub) during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 influenza seasons. in the 2012-2013 season flua and flub were detected in similar proportions. in europe, the flua epidemic was primarily caused by the h1n1 subtype, which outnumbered the h3n2 subtype by in ratio 2:1. the flub epidemic was driven by the b/yamagata lineage, which was more prevalent than the b/victoria lineage by a ratio of 5:1 [11] . although a large amount of data related to influenza surveillance activity is available [12] [13] [14] , there are few studies that compare differences in the clinical presentations of flua and b subtypes isolated in children from italy.since that in the seasons 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 the circulation of flub was decreasing, the objective of this study was to characterize the clinical features, demographic characteristics, admitting department, and length of stay in the hospital for children, affected by flua and flub, admitted to bambino gesù children's hospital and research institute during the 2012-2013 flu season, with the aim to establish if the remerging of flub was associated to a clinical worsening, in comparison with those due to flua.a retrospective study was conducted analyzing data collected from patients resulted positive for flu admitted to bambino gesù children's hospital and research institute from november 2012 to may 2013. research ethics approval was not necessary as retrospective study in our institution, and informed consent was not required as the data were analyzed anonymously. patients received care in several hospital departments, but the major departments that provided care were emergency, pediatrics, surgery, the intensive care unit (icu), and the impaired immune function unit (iifu). samples of throat and nasal swabs (44), nasopharyngeal aspirate (85), bronchoalveolar lavage (2) and sputum (2) were processed immediately or stored at −80°c for up to two days before testing. the results of testing for the infectious agent and clinical symptoms, underlying disease, c-reactive protein (crp), and the patient outcomes were recorded.viral dna and rna was extracted from 400 μl of specimen using the ez1 virus mini kit v. 2.0 on the ez1 advanced xl platform (qiagen, gmbh, hilden, germany) and eluted into 60 μl of elution buffer.reverse transcription was performed using applied biosystems (van allen way, carlsbad, california) reagents from 10 μl of extracted nucleic acids. each reaction contained 5 μl of 10x rt buffer, 11 μl of mgcl2 (25 mm), 2.5 μl of dntp mix (10 mm), 2.5 μl of random hexamer (50 mm), 1 μl of rnase inhibitor (20 u/ ml), 1.25 μl of reverse transcriptase (50 u/ml), and 16.75 μl of depc water. the thermal cycling parameters were: 25°c for 10 min, 42°c for 60 min, and 95°c for 5 min.a multiplex pcr panel able to identify flu a and b, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229e/nl63, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, coronavirus oc43, rhinovirus a/b, and respiratory syncytial a and b (rv12 ace detection 23 seegene, seoul, korea), using the dual priming oligonucleotide (dpo) system [15] , was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. an internal control included in the primer mixtures was used to assess any potential pcr inhibitory effects. all of the samples that tested positive for flua or flub were further characterized by genotyping analysis to identify the subtype. for flua subtyping was performed using a procedure used in our laboratory, instead for flub a homebrew procedure was set-up according to who recommendations [16] .each flua positive sample was typed using sanger sequencing analysis. the amplified products were purified using a purelink™ quick pcr purification kit (invitrogen by life technologies, löhne, germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. sequencing reactions were performed using the modified standard protocol for the big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit 3.1 (applied biosystems). briefly, each reaction contained 2 μl of big dye terminator, 2 μl of 5x big dye eluent, 1.6 μl of 1 μm flua primers (seegene, seoul, korea), 1-3.5 μl of purified amplified dna, and water in a final volume of 10 μl. after removing the dye terminator using dyeex 2.0 (qiagen), sequencing analysis was performed using an abi prism 3130xl genetic analyzer (applied biosystems). all of the original electropherograms were analyzed using genbank blast software (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi) to identify the flua subtype. identity scores ≥99 % were considered sufficient for correctly identifying the subtype.each flub positive sample was genetically characterized to discriminate between the b/yamagata/16/88 and b/ victoria/02/87 lineages. each pcr reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 μl and contained 10x pcr buffer (applied biosystems), 25 mm mgcl2, 10 mm deoxynucleoside triphosfate (dntp), 10 μm forward primer, 10 μm reverse primer, 5 μl of template cdna, and 250 units amplitaq gold polymerase. the primers used to identify the victoria lineage were: the bvf224 forward primer (acataccctcggcaag agtttc) and the bvr507 (tgctgttttgttgt tgtcgtttt1) reverse primer. the primers for the yamagata reaction were: the byf226 forward primer (acaccttctgcgaaagcttca) and the byr613 reverse primer (catagaggttcttcatttgggttt). these primers were chosen based on the recommendations of the who [16]. the amplified products were detected by gel electrophoresis using the flashgel system, and 2.2 % agarose gels (lonza, basel, switzerland). the expected product for the yamagata lineage was 388 bp and 284 bp for the victoria lineage.data analysis was conducted using the statistical package for the social sciences windows, version 15.0 software (spss, chicago, illinois, usa). the descriptive statistics consisted of the mean ± standard deviation for parameters with a gaussian distribution, which was confirmed using histograms and the kolgomorov-smirnov test. the median and range (min to max) are presented for frequencies and categorical variables with non-gaussian distributions. comparisons between the flua and flub groups were performed with the oneway anova for continuous parametric variables, the mann-whitney test for non-parametric variables, or the chi-square test or fisher's exact test (if cells <5) for categorical variables. a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. table 1 according to their demographic characteristics (gender, nationality and age), clinical symptoms, outcome, underlying conditions, unit of admission/hospitalization, and length of stay. among the patients who tested positive for flua, 33/62 were female and 29/62 male, while for the flub patients 25/71 were female and 46/71 male (p = 0.320). all patients involved were between 0 and 16 years old. the highest number of cases of flua/h1n1 was observed in children less than 1 year of age. the flub b/ yamagata/16/88 lineage was most prevalent in children ranging from 3 to 6 years old. infections with the less prevalent flua h3n2 and flub b/victoria/02/87 strains were homogeneously distributed across the different age groups (fig. 1 ). there were no significant differences by one-way anova analysis between the flua and flub patients in terms of age (p = 0.370), weight (p = 0.203), height (p = 0.203), and body mass index (p = 0.660).fever was the most common symptom in flu positive patients. in patients with flub a fever <38°c (range: 37-37.9°c) was significantly more frequent than flua (p = 0.019) and patients affected by flua had a significantly higher frequency of respiratory simptoms (p = 0.034) than patients with flub. apnea was equally distributed in flua and flub patients. no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of laryngitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, or pertussis. twenty five patients presented with neoplasia/hematological malignancies or a severe underlying disease, such as chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems, metabolic diseases, and neurological disorders, that were clustered in congenital and genetic disorders ( table 1 ). in patients suffering from underlying diseases, flua infection was more prevalent than flub (p = 0.044). the normal concentration of crp in healthy human serum ranges from 0 to 0.50 mg/dl. in the flu patients, the mean crp value was 1.71 ± 2.54 for flua patients and 1.14 ± 1.72 for flub patients. a value ≥ 0.50 was obtained in 45 % of flua cases and in 46 % of flub.information related to the department where patients were admitted is shown in table 1 . patients accessed the hospital through the emergency unit in 33.7 % of flua and 66.3 % of flub cases (p = 0.017). the median of length of stay was 5 days (range: 0-59) for flua and 3 days (range: 0-116) for flub. community acquired influenza infections were equally distributed between the flua and flub patients, while among nosocomial infections flub was responsible for 90.9 % versus 9.1 % of flua (p = 0.039).there were no significant differences observed in the frequency of co-infections between the different types of flu. among the 62 patients infected with flua, 18 (29.03 %) co-infections with other respiratory pathogens were detected, 13 of which were co-infections with respiratory viruses and 5 were with bacteria. in 71 patients infected with influenza b, 11 (15.5 %) co-infections were detected, 7 of which were co-infections with viruses and 4 were with bacteria. there were no co-infections detected in patients with the b/victoria/02/87 lineage. the respiratory pathogens responsible for the co-infections are listed in table 2 .the distribution of influenza cases during the 2012-2013 season is shown in fig. 2 . the peak incidence of positive cases was between the 5th and 11th week of 2013. the highest incidence occurred for flua and b in the 7th and 8th week, respectively, corresponding to the middle of february (fig. 3) . the first flua case was detected at the end of november 2012 and started circulating earlier than flub, which was first detected at the end of december 2012.in this study, a comparison of the clinical features presented in children admitted to our hospital resulted positive for flua and b infections was analyzed. bambino gesù children's hospital is a reference pediatric centre for the care and treatment of children coming from central and southern italy.flub was slightly more prevalent (53.38 %) than flua (46.62 %) in the study population. this is consistent with the 2012-2013 ecdc surveillance report that reported a similar proportion of seasonal flua and b in europe. however, flua peaked and declined slightly before flub and the highest infection frequency was evident during the "winter season". our data show a similar seasonal trend for flua and b; however, in contrast to the data reported by the ecdc, the circulation of flua ended later than flub. our results were consistent too with the prevalence of flua/h1n1 (34 %), flua/h3n2 (5 %), and flub (58 %) in italy during the 2012-2013 flu season reported to influnet, a sentinel surveillance system for influenza [17] . influnet also reported 3 % of flua cases that were not subtyped. however, these data reflect the whole population and our data are concerned with only pediatric patients.the results of laboratory testing and clinical findings were compared for flua and flub patients to investigate clinical differences between the groups. no consistent differences were observed in the clinical presentation of patients by subtype viral, according to results of studies about the clinical characteristics of patients positive for influenza a and b [18] . males seemed to be more susceptible to contracting flu compared to females and, specifically, flub. this is concordant with previous studies in which the greater humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of females to viral antigens was demonstrated to play an important role in determining the gender variability in viral infections and, in females, being beneficial against infectious diseases [19] . with regard to the age distribution, flua was more common in children less than 1 year old, where they can cause more severe infections, confirming previous studies [20, 21] , and flub was more common in school age children.moreover, length of stay in children with flua was significantly higher than those infected with flub, being the median 5 days (range: 0-59) for flua and 3 days (range: 0-116) for flub. specifically, this long hospital stay (59 and 116 days) was, for flua, in a patient with complications due to tracheostomy procedure, while for flub a nosocomial infection occurred in a oncoematological patient. this finding is unsual since that in a previuos study children with influenza b in comparison with those infected by a/h1n1 influenza virus had significantly higher hospitalization rates (p < 0.05) [20] . is possible to speculate that the longer hospitalization for flua patients be correlated to the major cases with fever >38°c and respiratory simptoms. no significant differences were observed in crp levels between flua and b patients and a similar frequency of patients with elevated crp was detected in both flua and b. fever was confirmed as a major influenza symptom [21, 22] . a similar number of flua and flub patients presented with a temperature ≥38°. however, flub patients were significantly more likely to have a fever <38°c than flua patients. in contrast, respiratory symptoms were mainly detected in flua patients (table 1) . pre-existing diseases condition the clinical expression of influenza resulting in a greater number of these children developing lower respiratory tract infection [23] . we found that flu patients with underlying malignancies such as lymphoma, leukemia, solid tumor, or tubulopathy, were more susceptible to flub infection, in agreement with data previously reported [24] . in contrast, patients with congenital diseases (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, neuromotor disorder, swyer james syndrome, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, laryngotracheal cleft, or immune deficiency) and genetic preexisting conditions (cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia, trisomy of chromosome 10, or niemann pick disease) were more susceptible to flua infection. this is probably related to flua patients younger than those with flub. in our study, 12/133 (9.02 %) of flu infections were hospital acquired with flub being the principal etiological agent responsible. patients that contracted nosocomial infections were mainly immunosuppressed and admitted through the iifu (8 cases flub), followed by the pediatrics (2 cases flub and 1 flua) and surgery (1 case flua) units. numerous examples of nosocomial flu outbreaks have been reported in long-term care facilities for the elderly. experimental evidences supports the fact that humans generate infectious particles in both respiratory droplets and aerosols and that their generation is enhanced during influenza illness [25] . moreover, children, who do not have or minimal immunity against influenza viruses, and immunocompromised individuals, who can shed virus for long periods of time at high titers, have already been pinpointed as good transmitters in comparison to healthy adults. however, it is unclear why flub, in comparison to flua, should cause a more severe infection in the group of immunosuppressed and moreover, in the population object of the study, the number of patients with malignancies is low and it is difficult to establish if the difference is really significant.in our study there were no significant differences between co-infections with viral or bacterial pathogens in flua and b patients. all of the co-infections investigated were in children with a mean age less than 5 years.one death was reported in a flua patient affected by quadriplegia and chronic respiratory failure. it is possible that flua could have been responsible for further impeding the patient's ability to breathe.there were some limitations in this study. being a retrospective study, it was not possible to collect more clinical data, as well as the information about the vaccination history of patients that tested positive for flua and b; in addition, this was a single-center study and only one year was analysed.our study was primarily focused on the clinical presentation of flua and flub infections to provide additional information concerning the clinical presentation of pediatric influenza. no outcomes due to other respiratory viruses were evaluated. further studies that describe how co infections with other viruses impact flu infections could be useful. to our knowledge, there is limited published data regarding the clinical differences between seasonal flua and b in pediatrics after the 2009 pandemics. the main findings from our study confirm that, although fever is a major component of influenza a and b presentation, respiratory symptoms were more severe and the length of the hospital stay was longer for flua patients than flub patients concluding that the increasing of flub in the season 2012-2013 was without any dramatic change in clinical manifestation. although some studies have reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting to be more common with flub infection [26] , this was not the case in this study. the different viral types and subtypes should be routinely identifed by diagnostic laboratory to best address clinicians to appropiate therapeutic measures.in summary, our results suggest that the clinical features correlated to different flu viruses and to the relevant subtypes should be taken into consideration by health authorities to implement prevention strategies with the aim to reduce the number of sick subjects, the prevalence of hospitalization, and the circulation of flu.respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection is the most important viral cause of severe respiratory tract infection in young children. 1 in the first year of life, 98% of children become infected with rsv, with frequent reinfections in their second and third years. 2, 3 the vast proportion of children with rsv are not hospitalized. the burden of rsv disease in the community is substantial, though molecular epidemiology of transmission is not wellcharacterized. [4] [5] [6] [7] in the united states, 41% of children attend childcare, 8 which is a known risk factor for severe rsv disease, and likely serves as an important route of transmission to other attendees and family members. 9, 10 the socioeconomic impact of illness associated with childcare attendance includes work days missed and parental stress. 11 a 16- year longitudinal study of childcare attendees in the 1980s using culture techniques showed that rsv was the most frequent viral etiology of respiratory illness. 2, 12 the molecular epidemiology of rsv transmission is characterized by sequencing the hypervariable region of the glycoprotein (g) coding region. 13 transmission of genetically identical virus as well as the presence of multiple distinct co-circulating strains have been described in nosocomial settings. 14, 15 no studies have been performed to characterize rsv disease burden in a community childcare setting using current molecular diagnostics despite its importance as a potential setting for public health interventions, such as vaccines and infection control measures.the goal of our study was to characterize the transmission and clinical impact of rsv in childcare. we hypothesized that the spread of unique viral strains within a childcare setting would be rapid. rapid transmission was defined as detection of an identical viral strain within a one-week period within the childcare facilities. we further hypothesized that rsv infections in childcare attendees would be associated with increased symptom duration as compared to infections with other respiratory viruses.children age 4 weeks-30 months attending full-time childcare on fort lewis army base, fort lewis, washington, usa were enrolled in a prospective cohort study from february 1, 2006 to april 30, 2008 , and from october 28, 2008 to june 30, 2009. 16,17 informed consent was obtained from caregivers. children were followed for the presence of respiratory symptoms, and the study nurse was alerted at symptom onset by childcare staff or caregivers. an illness episode was defined as at least 2 of 5 symptoms, including cough, rhinorrhea, fever, wheezing and nasal congestion. each child had a nasopharyngeal swab collected at symptom onset and weekly thereafter until symptom resolution. a daily symptom diary was completed by the caregiver for 10 days following symptom onset. from february 1, 2006 to may 1, 2006, nasopharyngeal samples were collected only with illness episodes. in children enrolled after may 1, 2006, a sample was also collected at time of enrollment regardless of symptom status.childcare centers designated as facilities x, y, and z were located several kilometers apart. children were enrolled from rooms where full-time care was provided, defined as >20 h/ week. these included 6 of 11 rooms in facility x, 7 of 11 rooms in facility y, and 2 of 11 rooms in facility z. infection control procedures were performed and documented according to a standard operating procedure, including daily bleach disinfection of all toys, routine hand washing after toileting and diaper changes and before and after meals, and surface decontamination with bleach. 18 irb approval was obtained from seattle children's hospital and madigan army medical center.nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 13 respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay, including rsv, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses a and b, parainfluenza virus 1-4, adenovirus, human coronavirus group 1 (229e, n6l 63) and group 2 (oc43 and hku1), rhinovirus, and human bocavirus. subtyping was performed for rsv-positive samples according to previously published protocols. 19, 20 rsv-positive samples were sequenced using a heminested pcr protocol targeting the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein coding region. 21 complementary dna (m-mlv reverse transcriptase, usb corp, cleveland, oh) was amplified with forward primer gab (5 -ycaytttgaagtgttcaactt-3 ; g gene, 504-524 nt) and reverse primer fv (5 -gttatgacactggtataccaacc-3 ; f gene, 186-163 nt). the amplification procedure included 2 min at 98 °c, 35 cycles of 98 °c for 30 s, 55 °c for 1 min, and 72 °c for 1 min, followed by 72 °c for 7 min. a hemi-nested pcr was then performed using m13-tagged forward primer gab and reverse primer f1ab (5 -caactccattgttatttgcc-3 ; f gene, 3-22 nt) and 2.5 l of pcr product with the same protocol as in step 1. five hundred base pair amplicons were gel-extracted (qiaquick gel extraction kit, qiagen, germany) and sequenced (applied biosystems 3730xl sequencer). pcr products from some samples were cloned (topo ta cloning kit, invitrogen, grand island, ny) prior to sequencing. rsv-positive community samples during the same respiratory seasons were sequenced to serve as controls.sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic data were analyzed using stata 10.1 (stata corp, college station, tx). generalized estimating equations (gees) to account for multiple illness episodes per child were used to compare symptom duration (using identity link) and health care visit frequency (using poisson link) in rsv-positive and rsv-negative illnesses and viral load, symptom duration, and positive sample duration in rsv illnesses with and without another respiratory virus detected. univariable gee (using linear link) was used to estimate the influence of clinical characteristics on rsv viral load. cumulative incidence curves were constructed to describe rsv spread within individual childcare rooms. rapid transmission was defined as the presence of an identical viral strain within the childcare facility within one week. 16, 22 nucleotide sequences corresponding to a 205 and 305 base pair region of the g glycoprotein coding region for subtypes a and b, corresponding to nucleotides 5373-5577 for subtype a (genbank gu591768.1) and nucleotides 5406-5565 for subtype b (genbank nc 001781.1). these were aligned using seaview 4.3. 23 phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using phyml 3.0 within divein. 24, 25 neighbor joining trees were drawn using figtree v1.3.1 using the maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstrap replicates. 26 a slatkin-maddison test of compartmentalization of clades was performed to evaluate for sequence diversity. 27 nucleotide sequences were submitted to genbank (jx398254-jx398285).overall, 255 children were enrolled in the study; 110 (49%) were male. the median age at enrollment was 9 months (range, 1-26 months); median weekly hours of childcare attendance was 40 (range, 20-60 h), median number of siblings was 1 (range, 0-5 siblings), and the median duration of follow up was 210 days (range, 12-811 days). in total, 138 (61%), 72 (32%), and 15 (7%) children were enrolled at facility x, y, and z, respectively. the median age at enrollment was 8, 12, and 5 months at facility x, y, z, respectively. gender and number of hours of childcare attendance did not differ by facility. overall, 523 illness episodes occurred in 181 (80%) children with 332 (63%) episodes in facility x, 175 (28%) in facility y, and 16 (3%) in facility z (fig. 1) . the median number of illness episodes per child was 3 (range, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . a respiratory virus was detected in 429 (82%) of 523 illnesses. asymptomatic enrollment samples were collected for 127 (56%) children, and 89 (70%) of these were positive for a respiratory virus, with the most common viruses detected being rhinovirus (n = 57; 45%), bocavirus (n = 26; 20%), and adenovirus (n = 18; 14%).rsv was detected in 59 (11%) of the 523 illness episodes, and 3 (2%) asymptomatic enrollment samples. of the 59 illness episodes, 35 (59%) occurred in children under one year. compared to the 464 rsv-negative episodes (table 1) , rsv-positive episodes were associated with more days of wheezing (p < 0.001), fever (p < 0.001), cough (p < 0.001), congestion (p = 0.003), and an increased percentage of visits to a health care provider (p < 0.001) and childcare (p < 0.001) and parental work days missed (p < 0.001). the median duration of symptoms was 10 days (range, 4-10 days). the median initial viral load was 7.5 log 10 copies/ml (range, 2.6-10.0). initial rsv viral load was not correlated with age at illness onset (r 2 = 0.03; p = 0.22; data not shown), duration of detection of rsv (r 2 < 0.01; p = 0.73; data not shown) or number of days of symptoms (r 2 = 0.01; p = 0.43; data not shown). there was no relationship between age at illness onset and number of days of symptoms (r 2 < 0.01; p = 0.86; data not shown).in 42 (71%) rsv-positive episodes, at least one other respiratory virus was detected. the most common were bocavirus (n = 28; 67%), rhinovirus (n = 18; 43%), adenovirus (n = 18; 43%), coronavirus (n = 5; 12%), and parainfluenza type 3 (n = 5; 12%). duration of symptoms was not significantly different between illness episodes with and without another respiratory virus, though numbers of childcare and work days missed were increased ( table  2 ). the rsv viral load was not significantly different between rsv-positive episodes with and without another respiratory virus identified (16.1 vs. 17.1 log 10 copies/ml; p = 0.38), though duration of detection of rsv (4.9 vs. 1.8 days; p < 0.001) was increased.three children had a second illness episode, with a median of 12 months [range, 1-13 months] between illnesss episodes and a median decline in viral load of 8.7 log 10 copies/ml [range, 8.2-9.0]. duration of symptoms was a median of 8 days [range, 5-10 days] for the first illness episode, and 7 days [range, 4-10 days] for the 2nd illness episode.rsv episodes occurred from november to april in the three successive winter seasons of the study. rsv subtype b predominated in season 1 with 21 (78%) of 27 episodes, while rsv subtype a predominated in seasons 2 and 3 with 7 (88%) of 8 episodes and 20 (74%) of 27 episodes, respectively [ fig. 2a and b (1, 8 , and 6 episodes in seasons 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were not included due to occurrence outside of the time interval illustrated)].we sequenced samples from 25 (42%) of 59 illness episodes as well as one nasopharyngeal sample collected from an asymptomatic child at enrollment. episodes that were sequenced were more likely to have higher viral loads (p < 0.001), but did not differ by date of collection (p = 0.71), implying that the inability to sequence a subset of samples was due to limited template rather than sample degradation. clusters of identical rsv strains were detected in childcare samples from the same seasons and within rooms, which were distinct from six community controls, eight reference sequences obtained from genbank, and viruses isolated during different time periods in the same childcare facilities. phylogenetic trees constructed for subtype a (fig. 3) and subtype b viruses (fig. 4) showed evidence of compartmentalized clades for subtype a (p < 0.001), but insufficient variation within subtype b strains to distinguish clades.we identified clusters of rsv episodes in rooms y11 (subtype b, season 1) and x3 (subtype a, season 3). during both clusters, 50% of enrolled children in each room were infected within six days of the first case (fig. 5) . in total, 8 of 12 children in y11 and 8 of 13 children in x3 developed rsv over a 16-day period. samples from two episodes 14 days apart in y11 contained the same rsv strain, as did 5 episodes in x3 that spanned the entire 16-day period. these results suggest that child-to-child transmission of one viral strain was likely responsible for these clusters of rsv illness. a third cluster of seven rsv episodes was identified in room x3 during season 1, consisting of two subtype a and five subtype b viruses. sequencing of the two subtype a episodes showed identical viral strains, while sequencing of three subtype b episodes showed two different viral strains, indicating that multiple viral strains co-circulated simultaneously in the childcare room (fig. 6 ).in season 1, we identified four subtype b episodes with identical strains in rooms y11 and x3 from november 13 to december 8. at the same time, three subtype a episodes with identical strains were identified in rooms x3 and y2. these two facilities were located several kilometers apart, making it less likely that direct inoculation from child-to-child was the mode of transmission. no rsv-positive sibling pairs enrolled in the study were located in different facilities. however, sibling pairs who were not enrolled in the study or parents, many of whom worked on fort lewis, may also have transmitted rsv. in season 3, eight subtype a episodes with identical strains were detected in facility x in rooms x3, x5, and x6 from november 18 to december 5, suggesting transmission both within and between rooms within facility x during season 3, with temporal and geographic clustering of two additional clusters of identical strains in december and march (fig. 6) .rsv was also detected in two sibling pairs, both in the same childcare room. in one sibling pair, rsv was detected simultaneously in both children. sequencing results from this pair showed identical viral strains in both children. in the other sibling pair, rsv was detected one week apart, though these samples were not sequenced.our study is the first to describe the molecular epidemiology of rsv transmission in childcare, a potential target of infection control interventions in the community. among childcare attendees in our study, rsv-positive illness episodes were associated with greater symptom duration, number of parental work and childcare days missed, and visits to health care providers than illness episodes without rsv detected. using molecular sequencing, we documented high rates of infection and transmission of identical rsv strains in childcare. within one week of the index case, we detected an identical viral strain in another child in the same facility. this same strain was detected in 7 additional children in the facility within a 16-day period.rsv viral load in hospitalized infants may predict duration of hospitalization and studies of experimentally rsv-infected adults show that peak viral load correlates with symptom score. 28, 29 we did not find a relationship between viral load and symptom duration. the criteria used to characterize disease severity in the inpatient setting may not be applicable to our outpatient population, or we may have captured both primary and secondary rsv cases, potentially impacting viral load.the significance of respiratory viral co-infection remains controversial. we found no relationship between co-infection and rsv viral load or symptom duration. four prior studies did not find increased rsv disease severity among hospitalized children when multiple viruses were detected. [30] [31] [32] [33] this is in contrast to a study showing that co-infection with rsv and human metapneumovirus was associated with increased disease severity compared to rsv alone, as measured by intensive care unit admission. 34 no children were co-infected with rsv and human metapneumovirus in our study.we documented simultaneous circulation of multiple rsv strains in an outbreak setting with predominance of one viral strain within a 16-day period among 9 childcare attendees in the same facility. we showed that within one week of the first case, another child had an identical strain detected, suggesting rapid child-to-child transmission within the facility. further, we demonstrated that once rsv was detected in a childcare room, over 50% of children in the room became infected within a week. while there was clustering of identical viral strains within rooms and facilities, we also found that several unique viral strains circulated in a room simultaneously during an outbreak. this is consistent with data from outbreaks in bone marrow transplant settings, 35,36 but has not been previously investigated in the childcare setting, an important source of community-acquired respiratory viral infections. viral transmission correlates directly with degree and intensity of hand or nasal inoculation with large droplets or fomites, 37, 38 activities which are likely to be frequent within childcare. although infection control measures including handwashing and sanitation of surfaces were utilized according to current guidelines in our facilities, [39] [40] [41] our results imply that rsv is readily transmitted in childcare facilities despite these routine measures.this study has some limitations. children may shed and transmit rsv after they become asymptomatic, and we did not perform regular sampling in asymptomatic participants. 42 although we captured ten days of symptom data, younger children may experience symptoms lasting longer. further, we were not able to use a preceding asymptomatic period as criteria for a new illness episode. many children enrolled in our childcare facilities were never symptom-free, particularly when considering cough and rhinorrhea. each new illness episode that was close in timing to a prior illness episode was reviewed by the study staff and a consensus decision was made to decide whether this should be classified as a new episode versus a continuation of a prior illness. in general, children who developed new symptoms, as opposed to worsening of previous symptoms, were classified as having a new illness episode. finally, we sequenced rsv from only 42% of episodes, though our ability to sequence viruses from clinical samples is consistent with other studies characterizing rsv transmission. 35 our study shows that the childcare setting is a significant source of rapid child-to-child rsv transmission, and that once acquired, rsv leads to significantly greater symptom duration than other respiratory viruses. these results highlight the significant clinical and socioeconomic impact of rsv in the community, and emphasize that the childcare setting is an important potential site of interventions to reduce the burden of rsv disease.interventions that reduce rsv transmission in childcare, such as vaccines and enhanced infection control measures, are likely to have a substantial clinical and socioeconomic impact. flow chart of illness episodes. epidemic curve of rsv spread within childcare rooms by subtype in season 1 (2a) and season 3 (2b) from november to january. the y-axis is the number of episodes. the x-axis represents time. each box represents one episode. the numbers and letters within each box represent the facility and room number of the child. one, eight,

detected in 3 seasons compared to community controls and genbank sequences. the samples are identified by date followed by location and patient identifier. genbank sequences are identified by year of sample followed by "ref." community controls are identified by the year of the sample followed by "cc." the numbers at the nodes are the bootstrap values. the log likelihood value is −423.6 with 100 bootstrap replicates. cumulative incidence curves of rsv spread in two childcare rooms in season 1 and season 3. epidemic curve of rsv spread within childcare rooms by strain for the 12 sequenced

illness episodes with and without rsv detected respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection is the most important viral cause of severe respiratory tract infection in young children. 1 in the first year of life, 98% of children become infected with rsv, with frequent reinfections in their second and third years. 2, 3 the vast proportion of children with rsv are not hospitalized. the burden of rsv disease in the community is substantial, though molecular epidemiology of transmission is not well-characterized. [4] [5] [6] [7] in the united states, 41% of children attend childcare, 8 which is a known risk factor for severe rsv disease, and likely serves as an important route of transmission to other attendees and family members. 9, 10 the socioeconomic impact of illness associated with childcare attendance includes work days missed and parental stress. 11 a 16-year longitudinal study of childcare attendees in the 1980s using culture techniques showed that rsv was the most frequent viral etiology of respiratory illness. 2, 12 the molecular epidemiology of rsv transmission is characterized by sequencing the hypervariable region of the glycoprotein (g) coding region. 13 transmission of genetically identical virus as well as the presence of multiple distinct co-circulating strains have been described in nosocomial settings. 14, 15 no studies have been performed to characterize rsv disease burden in a community childcare setting using current molecular diagnostics despite its importance as a potential setting for public health interventions, such as vaccines and infection control measures.the goal of our study was to characterize the transmission and clinical impact of rsv in childcare. we hypothesized that the spread of unique viral strains within a childcare setting would be rapid. rapid transmission was defined as detection of an identical viral strain within a one-week period within the childcare facilities. we further hypothesized that rsv infections in childcare attendees would be associated with increased symptom duration as compared to infections with other respiratory viruses.children age 4 weeks-30 months attending full-time childcare on fort lewis army base, fort lewis, washington, usa were enrolled in a prospective cohort study from february 1, 2006 to april 30, 2008 , and from october 28, 2008 to june 30, 2009. 16,17 informed consent was obtained from caregivers. children were followed for the presence of respiratory symptoms, and the study nurse was alerted at symptom onset by childcare staff or caregivers. an illness episode was defined as at least 2 of 5 symptoms, including cough, rhinorrhea, fever, wheezing and nasal congestion. each child had a nasopharyngeal swab collected at symptom onset and weekly thereafter until symptom resolution. a daily symptom diary was completed by the caregiver for 10 days following symptom onset. from february 1, 2006 to may 1, 2006, nasopharyngeal samples were collected only with illness episodes. in children enrolled after may 1, 2006, a sample was also collected at time of enrollment regardless of symptom status.childcare centers designated as facilities x, y, and z were located several kilometers apart. children were enrolled from rooms where full-time care was provided, defined as >20 h/week. these included 6 of 11 rooms in facility x, 7 of 11 rooms in facility y, and 2 of 11 rooms in facility z. infection control procedures were performed and documented according to a standard operating procedure, including daily bleach disinfection of all toys, routine hand washing after toileting and diaper changes and before and after meals, and surface decontamination with bleach. 18 irb approval was obtained from seattle children's hospital and madigan army medical center.nasopharyngeal samples were tested for 13 respiratory viruses by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay, including rsv, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses a and b, parainfluenza virus 1-4, adenovirus, human coronavirus group 1 (229e, n6l 63) and group 2 (oc43 and hku1), rhinovirus, and human bocavirus. subtyping was performed for rsv-positive samples according to previously published protocols. 19, 20 rsv-positive samples were sequenced using a hemi-nested pcr protocol targeting the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein coding region. 21 complementary dna (m-mlv reverse transcriptase, usb corp, cleveland, oh) was amplified with forward primer gab (5 -ycaytttgaagtgttcaactt-3 ; g gene, 504-524 nt) and reverse primer fv (5 -gttatgacactggtataccaacc-3 ; f gene, 186-163 nt). the amplification procedure included 2 min at 98 • c, 35 cycles of 98 • c for 30 s, 55 • c for 1 min, and 72 • c for 1 min, followed by 72 • c for 7 min. a hemi-nested pcr was then performed using m13-tagged forward primer gab and reverse primer f1ab (5 -caactccattgttatttgcc-3 ; f gene, 3-22 nt) and 2.5 l of pcr product with the same protocol as in step 1. five hundred base pair amplicons were gel-extracted (qiaquick gel extraction kit, qiagen, germany) and sequenced (applied biosystems 3730xl sequencer). pcr products from some samples were cloned (topo ta cloning kit, invitrogen, grand island, ny) prior to sequencing. rsv-positive community samples during the same respiratory seasons were sequenced to serve as controls.sociodemographic, clinical, and virologic data were analyzed using stata 10.1 (stata corp, college station, tx). generalized estimating equations (gees) to account for multiple illness episodes per child were used to compare symptom duration (using identity link) and health care visit frequency (using poisson link) in rsv-positive and rsv-negative illnesses and viral load, symptom duration, and positive sample duration in rsv illnesses with and without another respiratory virus detected. univariable gee (using linear link) was used to estimate the influence of clinical characteristics on rsv viral load. cumulative incidence curves were constructed to describe rsv spread within individual childcare rooms. rapid transmission was defined as the presence of an identical viral strain within the childcare facility within one week. 16, 22 nucleotide sequences corresponding to a 205 and 305 base pair region of the g glycoprotein coding region for subtypes a and b, corresponding to nucleotides 5373-5577 for subtype a (genbank gu591768.1) and nucleotides 5406-5565 for subtype b (genbank nc 001781.1). these were aligned using seaview 4.3. 23 phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using phyml 3.0 within divein. 24, 25 neighbor joining trees were drawn using figtree v1.3.1 using the maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstrap replicates. 26 a slatkin-maddison test of compartmentalization of clades was performed to evaluate for sequence diversity. 27 nucleotide sequences were submitted to genbank (jx398254-jx398285).overall, 255 children were enrolled in the study; 110 (49%) were male. the median age at enrollment was 9 months (range, 1-26 months); median weekly hours of childcare attendance was 40 (range, 20-60 h), median number of siblings was 1 (range, 0-5 siblings), and the median duration of follow up was 210 days (range, 12-811 days). in total, 138 (61%), 72 (32%), and 15 (7%) children were enrolled at facility x, y, and z, respectively. the median age at enrollment was 8, 12, and 5 months at facility x, y, z, respectively. gender and number of hours of childcare attendance did not differ by facility. overall, 523 illness episodes occurred in 181 (80%) children with 332 (63%) episodes in facility x, 175 (28%) in facility y, and 16 (3%) in facility z (fig. 1) . the median number of illness episodes per child was 3 (range, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . a respiratory virus was detected in 429 (82%) of 523 illnesses. asymptomatic enrollment samples were collected for 127 (56%) children, and 89 (70%) of these were positive for a respiratory virus, with the most common viruses detected being rhinovirus (n = 57; 45%), bocavirus (n = 26; 20%), and adenovirus (n = 18; 14%).rsv was detected in 59 (11%) of the 523 illness episodes, and 3 (2%) asymptomatic enrollment samples. of the 59 illness episodes, 35 (59%) occurred in children under one year. compared to the 464 rsv-negative episodes (table 1) , rsv-positive episodes were associated with more days of wheezing (p < 0.001), fever (p < 0.001), cough (p < 0.001), congestion (p = 0.003), and an increased percentage of visits to a health care provider (p < 0.001) and childcare (p < 0.001) and parental work days missed (p < 0.001). the median duration of symptoms was 10 days (range, 4-10 days). the median initial viral load was 7.5 log 10 copies/ml (range, 2.6-10.0). initial rsv viral load was not correlated with age at illness onset (r 2 = 0.03; p = 0.22; data not shown), duration of detection of rsv (r 2 < 0.01; p = 0.73; data not shown) or number of days of symptoms (r 2 = 0.01; p = 0.43; data not shown). there was no relationship between age at illness onset and number of days of symptoms (r 2 < 0.01; p = 0.86; data not shown).in 42 (71%) rsv-positive episodes, at least one other respiratory virus was detected. the most common were bocavirus (n = 28; 67%), rhinovirus (n = 18; 43%), adenovirus (n = 18; 43%), coronavirus (n = 5; 12%), and parainfluenza type 3 (n = 5; 12%). duration of symptoms was not significantly different between illness episodes with and without another respiratory virus, though numbers of childcare and work days missed were increased ( table 2 ). the rsv viral load was not significantly different between rsv-positive episodes with and without another respiratory virus identified (16.1 vs. fig. 2a and b (1, 8 , and 6 episodes in seasons 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were not included due to occurrence outside of the time interval illustrated)]. we sequenced samples from 25 (42%) of 59 illness episodes as well as one nasopharyngeal sample collected from an asymptomatic child at enrollment. episodes that were sequenced were more likely to have higher viral loads (p < 0.001), but did not differ by date of collection (p = 0.71), implying that the inability to sequence a subset of samples was due to limited template rather than sample degradation. clusters of identical rsv strains were detected in childcare samples from the same seasons and within rooms, which were distinct from six community controls, eight reference sequences obtained from genbank, and viruses isolated during different time periods in the same childcare facilities. phylogenetic trees constructed for subtype a (fig. 3 ) and subtype b viruses (fig. 4) showed evidence of compartmentalized clades for subtype a (p < 0.001), but insufficient variation within subtype b strains to distinguish clades.we identified clusters of rsv episodes in rooms y11 (subtype b, season 1) and x3 (subtype a, season 3). during both clusters, 50% of enrolled children in each room were infected within six days of the first case (fig. 5) . in total, 8 of 12 children in y11 and 8 of 13 children in x3 developed rsv over a 16-day period. samples from two episodes 14 days apart in y11 contained the same rsv strain, as did 5 episodes in x3 that spanned the entire 16-day period. these results suggest that child-to-child transmission of one viral strain was likely responsible for these clusters of rsv illness. a third cluster of seven rsv episodes was identified in room x3 during season 1, consisting of two subtype a and five subtype b viruses. sequencing of the two subtype a episodes showed identical viral strains, while sequencing of three subtype b episodes showed two different viral strains, indicating that multiple viral strains co-circulated simultaneously in the childcare room (fig. 6) . in season 1, we identified four subtype b episodes with identical strains in rooms y11 and x3 from november 13 to december 8. at the same time, three subtype a episodes with identical strains were identified in rooms x3 and y2. these two facilities were located several kilometers apart, making it less likely that direct inoculation from child-to-child was the mode of transmission. no rsv-positive sibling pairs enrolled in the study were located in different facilities. however, sibling pairs who were not enrolled in the study or parents, many of whom worked on fort lewis, may also have transmitted rsv. in season 3, eight subtype a episodes with fig. 2 . epidemic curve of rsv spread within childcare rooms by subtype in season 1 (2a) and season 3 (2b) from november to january. the y-axis is the number of episodes. the x-axis represents time. each box represents one episode. the numbers and letters within each box represent the facility and room number of the child. one, eight, and six episodes in seasons 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were not included due to occurrence outside of the time period shown. identical strains were detected in facility x in rooms x3, x5, and x6 from november 18 to december 5, suggesting transmission both within and between rooms within facility x during season 3, with temporal and geographic clustering of two additional clusters of identical strains in december and march (fig. 6) .rsv was also detected in two sibling pairs, both in the same childcare room. in one sibling pair, rsv was detected simultaneously in both children. sequencing results from this pair showed identical viral strains in both children. in the other sibling pair, rsv was detected one week apart, though these samples were not sequenced.our study is the first to describe the molecular epidemiology of rsv transmission in childcare, a potential target of infection control interventions in the community. among childcare attendees in our study, rsv-positive illness episodes were associated with greater symptom duration, number of parental work and childcare days missed, and visits to health care providers than illness episodes without rsv detected. using molecular sequencing, we documented high rates of infection and transmission of identical rsv strains in childcare. within one week of the index case, we detected an identical viral strain in another child in the same facility. this same strain was detected in 7 additional children in the facility within a 16-day period.rsv viral load in hospitalized infants may predict duration of hospitalization and studies of experimentally rsv-infected adults show that peak viral load correlates with symptom score. 28, 29 we did not find a relationship between viral load and symptom duration. the criteria used to characterize disease severity in the inpatient setting may not be applicable to our outpatient population, or we may have captured both primary and secondary rsv cases, potentially impacting viral load.the significance of respiratory viral co-infection remains controversial. we found no relationship between co-infection and rsv viral load or symptom duration. four prior studies did not find increased rsv disease severity among hospitalized children when multiple viruses were detected. [30] [31] [32] [33] this is in contrast to a study showing that co-infection with rsv and human metapneumovirus was associated with increased disease severity compared to rsv alone, as measured by intensive care unit admission. 34 no children were co-infected with rsv and human metapneumovirus in our study.we documented simultaneous circulation of multiple rsv strains in an outbreak setting

our study shows that the childcare setting is a significant source of rapid child-to-child rsv transmission, and that once acquired, rsv leads to significantly greater symptom duration than other respiratory viruses. these results highlight the significant clinical and socioeconomic impact of rsv in the community, and emphasize that the childcare setting is an important potential site of interventions to reduce the burden of rsv disease. interventions that reduce rsv transmission in childcare, such as vaccines and enhanced infection control measures, are likely to have a substantial clinical and socioeconomic impact. the sentinel influenza surveillance system allows monitoring of the course and dynamics of epidemic seasons in poland. virological data tallied by 16 voivodship sanitary and epidemiological stations of the country allow to identify the dominant virus strain and to provide information on the age groups that are most vulnerable to the virus (cieślak et al. 2017) . monitoring of the influenza virus activity in the inter-pandemic period also is a part of the national surveillance plan in poland. the information about the emergence of a new pandemic strain can be obtained immediately, and thus the anti-influenza measures implemented at the national level (bednarska et al. 2016) .in 2009, the eu commission has issued recommendations in which it is assumed that the influenza vaccination rate in high-risk groups should reach 75% in all european countries up to the 2014/15 epidemic season. the risks groups included adults above 65 years of age and all persons over 6 months of age with chronic diseases (ecdc 2017). however, this goal has not been achieved in most of the countries (weimbergen 2018) . the vaccination rate in the 2017/18 epidemic season in the population of poland amounted to 3.4%. such a dismal vaccination rate places the country in the last place in europe (brydak 2019) . further, seasonal epidemics occur in poland every year, causing a large number of deaths and post-influenza morbidity, incurring huge socioeconomic costs (brydak 2018) . the epidemics cannot be properly countered without a proper population vaccination rate, the main preventive measure against influenza. this study seeks to define the dynamics of influenza infections and the prevalence of dominant viral types in poland during the 2017/ 18 epidemic season, based on the data tallied by the sentinel influenza surveillance program.the study material included nasal and pharyngeal swab samples analyzed in 16 voivodship sanitary and epidemiological stations and in the department of influenza research, national influenza center in national institute of public health -national institute of hygiene. data were analyzed and reported using the sentinel influenza surveillance system. a total of 1,585 patients participated in the study. they were divided into 7 age groups: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-25, 26-44, 45-64, and 65+ years. specimens collected from patients were analyzed for the identification of influenza type a and b viruses by pcr techniques. from a 200 μl clinical sample suspended in physiological saline, 50 μl of viral rna resuspended in rnasefree water was obtained. for the assay, a maxwell 16 viral total nucleic acid purification kit was used (promega corporation; madison, wi) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the analytes were further analyzed to determine viral subtypes using a light thermocycler 2.0 system (roche diagnostics; rotkreuz, switzerland). the primers and probes were obtained from the international reagent resource run by the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). the reaction was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. to obtain cdna, rna was subjected to reverse transcription (at 50 c for 30 min). then, cdna was subjected to the initiating process (1 cycle of 95 c for 2 min) followed by 45 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 c for 15 s, annealing at 55 c for 10 s, and elongation at 72 c for 20 s. positive control constituted viral rna obtained from the vaccine strains for the current epidemic season (a/michigan/45/2015 (h1n1)pdm09, a/hongkong/4801/2014 (h3n2), b/brisbane/60/2008), and negative control constituted rnase-free water.using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the presence of 15 respiratory viruses was confirmed in the samples. seoul, south korea) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. when the reaction was completed, the product was separated on a 2% agarose gel by electrophoresis.the probability of occurrence of influenza infection was estimated using a logistic regression model. odds ratios were calculated for all age groups with reference to the 65+ group. the statistical analysis was performed using commercial ibm spss statistical software (armonk, ny).in the (fig. 1) .comparing the recent epidemic seasons starting from 2014/15 up to 2017/18, an increase in the number of confirmed cases of influenza from 221 to 708 cases, respectively, is observed. an increase also is observed in the percentage terms, from 33.8% to 44.7%, respectively, although this increase has plateaued in the last season as the greatest, amounting to 46.6%, was observed in before last 2016/17 epidemic season (table 1 ).in then 2017/18 epidemic season, a total of 708 influenza infections and 28 influenza-like viral infections were confirmed. of the 708 influenza infections, 204 were due to influenza a virus and 504 due to influenza b virus. influenza a infections were dominated by the subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 (38 cases). influenza-like infections viruses were dominated by respiratory syncytial virus (16 cases).the findings of this study were reanalyzed in 7 successive age groups. the highest percentage of influenza b infections was found in the age group of 45-64 (21.6%) years, while that of influenza a in the group of 26-44 (7.6%) years. the dominance of influenza a over b was found only in the youngest age group of 0-4 years. there was a distinct dominance of influenza b virus in the remaining age groups (fig. 2) . the probability of occurrence of influenza a or b virus infection was estimated in relation to a given age group of patients, using the logistic regression model in which the age group of 65+ was taken as reference. we found that the probability of influenza a infection was three-fold greater among the patients aged 0-4 (p ¼ 0.001) and it was 50% lower than that of influenza b infection (p ¼ 0.028), compared with the reference group. the probability of influenza a infection among the patients aged 5-9 was 2.5-fold greater than that in the reference group (p ¼ 0.005). in addition, the probability of influenza b infection in the same age group of 5-9 years was 58% higher than that among the patients in the reference group (p ¼ 0.049). the differences between type a and b influenza infections in the remaining age groups, as compared to the reference group, were insignificant.the sentinel influenza surveillance system is an essential tool for monitoring influenza in poland. data from this system are key to determine the dynamics of season infections and to announce the epidemic by the relevant authorities in the country (cieślak et al. 2018; lee et al. 2018 ).comparing the increasing number of confirmed cases of influenza in the 2017/18 epidemic season in poland with other european countries, we notice almost the same situation. in germany, single positive samples have been recorded since the season's beginning, i.e., week 40 of 2017. the highest number of cases and the highest percentage of positive samples (over 60%) were recorded there in week 9, which closely corresponds to the polish data. in czech republic, the threshold of over 60% of positive specimens was achieved (adlhoch et al. 2018 ).in the 2017/18 epidemic season, the dominance of subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 among the influenza a subtypes was noticed. most cases were reported among the patients of 26-44 and 0-4 years of age. a similar situation took place in the course of the 2009 pandemic when the subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 had infected mainly children and young adults, while it was responsible for just 10% of hospitalization of the elderly (verma et al. 2012 ). in the previous 2016/17 influenza season, a/h3n2/ dominated in terms of the percentage of influenza cases; a subtype that is known for its propensity to infect the elderly (pebody et al. 2017) .over the last four influenza epidemic seasons, we have observed an increase in the percentage of confirmed influenza infections reported in the sentinel surveillance system. that shows a steady improvement in the surveillance system and in the knowledge and ability to recognize and verify the infection and its type. in the last two influenza seasons of 2016/17 and 2017/18, the percentage of confirmed cases ranged around 45%, which means that almost every second patient was properly diagnosed by general practitioners.the present report demonstrates the dynamics of the 2017/18 influenza season in poland according to the data from sentinel surveillance system. the virological data are valuable in that they serve to accurately determine the antigenic composition of vaccine for the next epidemic season.influenza reappears every season and is caused by circulating influenza type a and type b viruses. these viruses evolve through genetic mutations and resulting antigenic changes, what allows them to evade host immunity. influenza vaccines have to be updated periodically in order to be effective in the following season. hence, the constant need for seasonal vaccination. as it takes approximately 6 months to produce influenza vaccines, recommendations need to be done in advance. the world health organization (who) convenes annual meetings in february and september each year to establish the composition of influenza vaccine for the forthcoming season in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively (chambers et al. 2015; who 2014a; webster et al. 2013 the 2014/2015 influenza epidemic season in poland started in week 5 (january/ february) of 2015 and continued until week 17 (april) of 2015. the influenza activity was moderate with the highest incidence of influenza-like illness (ili) at week 10/2015 (march) (fig. 1) . during this season, 2416 specimens were tested for influenza and influenza-like viruses, of which 21.2 % (n ¼ 513) were positive for influenza. in detail, there were, 34.1 % (n ¼ 175) influenza type b, 14.6 % (75) influenza a/h1n1/pdm09, 22.6 % (n ¼ 116) influenza a/h3n2/, and 28.7 % (n ¼ 147) non-subtyped influenza type a. there was observed a co-circulation of influenza type a and b viruses, with influenza a being the most prevalent one (fig. 2) .infections caused by influenza-like viruses accounted for 11.2 % (n ¼ 270) of tested specimens. respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) was the other predominant virus, constituting 87.0 % (n ¼ 235) of all ili cases, followed by sporadic cases of human coronavirus (n ¼ 10, 3.7 %), parainfluenza virus-1 (n ¼ 8, 3.0 %), rhinovirus (n ¼ 6, 2.2 %), adenovirus (n ¼ 5, 1.9 %), and parainfluenza viruses 2 and 3 (n ¼ 3, 1.1 % each (fig. 3) ).the highest percentage of influenza and ili confirmed cases was noted in the 0-4 years -group (46.4 %) , followed by the 45-64 years (12.3 %) and 26-44 years age-groups (11.6 %). the lowest morbidity was observed in the 15-25 years (4.9 %) and 10-14 years age-groups (5.4 %) (fig. 4) . the verification of specimen testing by vses demonstrated a complete agreement with the results obtained at the national influenza center (table 1) .in the epidemic seasons 2013/2014 and 2014/ 2015 in poland, the number of specimens received from primary care physicians was similar, although the percentage of influenza and influenza-like infection confirmations was 10 % higher in the latter season. the 2014/2015 morbidity in children aged 0-4 years was twice as much as it had been in the former epidemic season. the vast majority of infections in this group of children was induced by influenza-like viruses (67.2 %). in both seasons, in the case of influenza-like viruses, the predominant virus was rsv. infections caused by other respiratory viruses occurred sporadically. influenza cases were caused mainly by influenza type a (83.2 %). the proportion of influenza b was significantly higher in the 2014/2015 season than that in the previous season where it amounted to 1.2 % of all influenza confirmations (bednarska et al. 2015) . while comparing data from poland and europe, it is apparent that the proportion of circulating viruses of influenza type a and b remains similar. in europe and the whole world alike, the dominant strain was a/h3n2/, but it co-circulated with influenza a/h1n1/pdm09. the predominance of the a/h3n2/ strain also was noted in poland, even taking into account the fact that not all the specimens tested within the sentinel and non-sentinel influenza surveillance were subtyped (broberg et al. 2015; ecdc/who 2015; who 2015; rolfes et al. 2014 ).in the 2014/2015 season, antigenic drift of the subtype a/h3n2/ decreased the effectiveness of vaccine against influenza. yet vaccination remains the most effective and the cheapest method of influenza prevention (broberg et al. 2015) . since 1968, the advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) recommends trivalent vaccines against influenza. they contain two subtypes of influenza virus a and one lineage of influenza virus type b. it should be emphasized that people, particularly those who receive vaccination every season, substantially enhance their immunological memory. community-acquired pneumonia is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in children, especially in developing countries. the disease accounts for approximately two million deaths per year and 20% of all deaths in children [mcintosh, 2002; sinaniotis and sinaniotis, 2005] . due to its significance in public health and social economy development [murphy et al., 1981; polverino and torres marti, 2011] , effective measures are needed to control this disease.community-acquired pneumonia can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, mycoplasma, and viruses. with the implementation of bacterial vaccines, such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, to the immunization programs and the use of antibiotics, bacteria-related community-acquired pneumonia has been effectively controlled. however, concern over respiratory viruses, particularly newly identified ones, has been rising due to their association with community-acquired pneumonia .human metapneumovirus (hmpv) is a non-segmented, negative-sense rna virus and a member of the pneumovirinae subfamily of paramyxoviridae family. it was first isolated from children with acute respiratory tract infections in the netherlands in 2001 [ van den hoogen et al., 2001] . the genomic organization of hmpv is similar to that of human respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) [van den hoogen et al., 2002] , harboring one open reading frame (orf) for at least eight viral proteins (3 0 -n-p-m-f-m2-sh-g-l-5 0 ) but lacking the non-structural genes, ns1 and ns2. hmpv is divided into four subtypes: a1, a2, b1, and b2 based on the genetic analysis of sequences of hmpv isolates [bastien et al., 2003; van den hoogen et al., 2004; huck et al., 2006] .since its discovery, hmpv has been recognized as a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide [stockton et al., 2002; boivin et al., 2003; maggi et al., 2003; peiris et al., 2003; esper et al., 2004; mullins et al., 2004; williams et al., 2004; garcía-garcía et al., 2006; caracciolo et al., 2008; kim et al., 2010] . it accounts for 4.1-11.5% of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia cases, depending on geographical location, year, and subjects studied [lin et al., 2005; cilla et al., 2008; mathisen et al., 2010; wolf et al., 2010; nascimento-carvalho et al., 2011] . although pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children less than 5 years old in china [rudan et al., 2010] , the etiology of pneumonia is not fully understood. several studies have reported the overall prevalence of hmpv infection in children in china [ji et al., 2009; li et al., 2009; chen et al., 2010; xiao et al., 2010 ], but few have investigated the role of hmpv in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in the country.in this study, the demographics, clinical manifestations, and epidemiological features of hmpv infection in pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia in beijing were evaluated by rt-pcr of hmpv rna in nasopharyngeal aspirates and analysis of clinical data, using rsv, a well-known agent of pediatric community-acquired pneumonia, as a control. hmpv subtypes associated with community-acquired pneumonia were also assessed.nasopharyngeal aspirates (npas) were obtained from 1,028 pediatric patients who had a primary diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia upon admission to the beijing children's hospital from july 2008 through june 2010. the majority of the patients (74.2%) were under 3 years old, although age ranged from 0.3 month to 16.5 years (mean age: 32.02 months, median age: 10 months). the male to female ratio was 1.8. the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia followed a guideline issued by the chinese medical association. in brief, community-acquired pneumonia was clinically defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia caused by an infection acquired outside the hospital [the working group for respiratory diseases of pediatric society, 2007; xiang et al., 2010] . all specimens were stored at à808c until use.detailed demographic, clinical presentations, and laboratory data were collected from clinical records. variables studied included age, sex, history of congenital heart disease or pneumonia, presence of clinical signs and symptoms, maximum temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, white blood cell counting, and c-reactive protein concentrations. the study was performed in compliance with the human experimentation guidelines of the chinese ministry of health.viral rna was extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates using nuclisens easymag platform (biomérieux, marcy 1'etoile, france), following the manufacturer's protocol. to detect and identify the four subtypes of hmpv, specific rt-pcr assays targeting the p gene of hmpv were performed as described previously [li et al., 2012] . the rt-pcr analysis was carried out using superscript iii onestep rt-pcr platinum taq kit (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca). pcr products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. the 240 bp amplicons were cloned into a pmd-18t vector (takara, dalian, china) and verified by sequence analysis. hmpv types/sub-types were determined by alignment of the pcr sequences with prototype strains of hmpv, including the isolates of subtype a1 (strain 00-1, genbank accession no. af371337), a2 (strain can97-83, genbank accession no. ay297749), b1 (strain nl/1/99, genbank accession no.ay525843), and b2 (strain can98-75, gen-bank accession no. ay297748) by blast (http:// blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi) and clustal w which is implemented in the dnastar software [burland, 2000 ]. an hmpv strain was assigned to a certain subtype when the pcr sequence showed the highest identity to the prototype strain of a specific hmpv subtype based on the results of blast and clustal w.in addition to hmpv, respiratory viruses including rsv, human influenza virus, human parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human coronaviruses (oc43, 229e, nl63, and hku1), enterovirus, and bocavirus were simultaneously detected using multiplex rt-pcr or single rt-pcr as described previously [ren et al., 2009; wang et al., 2011] .the association of demographics and clinical symptoms was compared between different patient groups using x 2 test or anova, as appropriate. statistical analysis was performed using spss version 16.0 (spss inc., chicago, il). p value <0.05 was considered significant.rt-pcr analysis shows that hmpv rna was detected in 65 (6.3%) pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia (40 males and 25 females). the detection rate of hmpv was only lower than that of rhinovirus (30.9%) and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv; 30.7%,), but higher than that of other respiratory viruses, including influenza virus (5.7%), adenovirus (5.5%), parainfluenza viruses (5.4%), human coronavirus (5.0%), human bocavirus (3.4%), and enterovirus (2.4%). these data indicate that hmpv plays an important role in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in beijing.hmpv-positive patients ranged in age from 1 month to 6 years (mean age: 16.78 months; median age: 8 months). hmpv was detected at a significantly higher rate in patients aged 36 months (7.9%) than in those aged !36.1 months (1.9%; x 2 ¼ 11.863, p ¼ 0.001). the patients aged 36 months represented 74.2% of the subjects studied, but accounted for 92.3% of the hmpv-positive patients (table i) .co-infections with other respiratory viruses were detected in 46 of 65 hmpv-positive patients (70.8%). these patients were mainly co-infected with rsv (n ¼ 27, 41.5%) or rhinovirus (n ¼ 25, 38.5%). other respiratory viruses, including influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human coronavirus, human bocavirus, and enterovirus were also co-detected (table ii) .the detection rate of hmpv fluctuated between the 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 years (fig. 1) . the detection rate of hmpv in 2008/2009 (42/540, 7.8%) was significantly higher than that of 2009/2010 (23/488, 4.7%;x 2 ¼ 4.065, p ¼ 0.044). in contrast, the detection rate of rsv did not fluctuate significantly, but remained constant at 32.4% (175/540) and 28.9% (141/488) in 2008/2009 and 2009/2010, respectively (x 2 ¼ 1.487, p ¼ 0.223).nucleotide analysis of the partial p gene showed that 40 (61.5%) patients were positive for hmpv-a2, in one patient, enterovirus and parainfluenza virus were also co-detected. f in one patient, human bocavirus virus was also co-detected. g in one patient, human coronavirus was also co-detected. h in one patient, rhinovirus was co-detected. i in three patients, rhinovirus was co-detected. j in one patient, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus were co-detected. k in one patient, adenovirus and human bocavirus were co-detected. 17 (26.2%) for hmpv-b2, and 8 (12.3%) for hmpv-b1 (table i) . no hmpv-a1 was detected. although hmpv-a2 was the dominant hmpv subtype during the study period, co-circulation with hmpv-b1 and hmpv-b2 was observed. in the study year 2008/2009, hmpv-a2, -b1, and -b2 were co-detected in october, november, december 2008, and march 2009; whereas hmpv-a2 and -b2 were co-detected in february 2009, forming an epidemic peak between late autumn of 2008 and early spring of 2009. in the study year 2009/ 2010, the co-circulation of hmpv-a2, -b1, and -b2 was observed in january 2010, whereas co-circulation of hmpv-a2 and -b2 was observed between march and june, forming a small epidemic peak in the spring and early summer of 2010 (fig. 2) . no hmpvpositive cases were detected in august and september 2008 or between april and december 2009.to characterize the clinical features of communityacquired pneumonia caused by hmpv, the clinical manifestations of hmpv-positive and rsv-positive cases were compared. to exclude the interference of co-infections, only the cases with single hmpv or rsv infections were evaluated.similar to rsv infection, fever, cough, expectoration, rhinorrhea, wheezing, and swelling of tonsils were the major symptoms observed in hmpv-positive patients with community-acquired pneumonia (table iii) . there was no significant difference in major clinical manifestations, gender ratio, the history of pneumonia or congenital heart disease, and laboratory data (e.g., white blood cell counting, hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation) between hmpv-positive and rsv-positive patients. however, the proportion of single hmpv infections was significantly lower (42.1% vs. 68.5%, x 2 ¼ 5.176, p ¼ 0.023) than that of single rsv infections in children under 6 months old (n ¼ 428).in this study, hmpv subtypes as well as hmpv clinical and epidemiological characteristics associated with pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in beijing were analyzed. the results show that hmpv plays an important role in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in beijing, china, as hmpv infections accounted for 6.3% of the cases from july 2008 through june 2010. hmpv was detected at a lower rate in beijing than in a study population less than 5 years old in israel (8.3%) [wolf et al., 2010] and in a study population less than 3 years old in spain (11.5%) [cilla et al., 2008] . however, the hmpv detection rate in beijing was higher than that reported in brazil (4.1%) for children younger than 5 years old [nascimento-carvalho et al., 2011] . it was also higher than that in nepal for children less than 3 years old (4.2%) [mathisen et al., 2010] , and that in taiwan, china for children less than 5 years old (5.2%) [lin et al., 2005] . these variable rates of hmpv detection may be attributed to variations in climate, location, and the populations studied.similar to previous studies [lin et al., 2005; cilla et al., 2008; wolf et al., 2010] , it was found that patients with community-acquired pneumonia positive for hmpv were co-infected with other respiratory viruses; 40% of patients were co-infected with rsv and 21.3% with rhinovirus. a higher rate of co-infection (70.8%) than previously reported was observed in hmpv-positive patients in this study. for instance, the rate of hmpv/rsv co-infection was 22.2% in israel [wolf et al., 2010] and 28.2% in spain [cilla et al., 2008] . the reason for this difference is unclear, but could be attributed to different detection methods. a direct immunofluorescence assay (dfa) and tissue culture methods were used in the study in israel [wolf et al., 2010] ; whereas a nested-pcr or pcr method different from the rt-pcr method employed here was used in the study in spain [cilla et al., 2008] . in this study, detection of bacteria in respiratory samples was not carried out, because such detection cannot be used as evidence for infections in respiratory samples [bogaert et al., 2004] . although there might have be a few community-acquired pneumonia cases in this study co-infected with bacterial pathogens, these exceptions should not affect the major findings described here.based on sequence analysis of the partial p gene of hmpv, three hmpv subtypes (a2, b1, and b2) were detected during the study period. consistent with a previous study [cilla et al., 2008] , hmpv-a2 was the most frequently detected subtype in pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia. hmpv-a1 was not detected in this study. hmpv-a1 was also not found in patients with other lower respiratory tract infections (data not shown). these results agree with those of previous reports from tianjin, china ] and from korea [chung et al., 2008] . in contrast, in taiwan, china (between february 2006 and february 2009) [wang et al., 2008 ] and in brazil (between january 2003 and december 2006 [oliveira et al., 2009] , all four hmpv subtypes were detected in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. in another report from gansu province, china (between december 2006 and november 2008), hmpv-b2 was not detected ; whereas in chongqing, china (between april 2006 and march 2008) , hmpv-a1 and hmpv-b1 were not detected . taken together with findings in this study, these reports suggest that the prevalence of hmpv subtypes varies among different geographical locations. long term surveillance of hmpv infections are needed to better understand the distribution of hmpv subtypes, to prevent possible outbreaks, and to inform vaccine development.in summary, the detection rate of hmpv ranked third in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and similar clinical manifestation was observed between hmpv-positive and rsv-positive patients. these findings indicate that hmpv plays a significant role in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in china. the findings also provide a better understanding of the epidemiological and clinical features of hmpv infections. highlights  fpia for detection of anti-h5 subtype avian influenza virus (aiv) antibody was achieved. usually infects intestinal cells of aquatic birds and does not show pathogenicity; however, it can infect poultry and cause pathogenicity. [3] [4] the virus that causes a high mortality when poultry were infected is designated as a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (hpaiv). to date, some h5 and h7 subtypeaivs have been reported to be hpaivs. [5] [6] [7] [8] h5n1 subtype hpaiv, which appeared after 1996, has been reported not only in poultry but also in humans. the mortality rate for humans infected with h5n1 is reported to exceed 50%. 9 if these hpaivs have acquired human-to-human infectivity, the deaths of many persons world-wide due to a pandemic become a concern.rapid initial response for a suspected infection and continuous surveillance are indispensable to prevent poultry epidemics of hpaiv and further human threats. [10] [11] when a diagnosis is performed at the site of a disease outbreak, a rapid, simple and accurate antigen detection method is required. on the other hand, in the process from a disease occurrence to its cleanup and under a usual surveillance system, antibody detection to check for previous infections also plays an important role. even in poultry that do not currently have the virus, the history of past infection can be determined by detecting antibodies. this is essential for investigating the routes of transmission of infectious diseases. as a recent example, antibody tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) have received broad attention to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19). [12] [13] although some antibody tests, such as the agar gel immunodiffusion test, hemagglutination inhibition test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are used for the detection of anti-aiv antibody, 14-18 these methods require complicated operations and a long reaction time. therefore, it is impractical to use these methods outside the laboratory. if the method is developed that can rapidly and easily provide antibody test results outside the laboratory, field applications become possible and the surveillance system using the antibody test can be significantly strengthened.fluorescence polarization immunoassay (fpia) is widely used in various fields and it has the degree of polarization (p) as a parameter. [19] [20] advantages of fpia compared to other immunoassays are the simplicity and rapidity of its procedures and the short measurement time. fpia does not need a washing step and the reaction is completed by simply mixing the reagents together. in this study, we developed a system that selectively detected anti-h5 aiv serum by measuring p value of the mixture of an anti-aiv serum and fluorescein-labeled h5 subtype hemagglutinin (ha) glycoprotein using a newly designed microdevice based on our previously developed microdevice with a portable fp j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 6 analyzer 21-23 ( fig. 1(a) ) . besides being portable, our fp analyzer is low cost and has high throughput, and these features make it possible to conduct fpia outside the laboratory. all procedures from sampling to obtaining measurement results can be completed on-site, and that contributes to a significant increase in efficiency of diagnosis and surveillance. kingdom).as an antigen for the fpia, recombinant h5 subtype aiv ha (h5-rha) was produced using the bacterial expression system as we previously described 25 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside was used to induce the expression of the partial ha gene. the protein extracted from the bacteria was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (ni-nta) agarose.the recombinant protein obtained was concentrated using an ultrafiltration membrane, and then dialyzed against pbs. the recombinant protein was identified by western blotting using anti-h5 mouse serum, and its concentration was measured by the micro bca protein assay kit. the resultant h5-rha was labeled using the lightning-link fluorescein conjugation kit.the goat antisera against h1-h15 subtypes and the chicken antiserum against h16 subtype aiv were kindly provided by dr. yoshihiro sakoda (hokkaido university, sapporo, japan). the immunogen of each serum is shown in table 1 .the basic pdms microfluidic device was fabricated using the standard soft lithography technique, as described in our previous work. 24 briefly, the mold was fabricated from negative j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f photoresist su-8 3050 and a silicon wafer (sumco co., tokyo, japan). the negative photoresist su-8 3050 was spin-coated onto a silicon wafer. the pdms prepolymer with black silicon rubber was poured onto the mold and cured. the cured pdms was pasted on a glass slide. figs. 1 (b) and (c) show a photograph and a schematic drawing of the microfluidic device. we designed the microfluidic device for this experiment based on the basic device. the microdevice had nine channels arranged in the field of view of the portable fp analyzer, and nine samples could be measured at one time. the width of the channel was 200 μm and the depth is 900 μm. the depth of the microfluidic device was significantly different from our previous device. by employing a channel having a high aspect ratio, it was possible to increase the fluorescence intensity per unit area and reduce specific surface area. these features contributed to highly sensitive measurement (fig. s1 ). the numbers in fig. 1 (c) denote inlets and outlets, and the solution was injected into the inlet with a pipet (eppendorf, hamburg, germany).we used our previously developed portable fp analyzer for fp measurement. 24 anti-aiv serum diluted in a prescribed ratio and 640 ng/ml fluorescein-labeled h5-rha were mixed at a volume ratio of 1:1. the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. then, 20μl of the mixture was injected into the microfluidic device and p value was measured with our portable fp analyzer. the fp analyzer acquired p images in the detection area. the p value measured was determined by reading out the luminance on the p image in the detection area of the microdevice. as shown in fig. 1 (c) , nine channels were placed within the detection area. therefore, nine samples could be measured simultaneously.in the fpia measurement, p value is expressed by the following equation: where i‖ and i are the fluorescence intensities of the vertical and horizontal components of the emitted light, respectively. a free fluorescence-labeled antigen emits random fluorescence when excited by polarized light and it gives a low p value. when a fluorescence-labeled antigen is bound to an antibody, p value is high due to the much slower brownian motion of the antibody-h5-rha complex. [19] [20] fig. 2 shows the schematic illustration of fpia in this work. when anti-h5 antibody in serum binds to a fluorescein-labeled h5-rha, p value becomes high. therefore, anti-h5 aiv serum containing a large amount of anti-h5 ha antibodies shows a higher p value than that of the antibody-negative serum. in this work, we used the fragment of h5-rha (not whole h5-rha) as an antigen to improve the sensitivity. using a smaller fluorescence-labeled antigen reduces p value of the blank sample. fig. 3 shows an example of a p image obtained using our portable fp analyzer. samples used were a mixture our microdevice required 20 μl of solution per one channel. since serum and fluorescein-labeled h5-rha were mixed at a volume ratio of 1 : 1, the required serum volume for an analysis was 10 μl.when a serum with 5-fold dilution was used for the analysis, the required volume of the original serum j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f was 2 μl. it would be sufficiently small for application to on-site diagnosis and surveillance.therefore, 5-fold dilution of antiserum was used in the next experiment.next, we verified whether our system could selectively detect anti-h5 aiv serum in anti-h1-h16 aiv sera. fig. 6 shows the p value obtained with anti-h1-h16 sera. the cutoff value for positive anti-h5 aiv antibody was defined as the average + 3sds. anti-h5 serum showed the highest p value among all anti-aiv sera and all other antisera except where anti-h5 was below the cut-off value.therefore, we showed that there was no false positive result with other anti-subtype sera. the incubation time was 15 min (total analysis time was within 20 min), which was significantly shorter than the time needed by conventional elisa-based devices. these findings showed that our fpia system selectively detected the anti-h5 aiv serum.we developed the rapid and easy-to-use system for the fpia detection of anti-h5 aiv serum.analysis time was within 20 min and required sample volume was only 2 μl. our portable fp analyzer with the microfluidic device makes it possible to conduct on-site analysis. further study on blocking of protein adsorption to pdms devices may lead to improved sensitivity and selectivity of a detection. table   table 1 immunogens of goat anti-aiv sera. influenza viruses are the most common cause of respiratory infections, resulting in high morbidity and mortality (taubenberger and morens 2008) . influenza is an infectious disease caused by influenza virus type a or b. the occurrence of influenza, whose viruses are characterized by great seasonal antigenic changeability, may vary in different districts of a country. in poland, epidemiological surveillance of influenza was implemented in collaboration with primary care physicians and laboratories of 16 voivodeship (province) sanitary epidemiological station (vses) as of the 2004/05 epidemic season. the information on influenza and influenza-like infections has been gathered in all districts by means of both sentinel and non-sentinel systems. since the 2013/14 epidemic season, data consisting of the number of samples tested, suspected and confirmed cases of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths in each province are stratified into seven age-groups (hallmann-szelińska et al. 2016a, b; bednarska et al. 2015) . these data are then further elaborated and randomly checked for correctness of viral identification in the national influenza center (nic) at the national institute of public health-national institute of health (niph-nih 2016). the nic serves as a reference center for individual virological vses laboratories of the country. the aim of the present study was to determine the regional differences of influenza activity in poland in the 2015/16 epidemic season. the savvy of such differences might be of help in setting apart resources for preventive and therapeutic actions to combat the epidemic. the q-rt-pcr was used for a molecular examination of the presence of influenza viral material.the analysis was carried out using a light thermocycler 2.0 system (roche diagnostics; rotkreuz, switzerland). the reaction proceeded in capillaries of 20 μl volume. primers and probes necessary to carry out the reaction were obtained through the influenza reagent resource (irr) program from the us center for disease control (cdc) the reaction mixture contained mgso 4 , reaction buffer -bovine serum albumin (bsa), rnase free water, and a superscript ® iii/platinum taq mix (invitrogen life technologies-thermo fisher scientific; carlsbad, ca), with the addition of 5 μl of the previously isolated rna for each sample. the positive control constituted the rna strains that were the following vaccine components for the 2015/16 epidemic season/2016: a/h1n1/pdm09 (a/california/7/2009), a/h3n2/switzerland/ 9715293/2013, and b/phuket/3073/2013. as for the negative, rnase-free water was used. before the start of amplification, the rna was rewritten to obtain cdna, using the enzyme reverse transcriptase at 50 c for 30 min. then, samples were analyzed as follows: initialization at 95 c for 2 min and 45 cycles of amplification consisting of denaturation at 95 c for 15 s, annealing at 55 c for 30 s, and elongation at 72 c for 2 min.in the 2015/2016 epidemic season in poland over eight thousand five hundred specimens for influenza and influenza-like viruses were examined. the presence of influenza virus was found in over three thousand cases. the number of confirmed cases and share of various types of virus are presented in fig. 1 . the majority of confirmations of influenza were found in the pomeranian (72%), masovian (62%), and subcarpathian (55%) provinces. in other provinces, influenza was confirmed in less than half specimens investigated ( fig. 1 and table 1 ).we further found that the predominant subtype of influenza a virus in the 2015/16 season was a/h1n1/pdm09 that was detected in high percentage of influenza infection in several provinces, such as pomerania (80%), podlaskie (76%), subcarpathia (74%), lubuskie (71%), silesia, and warmia-masuria (69%), with a smaller contribution from other provinces. in (table 2) . type b virus predominated in west pomerania (69% of infections) and also accounted for a substantial share of more than one third of the confirmed cases in lesser poland (table 2) .poland provinces. in other regions of the country these infections were rather sporadic (fig. 1) . the respiratory syncytial virus was the most common cause of ili. other viruses, such as human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229e/nl63, parainfluenzavirus 1-3, coronavirus oc43, and rhinovirus a/b were identified in individual cases. (brydak 2016) . this subtype was recommended as a component of influenza vaccine in the 2015/16 epidemic season (who 2015) and it also is going to be included into the 2016/17 vaccine (who 2016). influenza virus type b was the most frequent in the west pomerianian and swietokrzyskie provinces, accounting for more than half of the confirmed infections (table 1) . a similar number of cases of influenza b and influenza-like infections was observed in the opole and greater poland provinces, amounting to about 30% each. the majority of deaths occurred in the region of silesia (33), in which the most frequently detected virus was influenza type a. there also were 25 deaths reported in greater poland, where virus type a (39%), b (32%), and viruses causing influenza-like illness (29%) were at a grossly comparable level. the who estimates that 1 million people die each year due to influenza infection (brydak 2012) .the present virological data indicate the predominance of infection with influenza virus type a in the eastern polish provinces: subcarpathian (91%), lublin (80%), and podlaskie (74%), lying near the border with russia. these infection may be related to border trafficking between the two countries as type a virus was confirmed as predominant from week 3 of 2016 in russia (kimissarov et al. 2016 ). however, predominance of type a virus in 2015/16 was also confirmed in slovakia, ukraine, belarus, and lithuania (flu news europe 2016).a decline in the number of confirmed cases of influenza virus subtype a/h3n2/, which accounted for only 1% in the kuyavian-pomerianian and masovian provinces, was observed in 2015/16 compared with that in 2014/15 (bednarska et al. 2015) ; a situation similar to that also noted in russia where this subtype caused only sporadic infections (kimissarov et al. 2016) . in contrast, predominance of influenza virus type b was observed the west pomerania that lies west of the provinces above mentioned near germany where type b virus was found to predominate in the 2015/16 influenza season (flu news europe 2016). therefore, it seems that the regional differences in the type of influenza virus causing infections in a given season have in all probability to do with the epidemiological situation in neighboring countries.coronaviruses are new viruses. although there have been many timely discoveries for this virus, there are still many things unknown [1, 3] . i designed a novel tool named the dna nucleotide footprint plotter. corona strains (fig 6) . even if the method is designed to observe structural changes at the genomic level that single nucleotide polymorphism calling tools cannot identify, it is possible to show genotype changes and amino acid changes at a single nucleotide resolution. in addition, dna footprint plotter is a useful tool to determine the evidence of recombination. a recombination between corona virus there are three ways to plot dna footprint plots. they are acat, agac, and atag. acat is used as an example. if the nucleotide is a, then x value plusses 1 (x+1). if the nucleotide is t, then x value minuses 1 (x-1). if the nucleotide is c, then y value plusses 1 (y+1). if the nucleotide is g, then y value minuses 1 (y- the method aims to demonstrate structural variations at higher levels that single nucleotide mutation callers cannot identify. however, the tool can precisely demonstrate single nucleotide information (fig6). the method itself has no limit to plot the number of nucleotide bases. but due to the size of computer screens and paper, too many bases will cause the lines to overlay each other. thus the sizes of virus genome or segments of eukaryote genome are recommended for one particular plot. one plot can display a complete virus genome, and users can combine multiple plots together to visualize more complicated genomes such as the genomes of eukaryotes. or if only a partial virus genome or a particular gene are of interest, the corresponding regions can be displayed by dna foot plotter. coronavirus demonstrates a unique footprint (fig 1) , and so do other types of viruses (fig 2-5 13 dna footprint plotter is useful for character identification at the genome level. it can identify key features in the genome that single nucleotide mutation callers will miss. it can also be used as an add-on tool of phylogenic trees. phylogenic trees are very useful to group and compare viruses. but the detailed differences are not shown. if we can also apply dna footprint plot, people will have a better idea regarding which regions are similar and which regions are different, as well as the patterns of differences.in addition to viruses, dna footprint plots can be applied to visualize single genes or groups of genes in higher organisms to facilitate the understanding of gene structure. it can also help to identify diseasecausing structural variations such as repeats in diseases like huntington's disease.if we digitalize the key features of the footprint shapes within genomes and genes, we can use machine learning, such as neural networks, to recognize various viruses and genes [5] .dna footprint plotter is a novel tool to display the characteristics of virus genome, genes, and sections of eukaryote genome. it is a quick and convenient method to visualized the features of corona virus dna to distinguish them from other viruses, and to understand the differences of coronavirus sub species.in recent years, human migration has accounted for the spread of pathogens, such as sars-associated coronavirus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and hiv, on a worldwide scale. molecular epidemiological study is an important tool to investigate such epidemics at the level of virus subtypes or genotypes. in many of the articles on hiv-1, the subtype bf recombinant is often found in south america and is occasionally seen in europe, but has so far been unheard of in asian countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] we hereby report the detection of multiple hiv strains in injection drug users (idus) in macao, which appear to be derived from subtypes f, g, and crf12_bf.macao is a special administrative region of china with a total population of less than half a million. the hiv prevalence in macao has remained low over the years with an average of 20 to 30 hiv/ aids cases reported to the health bureau under the notifiable diseases ordinance each year. in those reported, sexual transmission has been the main route of hiv transmission. in 2002 and 2003, none of the reported cases came from the drug injecting community. in 2004, however, 18 of the 30 reported hiv infections (60%) were found in idus.we examined the sequences of the hiv-1 strains from idus in order to determine whether there was a common source for the outbreak, and to assess the relationship among similar sequences in other parts of the world.a total of 14 hiv-infected idu samples (genbank accession numbers listed in figure 1 ) collected from 2002 through 2007 by the macao public health laboratory were examined. nested pcr followed by sequencing was performed to obtain the gag, pol, and env fragments. we used sample sequences of polymerase of 634 bp (regions covered: protease, 256-297; reverse transcriptase (rt), 1-592), gag of 284-296 bp (p17, 144-396; p24, 1-43), and envelope of 242-249 bp (gp160, 908-1158; gp120, 908-1158) to align with reference sequences retrieved from the los alamos national laboratory hiv database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov); the resulting neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees are shown in figure 1 a-c. we report the detection of multiple hiv strains in injection drug users (idu) in macao, which appear to be derived from subtypes f, g, and crf12_bf. a total of 14 hiv-infected idu samples were collected and examined. direct sequencing was performed to obtain the gag, pol, and env fragments. the subtypes of individual viral sequences were determined using the rega subtyping tool. the concatenated sequences were aligned with reference sequences retrieved from the los alamos national laboratory hiv database. we found 11 unusual cases in macao, which showed characteristics of crf12_bf (n = 2) and crf14_bg (n = 8), and one that could not be classified into an existing subtype/crf, along with three cases of crf01_ae. interestingly, the sequences derived from subtypes bg and bf recombinants have not been previously reported in any other asian cities. another subtype, crf14_bg, has also been introduced into macao among the idus. in conclusion, human activity, including travel over long distances and injection drug usage have fueled the spread of hiv and have provided a platform for recombination, which may otherwise have taken years to happen.ß 2010 international society for infectious diseases. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.the results revealed 11 unusual cases, which showed characteristics of crf12_bf (n = 2) and crf14_bg (n = 8), and one that could not be classified into an existing subtype/ crf, along with three cases of crf01_ae. antiviral drug resistance analysis (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/ adra/adra2.html) showed no special drug resistance mutations in the pol sequences. in addition, since six samples were epidemiologically linked (mo007, mo021, mo106, mo108, mo112, mo113), one of the samples, mo108, was subtyped by rega subtyping tool after whole genome sequencing ( figure 2 ). in the figure, it can be seen that it is a triple recombinant bfg.except for the three crf01_ae sequences probably originated from the same southeast asian region, the sequences derived from subtypes bg and bf recombinants have not been previously reported in any other asian cities, including the neighboring areas of hong kong and mainland china. 5 to study the possible geographical origins of these sequences, a blast search was performed and the genbank records and literature of the matches were studied. samples mo008 and mo009, from two portuguese manifesting characteristics of subtype g matched with sequences from spain and portugal; whereas the monophyletic group similar to crf12_bf (mo007, mo021, mo106, mo108, mo111, mo112, mo113 and mo114) matched with sequences mainly from brazil and a few from europe (supplementary table) . the high query coverage and high similarity in gag and pol regions of mo008 and mo009 suggested that the year of first hiv-positive diagnosis was around 2000, which is in concordance with our records. sample mo010 shared characters of both bf and bg recombinants -its gag shared some similarity with that of mo008, while its pol and env shared some similarity with mo108, implying a recombination event.the key question is how the two uncommon strains emerged. crf12_bf circulates in south america, and has been reported to be associated with sexual, idu, and mother-to-child transmission. 4, 6, 7 although a major human migration between macao and south america seems unlikely, as a colony administered by portugal before 1999, migration between macao and europe could reasonably have occurred. the most common hiv subtypes in portugal are b, g and crf14_bg. 8, 9 coincidentally a cluster of crf12_bf was reported in idus in southern portugal in 2003, shortly before the macao outbreak. 10 subtype f strain has also been reported in the european countries of spain, 2 portugal, 8 and italy. 11 the temporal and spatial information alongside the blast results suggests that idus in portugal could have acquired crf12_bf from south america and in turn introduced the strain into macao. another subtype crf14_bg has also been introduced into macao among the idus.in conclusion, human activity, including travel over long distances and injection drug usage have fueled the spread of hiv and have provided a platform for recombination, which may otherwise have taken years to happen. rapid and cost effective genomic surveillance of rna viruses is a critical component of vaccine and drug development pipelines for the control of emerging viral diseases. improvements in sequencing technology and the concomitant decrease in costs have made it easier and more common for the re-sequencing of large genomes as well as parallel sequencing of small genomes. this has led to an exponential increase in the genomic data available in public databases. however, accurate gene prediction is a challenge that has created a bottleneck in the gene predication pipeline.two major approaches, ab initio gene finding and similarity-based prediction [1] , have been commonly applied to gene prediction. the ab initio method, also known as the intrinsic statistical strategy, computes statistical data such as the nucleotide frequencies and their ordering in a set of genomic sequences that have been characterized. this is because the nucleotide frequencies and ordering for each genome usually differ between protein coding and non-coding regions. however, viral genomes, because of their small genome sizes, may not provide sufficient training data to derive the parameters necessary to attain the best performance possible for this approach. the heuristic method, which determines the parameters of the necessary models from short sequences, was adopted by several gene prediction programs, e.g., genemarks [2] . small amount of genomic sequence, but long enough to produce the efficient markov models, usually a small fraction of large genome or small genomes like viral genomes, is needed for this method. the linear function reflecting the relationship between the nucleotide frequencies in the three codon positions and the global nucleotide frequencies is obtained by analyzing the small amount of dna sequence. these derived data will be used to predict protein coding genes by the heuristic method [3] . the ab initio method uses these trained or self-trained modules to select the protein coding regions and predict coding sequences. the similarity-based method predicts protein coding sequences by a different strategy, identifying gene coding sequences by sequence similarity alignment to reference sequences which are closely related evolutionarily. since these two approaches use different strategies to detect the protein coding sequences, the performances are different and depend on the training data set and reference sequence data. usually, ab initio approach is more sensitive than similarity-based approach, while the performance of similarity-based method has greater specificity. this is because ab initio methods predict some false positive exons and genes in intergenic regions and introns, while similaritybased tools cannot detect genes if the homologous sequences are not included in the reference data.although most viral genomes are relatively small compared to eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, the gene structure of viral genomes can be complex. for example, introns, alternative splicing, overlapping genes, and ribosomal slippage exist in many viral genomes. thus an all purpose gene finder cannot be easily adapted for gene prediction across all virus families. however, if the genome scaffold and the gene features of a viral genome are well understood, a similarity-based gene prediction approach based on the curated gene repertoire for a specific virus genus with attention to particular recognition features, such as, splice sites and mature peptide cleavage sites can be adapted, and perform better than an ab initio gene finder.the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) funds a genomic sequencing center for infectious diseases (gscid) at the j. craig venter institute (jcvi). one of the goals of the gscid is high throughput sequencing of various viral pathogens. the viral genome sequencing projects at jcvi have resulted in publication of more than 4000 influenza virus genomes from clinical and animal reservoir specimens, and hundreds of coronavirus and rotavirus sequences. prediction of protein coding genes encoded in these viral genomes is a critical step to understanding these pathogenic viruses. in order to have a flexible, accurate gene prediction tool for utilization in high throughput viral genome sequencing projects, we developed a viral annotation program, vigor (viral genome orf reader). vigor uses a similarity-based approach to detect open reading frames (orf) in various viral genomes by similarity searches against custom reference protein sequence databases. vigor takes into account differences between the genomic structures of viral taxonomic groups. vigor is tailored for the designated viruses with complex gene features such as splicing and frame-shifting, and it is able to predict genes accurately in influenza (group a, b, and c), coronavirus (including sars coronavirus), rhinovirus, and rotavirus genomes. it was also designed to assign function to the predicted orfs and genotype influenza viruses. in addition to gene prediction, vigor can also be used as a tool to validate sequence accuracy and completeness during the genome finishing process.complete protein sequences of all orfs for influenza virus, rotavirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus subtypes were downloaded from genbank, and redundant sequences were removed by custom scripts. for coronavirus and sars coronavirus, both the orf1a polypeptide sequences and orf1b polypeptide sequences were included in the coronavirus and sars coronavirus reference database.similarity searches between viral genomic sequences and a custom protein database are conducted by blastx [4] . the longest aligned region detected by the similarity search spanning one single protein sequence plus 100 bases upstream and downstream sequences is selected as the potential coding region for the particular open reading frame. this region is then further searched for genomic features indicative of the coding region.a similarity search is performed again between the potential coding region and the custom protein database. the protein sequence with highest identity in the similarity search is established as the reference sequence for the identification of the start and stop codons. if the first codon in the potential coding sequence is atg and aligns with the first residue in the reference sequence, this atg is selected as the start codon; otherwise, the nearest upstream in-frame atg is selected as the start codon. if no in-frame atg is present in the upstream region of the aligned sequences, the 60 nucleotides downstream of the first aligned residue are scanned for the start codon. sequences downstream of the last aligned residue of the potential coding sequence are scanned for in-frame stop codons (taa, tga, and tag) and the closest stop codon to the last aligned residue is selected. mature mrna for the influenza m2 and ns2 genes is produced by internal splicing. the conserved splice donor and acceptor sites (gt...ag) [5] are scanned around the alignment joint sites between the gap and aligned regions. the splice sites which result in the best alignment between the translated protein and the reference sequence are selected. the two main criteria for the selection of splice sites are identity to reference sequence and sequence length of the translated protein; however, if these two do not agree with each other, sequence length has priority in choosing the final splice sites.the first transcript of coronavirus genomes and sars coronavirus genomes encodes two polyproteins because of ribosomal slippage during translation [6] . the first polyprotein (orf1a) is translated from the sequence with start and stop codons, and normal translation, while the synthesis of the second polyprotein (orf1ab) is dependent on a -1 nucleotide ribosomal frameshift induced by a "slippery" sequence of the type "uuuaaac" upstream of the orf1a stop codon [7] . vigor examines the region upstream of the orf1a stop codon to map out precisely the "uuuaaac" string. it then shifts back the reading frame by -1 nucleotide (from aac to aaa) within the slippery sequence, and the -1 frame is extended to generate the coding sequence for the translation of orf1ab.there are 16 subtypes for hemagglutinin protein (ha) and 9 subtypes for neuraminidase (na) in group a influenza viruses, but only one subtype for ha and one subtype for na for influenza b viruses [8, 9] . the genotypes of influenza viruses can be categorized by the hemagglutinin protein (ha) and neuraminidase (na). in the custom vigor database, ha and na subtype sequences are stored and used to categorize the genotypes of these two influenza proteins based on the best similarity.6. identification of the mature peptide cleavage sites for the rhinovirus polyprotein and sars coronavirus orf1a and orf1abthe rhinovirus polyprotein is cleaved into 11 mature, functional peptides by proteases. there are conserved cleavage signature sequences for 9 cleavage sites [10] . in order to predict mature peptides, the polyprotein sequence is aligned with the sequences in vigor's custom rhinovirus mature peptide database to identify the mature peptide cleavage sites. in the absence of a conserved signature sequence, the putative cleavage site whose products result in best alignments for both sequence length and similarity is selected.the conserved mature peptide cleavage signature sequences for the orf1a and orf1ab of sars coronavirus derived from sequence comparative alignment and literature [11] [12] [13] . at the position p1 (the position just before the cleavage site) is the conserved glutamine (q), the signature residue recognized by papain-like proteinase. mature peptide cleavage sites are determined by mature peptide length and conserved cleavage signature sequences.(i) coding sequences must have both start and stop codons, or span the 5' or 3'-end of the input sequences for partial genomic sequences.(ii) there should not be an internal stop codon or frameshift in the coding sequences except for the orf1ab in coronavirus genomes and sars coronavirus genomes.(iii) the exon number must be the same as that of the homologous gene in the custom database. (iv) the translated product of the coding region must span 95% of the length of the homologous protein unless the homolog in the reference database is shorter than 50 amino acids except influenza genomes. for influenza genes, if the encoded protein is 500 amino acids or longer (pb2, pb1, pa and ha), the translated product must span more than 98% of the length of the reference protein; the length difference between the translated product and the reference protein should be within 5 amino acids for ns2 and m2 genes (shorter than 150 aa); the encoded ns, mp, np and na proteins should not be 15 amino acid shorter than reference proteins.(v) if any of these criteria is not observed, the sequence region homologous to reference sequences will be identified as a non-functional gene region, and will be marked as a possible sequence mutation.vigor is available at http://www.jcvi.org/vigor. viral genomic sequences in either fasta or multi-fasta format can be pasted or uploaded from a local file into the input sequence area through a gui interface which was implemented in perl cgi, php and javascript. vigor is supported by a multi-tiered backend service called arcturus. this service includes the capability to receive and process all types of web form submissions.the submission component transforms the submitted data into a job and the queuing component schedules the job for processing. a post-processing component formats the results and notifies the submitter that the gene predictions can be viewed following the completion of the job.arcturus is responsible for invoking the appropriate gene prediction program in the vigor package for the specified virus type. currently, all jobs are executed on a single, dedicated server. the backend service is implemented to support scalability. the entire backend service was implemented in perl.a user needs to select the virus type through a pulldown virus name menu prior to submitting the sequence data. the user will be informed of the link to download the prediction result by email following the vigor run. the output includes three files. the main output file is the gene prediction file which includes the predicted peptide sequence length, coordinates of the coding regions, splice sites if applicable, protein function and genotype if available, and the predicted amino acid sequences. the other two output files are the cdna sequence file and a file of the alignment between the predicted protein and the best match in the custom database so that the user can evaluate the prediction. if mutations which generate internal stop codons or frameshifts are detected, the mutated sequences plus the flanking sequences will be presented in the output. the alignment data from the blastx search is also included in the gene prediction file.to assess the performance of vigor, five sets of annotated sample sequences were downloaded from gen-bank. these included influenza virus, rotavirus, coronavirus, sars coronavirus and rhinovirus. vigor was compared to three separate gene finding programs: genemarks, zcurve_v and flan. genemarks [2] and zcurve_v [14] both are ab initio universal gene finding programs. flan is a web-based gene prediction tool specific for influenza viruses that was developed at ncbi for the influenza genome sequencing project and has been widely used to annotate influenza sequences [15] . flan uses the similarity based approach, comparing the influenza genomic sequences with annotated influenza peptide sequences to identify open reading frames. genemarks and zcurve_v were run for all sample genomes, while flan was run only on influenza genomes.the results were evaluated by comparison between the gene finder predictions and annotations in genbank. sensitivity (sn) and specificity (sp) were employed to evaluate the performance of the programs tested. sn is defined as the percent correct predictions out of all annotated genes in the dataset. sp is defined as the percent correct predictions out of all predictions. correct predictions are those which are the same as the gen-bank annotations. any prediction that was not identical to the genbank annotation was inspected manually by similarity searching against the ncbi non-redundant (nr) protein database. if the new prediction was highly similar (e value <1e-10) to a viral protein spanning 95% of the homologous protein length, it was categorized as a correct prediction. a partially correct prediction was assigned when the prediction overlapped with the gen-bank annotation in the same reading frame but with a different start codon. an incorrect prediction was assigned when the prediction overlapped with the gen-bank annotation but in a different reading frame, or cannot be validated by sequence similarity.the influenza virus genome consists of eight rna segments that encode one or two proteins each. splicing is involved in the expression of the mp and m2 proteins from segment 7 (mp segment) in group a influenza viruses and ns1 and ns2 proteins from segment 8 (ns segment) in both group a and group b viruses [16] . segment 2 (pb1 segment) encodes two proteins, pb1 and pb1-f2, in some influenza genomes. the coding sequence of pb1-f2 is completely embedded in the pb1 coding region with a different reading frame [17] . in order to test its accuracy in gene finding, 2376 full and partial influenza segment sequences including group a, group b, and group c viruses, encoding 3177 annotated proteins, were run through vigor. vigor predicted 3178 orfs encoded by these segments. among these predicted protein sequences, 99% (3169/3178) orfs completely agreed with the annotations in genbank. three predicted orfs were partially correct and one orf was incorrectly predicted ( table 1) .the influenza sequence set was also run through flan (influenza specific gene prediction program). the specificity and sensitivity of flan are quite comparable to vigor (table 1) . however, 47 genes annotated in genbank were predicted as non-functional genes by flan because of different problems detected in these sequences including internal stop codons, frame shifts or incorrect splicing. these predictions were marked as discrepancies in table 1 . nine small orfs detected by flan were missing from the vigor prediction list; all of these were homologous to pb1-f2 protein. these pb1-f2 proteins predicted by flan were manually compared to the homologous pb1-f2 sequences. it was found that multiple stop codons are present in the region homologous to the n-terminal domain of pb1-f2. although the annotations in genbank for 6 of these nine sequences are same as flan predictions, most likely all these nine sequences encode non-functional pb1-f2 genes.the same set of influenza genomic sequences was also run using genemarks and zcurve_v, two ab initio approach gene prediction tools for viral genomes ( table  1 ). the specificity and sensitivity for genemarks was 40.63% and 35.22% respectively; while the specificity and sensitivity for zcurve_v was 81.74% and 72.27%. similar numbers of genbank annotated genes were missed by both genemarks (770 genes) and zcur-ve_v (841 genes). manual inspection showed that the majority of the overlooked genes were pb1-f2, ns2 and m2 genes. several studies have shown that embedded genes and splicing often pose problems for viral gene prediction algorithms [2, 14] . for example, zcurve_v could not identify the tat gene correctly and missed the rev completely when it was used to predict genes for the hiv-i virus [14] . additionally, almost half of the genemarks predictions for influenza genomes picked start codons upstream of the correct start codons.rotavirus genomes are made up of 11 segments of double stranded rna encoding 6 viral structural proteins (vp1-4, vp6-7) and 6 non-structural proteins (nsp1-6). non-structural protein 5 and 6 are encoded by same genomic segment; the coding regions overlap, but are in different reading frames [18] . 19 g types and 27 p types of rotaviruses based on structural proteins vp7 and vp4 were recorded we downloaded from genbank 1166 rotavirus sequence segments with 1158 annotated genes, and ran in parallel vigor, zcurve_v and genemarks analyses. vigor predicted 1202 protein coding genes including 44 newly detected orfs which were not annotated in genbank. three predictions picked different start codons compared to the annotations in gen-bank. these new predictions were examined closely and all of them are homologous to nsp6 with very good similarities (e-value < 1e-10, data not shown).zcurve_v performed well for rotavirus genome gene prediction ( table 1) . 1112 of the 1171 predictions were the same as the annotations in genbank. both the specificity and sensitivity are approximately 95%; only one protein coding gene was not picked by zcurve_v, and 45 were predicted with different start codons. the performance of genemarks was limited for rotavirus gene prediction. approximately 64% of the predictions (776 predictions) selected the wrong start codons (table 1) .the rhinovirus genome encodes one polyprotein precursor which is cleaved into eleven functional mature peptides [20] . thirty-six annotated rhinovirus genomes were downloaded from genbank and tested with vigor, genemarks and zcurve_v. vigor correctly predicted the polypeptide start codon and stop codon, as well as the mature peptides for each genome (see table 2 ). genemarks identified all 36 polyproteins, but predicted the wrong start codons for four genomes. an additional nine small orfs were incorrectly predicted in the 5'-utr. zcurve_v predicted 77 genes in total, including the 36 true orfs and 41 mis-predicted small peptides. the start codons of 6 real open reading frames were not correctly predicted. vigor was also used to predict the polyproteins and mature peptides for 66 atcc rhinovirus samples and field samples sequenced at jcvi with 100% specificity and sensitivity [21] . neither genemarks nor zcur-ve_v was designed to predict mature peptide sequences for viral genomes.coronavirus genomes are 27 to 31 kb in size and encode 9-15 proteins. the genomic structure of each species in the coronavirus genus is highly variable [6] with considerable species diversity among the non-structural proteins. the first open reading frame occupies about 2/3 of the genome, and ribosomal slippage occurs in the expression of this transcript, producing two polypeptides (orf1a and orf1ab) which are cleaved into functional mature peptides. coronavirus genomes also encode overlapping genes and genes which are completely embedded within other genes.to evaluate the performance of vigor for coronavirus gene prediction, 38 annotated complete coronavirus genomes containing annotation for 341 genes were downloaded from genbank and run through vigor, genemarks and zcurve_v. vigor identified 354 orfs, while genemarks and zcurve_v predicted 314 and 339 protein coding genes respectively (table 2) . of the 341 genbank annotated genes, vigor correctly predicted 339 genes, missed one gene and identified one gene with wrong start codon ( table 2) . vigor also predicted 14 new orfs which were not annotated in gen-bank. manual curation of these 14 newly predicted proteins showed that they are highly similar (e value < 1e-10) to annotated coronavirus or other viral proteins (data not shown); thus we classified these 14 newly identified genes in coronaviruses as correct predictions. of the 341 annotated genes, genemarks and zcur-ve_v did not detect 48 and 34 genes respectively. most of the missing genes were short overlapping genes. the small structural envelope protein coding gene in 10 coronavirus genomes was not identified by either of these two programs because the coding region of this envelope protein overlaps with the coding region of an upstream gene.vigor was also evaluated and used successfully for the gene prediction of more than 50 coronavirus genomes sequenced at jcvi; the specificity and sensitivity were greater than 99% [22] [23] [24] [25] .vigor has been adjusted as well to optimally predict the protein coding genes in sars coronavirus genomes. we downloaded from genbank 102 annotated sars coronavirus genomes, containing a total of 1322 annotated genes. vigor, genemarks, and zcurve_v were run for these sars coronavirus genomes to identify protein coding genes. vigor detected 1447 orfs, 1321 of which completely agreed with the annotations in genbank (table 2) . only one genbank annotated gene was missing on the vigor prediction list. vigor also found 126 orfs in these sars coronavirus genomes which were not annotated in genbank. by searching the ncbi nr database, the similarity search showed that these 126 newly detected genes encode proteins highly similar (e value < 1e-10) to proteins in sars coronavirus or other viruses. zcurve_v predicted 1204 genes, 958 of which were identical to the annotations in genbank. one hundred seven zcurve_v predictions have different start codons compared to the annotations in genbank ( table  2 ). this program also detected 76 new orfs which did not exist in genbank; as with vigor, the encoded proteins are highly similar to other viral proteins in gen-bank (data not shown). sixty-three predictions may be incorrect since they could not be corroborated by similarity searches. these were either small peptides (shorter than 50 aa) or were located within the first long open reading frame.genemarks detected only 941 genes and 680 of them were precise predictions. one hundred nineteen predictions hit the correct regions with the correct frame but the start codons were incorrect ( table 2) . genemarks also picked 21 new orfs which are similar to other viral proteins. one hundred twenty-one genemarks predictions may be incorrect since no homologous proteins could be found in genbank. two hundred fiftyseven and 523 genbank annotations were missing on the zcurve_v and genemarks prediction list. these missing genes were examined closely, and most of them are overlapping genes, such as, non-structural protein 3b, 9b, envelope protein, or the gene encoding a nonstructural protein which is completely embedded within the coding region of nucleocapsid protein.the gene predictions from two sars coronavirus genomes (nc_009695 and ay485277) are detailed in table  3 . nc_009695 is the genomic sequence of a bat sarslike coronavirus published in 2005 [26] . the annotations have been updated several times by different annotators. this genome encodes 14 orfs in genbank. vigor predicted 13 orfs and detected one mutation which resulted in a truncated non-functional peptide ( table 3 ). the 13 predicted orfs were exactly the same as the annotations in genbank. the mutation detected by vigor is located in orf3b and generates an internal stop codon, creating truncated peptide of 114 amino acids. the orf3b gene in other coronaviruses is~154 aa long. we believe this truncated protein is non-functional. zcurve_v identified 11 orfs but missed the two short orfs (28094-28387, 28544-28756) which are completely embedded in the coding region of the nucleocapsid protein. genemarks detected 8 orfs but ignored 3 additional orfs. one was the envelope protein gene (26056-26286), and the other two were non-structural protein genes (27573-27707, 27713-28082). both genemarks and zcurve_v did not predict the orf1ab correctly.ay485277 is another sars coronavirus genome that has 8 orfs annotated in genbank [27] . vigor predicted an additional 7 orfs (table 3 ). these 7 orfs were corroborated by comparing them with other viral proteins in genbank. zcurve_v detected 12 orfs including 5 orfs which were not annotated in gen-bank; these 5 orfs are highly homologous to other viral proteins. one orf annotated in genbank and two orfs predicted by vigor were ignored by zcur-ve_v. genemarks identified 9 orfs. three genbank annotated genes were missing, and 3 vigor predictions were also missing from the genemarks prediction list. neither genemarks nor zcurve_v predicted orf1ab protein correctly.two ab initio gene prediction programs, zcurve_-cov [28] and genedecipher [29] , were specifically trained and the program parameters were adjusted for sars coronavirus genomes. both programs can correctly predict the major large protein coding genes and structural protein coding genes like polyprotein orf1a, orf1ab, spike gene, nucleocapsid gene, envelope gene and membrane protein gene. however, short peptide genes and embedded genes were often missing on the predicted gene list (false negative) [29] , although the exact function of these small peptide genes is unknown. mature peptide prediction is not a designed function for these two programs. 17 of the 18 sars-cov genomes tested by genedecipher were used to evaluate vigor predictions. since there were no annotations for most of these genomes in genbank, sars-cov genome tor2 genome was annotated in genbank and predictions were listed [29] , a detail comparison was done for this genome (data not shown). the predictions of vigor for sars-cov genome tor2 were exactly same as the genbank annotations. genedeciper didn't pick 6 small non-structural protein genes and predicted one gene incorrectly. the genome structure and genes of the other 16 tested sars-cov genomes are same as sars-cov genome tor 2, 14 genes and one non-functional non-structural protein gene were detected in these genomes by vigor.vigor usage in high-throughput viral genome closure and annotation vigor has been used extensively to validate the genomes in the finishing process for the high-throughput virus sequencing projects at jcvi [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 30] . in this role, vigor is used to detect sequence changes which generate a premature stop codon or a frameshift. the potential sequence error and the flanking sequences as well as the blastx alignment results are presented in the prediction output. this data allows researchers working on finishing tasks to investigate whether the sequence changes are due to laboratory error or are biologically relevant snps or in/dels. we noticed that if a mutation or a sequence error generates a pre-mature stop codon or causes frame-shift, and the translated product still meets all criteria stated above, vigor will predict this gene as a functional gene. in this type of cases, vigor prediction may not be able to identify the potential sequence errors. however, vigor provides the alignment data between the predicted peptide and reference sequence in the output alignment file, users can use the alignment data to evaluate the prediction and identify the potential sequence errors. if a genomic sequence covers only a fraction of a gene coding region, vigor will identify this genomic sequence as partial sequence. genome finishing team is able to pursue finishing the genome basing the missing regions identified by vigor.vigor has also been used in the gene annotation and submission process. one of the advantages of vigor is that it can be used on large numbers of viral genomes simultaneously. the efficiency of vigor varies depending on the viral sequence type used as input. for example, using four hundred and fifty eight influenza genomes (6 mb in total of nucleotide sequences) vigor took 85 minutes to complete the gene predictions. in comparison, it took vigor 23 minutes to execute the gene prediction for 102 sars coronavirus genomes (3 mb in total nucleotide sequences). table 3 comparison of the annotations in genbank and predictions by vigor, genemarks and zcurve_v of two sars coronavirus genomes, nc_009695 (nc) and ay485277 (ay)we have demonstrated that vigor, a rna virus gene prediction tool, can predict protein coding genes with high accuracy for 5 different rna virus types, influenza virus, rotavirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and sars coronavirus. vigor is available for public use at http:// www.jcvi.org/vigor. vigor has been thoroughly field tested in several high throughput genome sequencing projects at the jcvi. vigor has been employed to predict the protein coding genes successfully for 51 newly sequenced group a rotavirus complete genomes sequenced at jcvi [30] and to annotate and predict mature peptides for 66 rhinovirus full genome sequences [21] . the similarity based program has been also used to annotate the published sequences of bovine, feline, human, murine, rat, sars and several novel wild animal coronavirus genomes [22] [23] [24] [25] . partial genomes and the potential sequence errors which generate premature stop codons or frameshifts were identified by vigor as well during the genome finishing process for these viral sequencing projects.vigor detects protein coding sequences based on similarity searches in conjunction with the known genome specific features for the particular viral genomes. genes with introns, overlapping genes, and even the genes with a frameshift due to ribosomal slippage can be identified accurately because vigor includes these complex mechanisms in the processing for the designated genomes. both the specificity and sensitivity of vigor for the tested genomes was greater than 99%. the same sets of viral genomes were tested for two existing universal viral gene predication methods, the specificity was between 31% and 95%, and the sensitivity was from 35% to 96%. vigor was designed to predict the mature peptides accurately for rhinovirus genomes and sars coronavirus genomes, which is not applicable for the existing universal gene prediction tools. vigor can also conduct genotyping and assign function to the predicted protein, both of which are not capable for most available viral gene prediction tools. this userfriendly program is convenient for high throughput sequencing projects and for use by individual laboratories. if reference protein sequences can be collected, and genome specific features are added to vigor, this program can extend its capability to predict the protein coding genes in many other small viral genomes.•

causes of upper and lower respiratory tract diseases in infants and young children, causing croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [1] . ari is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality all around the world. however, due to social, nutritional and environmental factors the risk of death due to ari is 30 times higher in developing countries than in the northern hemisphere [2] . while rarely causing death in industrialized countries, aris cause enormous direct and indirect health care costs [3] . in a relatively large proportion of samples obtained from persons suffering from ari, no pathogens can be detected despite the use of a wide range of sensitive diagnostic assays; even in the most comprehensive studies, a causative agent (either viral or nonviral) can be identified in only 38-85% of the patients [4, 5] . according to the who reports, causes about 4 million annual deaths of children under 2 years and about 20 to 40 percent of hospitalized children at the health centers are associated with acute respiratory infections [6, 7] .major outbreaks of influenza are always associated with influenza virus type a or b, especially influenza type a virus which has been accounted for four worldwide pandemics during the twentieth century. due to virus evolution and migration, the transmission of respiratory viruses between animals and humans has been a very severe matter. because influenza virus infection is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can spread easily by droplets or nasal secretions and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality [8] . it is estimated that influenza a viruses cause the death of approximately half a million individuals worldwide every year [9] . it associated with illness among all age groups, but the risk of serious illness and death following infection is highest among persons aged ≥65 years and persons with certain chronic medical conditions. also, rsv is known for its tendency to 1 the article is published in the original. cause bronchiolitis in infancy, but it can infect all agegroups causing illness indistinguishable from influenza [10] . although rsv infection is the most important viral cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infection, only a small proportion of children infected with this virus develop severe disease. increased understanding of the virus and the host response to it, has resulted in expanded therapeutic and preventive options. adenoviruses also produce a variety of serious diseases in people of all ages. the mode of transmission of adenovirus infections includes respiratory, fomite, droplet, venereal, and faecal-oral routes. they have been shown to spread with ease in aids patients, in young children and in hospitalized patients. a constant rate of about 8% of world-wide reported virus infections were observed to be due to adenovirus infections [11] . in the case of coronavirus, many isolates have been reported to cause upper respiratory tract infections in both children and adults [12] . coronaviruses cause wheezing in young asthmatic children but only rarely cause wheezing in normal children.determining etiological diagnoses for patients admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms remains a clinical and laboratory challenge. infections with respiratory viral infections are traditionally diagnosed using viral culture, rapid antigen test, and direct immunofluorescence (dif) tests [13] . however, over the last 2 decades, nucleic acid amplification techniques, particularly real-time pcr, have become available as diagnostic tools due to its high sensitivity and rapid turnaround time [14] . aim of the present study was to determine the frequency and mortality of the viral respiratory infections including influenza virus type a, influenza virus type b, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), coronavirus, and adenoviruses in patients with ari that referred to central hospital in northwest of iran during september 2014 till may 2015.from september 2014 till may 2015, 143 respiratory specimens for viral testing were collected from central hospital in tabriz, northwest of iran. the specimens included nasal washes in saline, nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium, bronchoalveolar lavage throat or oropharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, or sputum. patient's selection was consecutive and samples were included two respiratory samples collected in special sample collection tubes. all patients had acute onset of respiratory symptoms accompanied by fever and a recent travel history to countries with sustained human-to-human transmission of rsv, coronavirus, adenovirus, influenza virus type a and b, and were analyzed with further assay.after obtaining written informed consent from the parents, we collected demographic data, information on the nature and course of illness, medication, complications, duration of stay, parental absenteeism, and follow-up information. information was supplemented by review of medical records and structured telephone interviews. data collected from the hospital database included the number of referrals to the central hospital in northwest of iran, the number of acute admissions, and the discharge diagnoses for referrals and admissions.real-time rt-pcr was done based on who protocol [6] . viral rna was extract from clinical specimen with qiaamp viral rna mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany), according to manufacturer's instructions. for each test sample and positive and negative controls, real-time ready rna virus master kit (roche, germany) was prepared. after adding 5 μl viral rna to the above mix, one-step real-time rt-pcr was performed according to the following conditions: the reverse transcription for 8 minutes at 50°c followed by 30 s at 95°c, 45 cycles of 95°c for 1 s, 56°c for 20 s, 72°c for 1 s, then 1 cycle of 40°c for 30 s using the rotor-gene 3000 (corbett research, sydney, australia) and were analyzed by using a software (roter-gene version 6.1, corbett, australia). the primers and probes were used as described in who protocol [6] .rsv and adenovirus were identified by coris-bio concept immonochromatography diagnosis test (coris bioconcept, gembloux, belgium) for detection in swabs and nasopharyngeal secretions. every sample was diluted in test buffer and strips were added and final results were compared with positive controls (rsv and respiratory adenovirus positive controls were provided by coris-bioconcept). also, sample of suspected patients for coronavirus were sent to center of infection control for identifying by allele specific rt-pcr method (ministry of health, tehran, iran).data were analyzed by the χ 2 test or fisher's exact test. spss version 21 was used for statistical analysis.from 143 patients that referred to central hospital in northwest of iran during the 9-month period, 69 (48%) cases obtained from females and 74 (52%) cases obtained from males. patients were investigated when clinical signs for viral infection were positive including radiographic signs, fever and etc. among suspected patients, 91 (64%) samples were negative for all viruses that we have studied and 52 (36%) samples were posi-tive at least for one virus. the distribution of samples according to sex and the presence of viral agents have shown in table. fifty (35%) cases of suspected patient were older than sixty, 91 (64%) cases were between 10 to 60, and 2 (1%) cases were younger than 10 years old. in positive cases, sixteen (31%) of cases were older than sixty, 34 (66%) cases were between 10 to 60 and 2 (3%) cases were younger than 10 years old. also, 14 (10%) cases of suspected patients were died, which 6 cases of them belonged to negative result for viruses. while 9 (64%) cases of dead ones were older than sixty years old and rest of them were between 10 to 60 years old. three (6%) cases of positive results were positive for 2 viruses that the first one were positive for both h1n1 and adenoviruses, the second one were positive for both h3n2 and adenoviruses and the third one were positive for both h3n2 and rsv. among 3 cases that were positive for both viruses, one of them was died. among the positive results 2 (1%) cases were younger than 10 years old that both of whom were male and were positive for rsv. sixty six (46%) cases of suspected patient were lived in tabriz and 76 (53%>) cases were lived in countryside and 1 case was lived in turkey. from six suspicious patients to coronavirus, no one was positive. also, there was no significant relationship between the presence of viral agents and positive bacterial culture (p > 0.05).the study showed that among the all cases of respiratory infection, 46%> cases were positive for influenza a that 46% of them were subtype h1n1 and 54% cases were subtype h3n2. also, 40%) of cases were positive for influenza b. in the case of rsv and adenovirus, 13% and 6% of cases were positive, respectively. in spite of other viruses, no positive results were observed for coronavirus. these reveal the importance of above mentioned viruses, which associated with ari in hospitalized patient and the different epidemiological patterns in tabriz, iran. a study that carried out in kerman province revealed that from 168 specimens, 18 cases (10.7%) were infected with adenovirus and 63 cases (37.5%) with rsv [7] . this rate is slightly higher than the result obtained in this study that may be because their study was conducted on children under 2 years. in another study that conducted in a tehran hospital on children with acute respiratory infection, influenza a virus, rsv, and adenovirus were detected in 4.4, 5.7, and 6.3%, respectively [15] . in the detection of seasonal influenza a viruses using rt-pcr assay during 2009 flu pandemic in golestan province showed, 13 (8.49%) were infected with seasonal influenza h1n1 and 25(16.33%) with seasonal h3n2 influenza [16] . in their study, the rate of infection with seasonal h1n1 and h3n2 was similar to other studies reported from iran, but lower than the rate reported from other parts of the world. a survey that conducted during influenza a (h1n1) pandemic in 2009 showed, of 3672 confirmed cases, 140 (3.8%) deaths were occurred [17] . however, the mortality rate in our study, of 52 suspected patients among all viruses was 8 (15.2%).acute respiratory tract infections are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in humans and animals, and the costs attributable to acute respiratory tract illnesses in humans are an important burden on national health care budgets [4] . the morbidity and mortality from influenza and rsv vary from year to year, from community to community, and from institution to institution, and an accurate estimate of disease burden requires temporal, geographic, and institutional breadth [18] . according to who latest data on h1n1 influenza, at least 13554 deaths related to 2009 h1n1 pandemic have been reported and nearly 883 of them were reported from who regional office for the eastern mediterranean (emro) [19] . in studies of respiratory virus detection among children hospitalized with respiratory illness from different parts of the world, rsv and influenza are frequently associated with a substantial proportion of hospitalizations [20] . although human adenovirus infections are less common in adults than other respiratory virus infections, such as influenza viruses, human rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, and human coronaviruses, they can cause fatal respiratory tract infections in affected patients [21] .influenza occurs all over the world, with an annual global attack rate estimated at 5-10% in adults and 20-30% in children. in temperate regions, influenza is a seasonal disease occurring typically in winter months: it affects the northern hemisphere from november to april with a peak in february and the southern hemisphere from april to september. a cor- relation between influenza activity and climate has previously been suggested for other countries [22] . vaccination remains important as a means of reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza viruses. the h1n1 influenza virus, which caused the 2009 pandemic, continues to circulate in some parts of the world, causing variable levels of disease and outbreaks. in some countries, seasonal trivalent vaccines are available that cover the h1n1 (2009) virus. in other countries, however, seasonal influenza vaccines are not available. who advises that there is still public health value in using monovalent h1n1 vaccine (where available) to immunize persons at risk of severe disease from h1n1 influenza infection, especially where trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine is not available. however, for individuals who cannot be or have not been vaccinated or when vaccine is not available, antiviral agents can provide an important alternative. groups at increased risk of severe illness from the pandemic h1n1 virus included young children, pregnant women, and people with underlying respiratory or other chronic conditions, including asthma and diabetes. patients who have severe or deteriorating influenza should be treated as soon as possible with oseltamivir. patients who are at higher risk of severe or complicated influenza should be treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible.travelers, like local residents, are at risk during the influenza season. in addition, groups of travelers (e.g. on cruise ships) that include individuals from areas affected by seasonal influenza may experience out-ofseason outbreaks. travelers visiting countries in the opposite hemisphere during the influenza season are at special risk, particularly if they do not have some degree of immunity through recent infection or regular vaccinations. in this study, almost half of the patients were living in small towns or rural areas with different climatic conditions and different prevalence of viral diseases. these patients are often referred for treatment to central hospital in northwest of iran and may have a role in the transmission of the disease to new areas. given the non-specific symptoms of these viruses and the high prevalence of viral diarrhea in our region, more laboratories should be equipped for virus detection and vaccination might be considered as a prevention strategy. to detection of influenza viruses, pcr method widely used, which its materials and equipment's is available in many countries. however, the rate of mutation in the ha and na genes of the influenza virus is high. therefore to determine the subtypes, we used to specific primers that suggested by cdc. also, real-time pcr considerably increases the diagnostic yields for respiratory viruses from patients admitted with respiratory symptoms within a clinically relevant time frame. this allows clinicians to initiate optimal patient management and to initiate adequate (future) use of antiviral therapy and optimal infection control [23] . therefore, we can conclude that: (a) in spite of general conception, the viruses that investi-gated in our study have shown endemic distribution among the study period. because of spreading rumors about ebola disease outbreaks on social networking, a wave of fear in people who had similar and even mild symptoms were created. however, lastly it considered as an epidemic of influenza or possible coronavirus. (b) our results indicated that rapid test method which was used in the present study showed less positive results in compare with rt-pcr method, (c) in the case of influenza b, we had the same mortality or more than influenza a which possibly is in contrary with others, (d) finally, we should conclude that we need to develop local protocols and strategies in the case of viral infections, and how we have to act when we face with micro-epidemics' and endemics to prevent more distribute of the infection.in considering the ecology of the avian viruses and their impact on life on earth, it may be useful to first consider the host itself. the class aves first diverged from the reptiles between 150 and 300 million years ago, depending on which current paleontological interpretations one accepts. of the vertebrate classes, they are most often compared with the reptiles from which they evolved and with mammals because of their common warm-blooded nature. this shared feature with mammals is probably the most influential with respect to ecology, since a virus adapted to warm-blooded physiology would not fare well in the cold-blooded world, and vice versa. along these lines, our recent experience is that some virologists think that a bird is a bird, and that if a given virus replicates in one, it will replicate in them all. this is, of course, far from the truth and perhaps should be a starting point for discussing avian virus ecology.according to fossil records, the class aves emerged from the extinctions of the late cretaceous period 65,000,000 years ago, somewhat bottlenecked, as did the class mammalia, but since that time they have undergone parallel evolution with mammals and are equally diverse in their own right. certainly some viruses, such as avian paramyxovirus 1 (of which newcastle disease virus is the prototype), are infectious for numerous orders of birds. there are also other important avian virus strains such as the gallid herpesvirus 1 (infectious laryngotracheitis) and the avihepadnaviridae, which appear to be exclusively confined to a single bird family or even genus. it is clear that birds, because of their close association with powered flight, do present a more homogeneous anatomy and physiology than do the class mammalia (feduccia, 1996). whether this affects or specifies the molecular nature of viruses that infect birds is not really known. this feature, however, almost certainly uniquely impacts the natural distribution and ecology of the viruses that inhabit the flying birds. a virus infecting or persisting in an arctic tern could potentially be translocated up to 12,000 miles in a few weeks. viruses such as some avian orthomyxovirus or avian paramyxovirus strains, which may exhibit subclinical infections, might be shared among a migrating flock of waterfowl and persist for indefinite periods as the flocks move from lake to lake. along the way the virus might be shared with other birds crossing flight paths. so birds do present unique environments for transmission of viruses.the commercial practices of humans have further provided unique opportunities for transmission not normally seen for birds. the order galliformes in particular, which includes domestic and wild fowl; pheasants, quail, and turkeys, has been unquestionably affected. it would be quite safe to say that humans have both determined and upset the ecological balance among members of this order and the viruses that affect them. due to continuous breeding practices, live-virus vaccination regimes, and by housing tens of thousands of birds in a single enclosure, situations never encountered in natural settings are created. whether this has affected the virus-host ecological balance in other orders of undomesticated birds as well is not known; but it would seem highly likely.one of the most important features of a host-parasite relationship, of course, is the host's immune defense. while there are similarities shared with respect to the immune system, particularly the dual (humoral and cell-mediated) nature, there are marked differences between cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates and additional significant differences between birds and mammals (eerola et al., 1987). the discovery of processing and maturation of immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes was made as a result of characterization of an avian-specific organ, the bursa of fabricius (ratcliffe, 1989). although functional equivalents exist in mammals, the bursa is a distinct and wholly avian-specific organ. since several viruses are known to affect this organ specifically, it should be considered a unique ecological niche.a second significant difference in the immune system of birds is in the apparent genetic content responsible for specifying the avian major histocompatibility complex (mhc). the chicken mhc appears considerably more simple (providing the oxymoron: a simpler complex) than the mammalian mhc (kaufman and wallny, 1996). several alleles have arisen and considerable recombination documented in the mammalian mhcs that thus far have been studied. these are responsible for producing a great variety of class i-, ii-, and iii-type proteins used in recognition and presentation of antigen. in the chicken, some mhc haplotypes produce only one type of class i protein and there is no evidence for recombination at all (kaufman and wallny, 1996). this has led to speculation that the relationship with the avian pathogens has evolved significantly differently from the mammals. one result of this difference may be the occurrence and frequency of either resistance or sensitivity to specific viral infections encountered in chickens (see below). thus, the class aves presents several unique features that might ultimately affect the ecology of viruses that infect them.the classification of birds has presented a significant challenge to systematists. the number of species has actually decreased over the years because of the clearer genetic relationships that have emerged. conversely, additional species have been defined as recognition of convergent evolution has become clearer. currently, new species are identified at a rate of about two per year. while there remains some disagreement among specialists, most accept the current classification of 30 orders, 174 families, 2044 genera, and 9020+ species (gill, 1990). molecular analysis of avian genes for phylogenetic studies is still in its early stages. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis and sequence analysis of 12s mitochondria dna has yielded some molecular phylogenetic information but not enough to gain any insight regarding the viruses of birds (hedges et al., 1996; cooper and penny, 1997; mindell et al., 1997). roughly speaking, the flightless orders represented by ostriches, rheas, cassowaries, and kiwis are thought to be the most ancient, while the bewildering array of members of the order passeriformes (representing 60% of known species and 40% of known families) are thought to be the most recent (gill, 1990). trying to determine how long viruses have been associated with various avian groups is of course as impossible as it is with virus–host relationships in any other classes. orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses have recently been isolated from ostriches, rheas, and emus, indicating no absolute barriers in these more ancient birds.the class aves is of course distributed worldwide. in addition, there are several hundred species that migrate, sometimes in spectacular fashion. biogeographers have divided the earth into six distinct faunal regions, which correspond somewhat with the major continental areas (welty, 1982). these include the nearctic (north america and greenland), palearctic (asia, europe, and north africa), ethiopian (central and southern africa), oriental (india, southeast asia), australasian (australia, new guinea), and neotropical (south and central america). each area contains its own characteristic birds. in the northern hemisphere (nearctic and palearctic), most species are migratory, which is not the case in the other areas. the neotropical has the richest and most abundant bird life, and the southern hemisphere has by far the most families represented, as well as the most families peculiar to a given region.each year, billions of land birds and waterfowl in north america and asia head south to south america and africa, respectively, carrying their viruses with them. the size and scale of these geographic relocations are unmatched by any other land vertebrates. the sea mammals are the only other comparable migrating vertebrates, and they surely cross paths with the birds. in the most interesting putative contacts, purely avian-origin type a orthomyxovirus of at least two different subtypes were isolated from dead and dying seals off the coast of new england in 1980 and 1982–1983 (webster et al., 1981b; hinshaw et al., 1984). this represents viral ecology at its most forceful, being effected between two warm-blooded vertebrate orders during their natural migration and geographic interaction.if one takes a broad look at the virus families associated with avian hosts (table i ), it is actually easier to list the families of viruses that infect vertebrates but that do not yet have a clear avian member. these are the iridoviridae, arenoviridae, african swine fever-like viruses, and filoviridae. a similar comparison of families that do not contain a mammalian member yields only the birnaviridae. so, in one sense, the mammalian host might be considered more virus-friendly, rather than the alternative. still, many investigators think of bird tissues, in particular the embryo, as being an ideal medium for identifying new viruses. if just from an experimental and practical, rather than a natural, point of view, the avian host has played a tremendous role in our understanding of viral ecology. many of the most important findings in virology have been made utilizing the chicken embryo and in chicken cell cultures. the egg also continues to provide an abundant and important substrate for the production of veterinary and human vaccines.if we think of ecology as the study of organisms and their relationship with their environment to include all other organisms, we most certainly encounter a unique relationship with viruses. unlike higher pathogens, viruses really do not mate, communicate, or colonize (except in the very broadest stretches of the imagination); they simply parasitize and replicate. we try and make them more familiar by defining higher organism-type genetic alterations as “evolution,” when in truth the viruses may simply be adapting to the evolutionary pressures encountered by, or within, its host. obviously, the host is central to the viruses’ lifestyle and must be considered a major part of virus ecology. in this sense, information gathered on various viruses as they replicate in embryos or embryo cells, in the absence of immune pressure, should only be considered “natural” for those viruses that are transmitted vertically. the embryo or cell culture then can only provide a window on the natural ecology of the organism in which the immune system is not a factor. in ecological terms, only the natural state of the virus–host relationship becomes important. viruses being parasites, these relationships more often than not eventually result in a disease state.it is not possible to distinguish the molecular biology of avian viruses from that of non-avian viruses on the basis of features unique to the avian system. however, there are some important distinctions with which viruses must deal. one dramatic difference between birds and mammals is body temperature. on average, birds operate at 3–4°c higher than mammals, and most can readily regulate their temperature, some dropping body temperature as much as 10°c during the night (gill, 1990). while this certainly could influence such things as rates of viral enzyme activity, polymerase fidelity, or protein stability, there are no situations documented in which a particular virus group is restricted to class aves solely on the basis of body temperature.it is possible to distinguish some important receptor-specific distinctions unique to avian systems. one example is found in the influenza type a viruses. the glycosidic linkages associated with sialic acid residues on the avian versus mammalian cell surface serves to restrict the strains of viruses able to replicate. influenza virus hemagglutinin (ha) proteins bind to sialic acid residues on the surface of the host cell. although there is no absolute barrier, those viruses that replicate well in avian cells have a receptor binding pocket on the surface of the ha that has a preference for the α-2,3 siallyl–sugar linkages abundant in bird tissues. those viruses that replicate well in mammalian cells have a preference for α-2,6 linkages more prevalent in mammalian cells (rogers and paulson, 1983; murphy and webster, 1996). there are probably many more receptor specificities associated with other avian virus infections, particularly among the herpesviruses, where host range is narrowly dictated.another example of virus-specified tissue tropism unique to birds would be infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv; genus avibirnavirus), which has “evolved” an affinity for the bursa, a bird-specific organ. the other two known genera of birnaviridae infect fish and invertebrates. since there are as yet no mammalian members, it is tempting to speculate that ibdv is bird specific because of its evolved affinity for the bursa.air sacs are also uniquely avian structures. the bird lung is a fixed tissue incapable of expansion like mammalian lungs. the air sacs are a series of extensions of the respiratory system that expand with the musculature of the body cavity and allow the large-scale rapid oxygen transfer needed for powered flight. the air sac system is extensive throughout the bird, even encroaching into bone tissue; some birds have as many as nine distinct air sacs. many viruses replicate and cause disease in this unique organ system, and there are examples of apparent preferences by some viruses for air sac tissue over other respiratory tissue. finally, feathers, the most notable and prominent distinguishing feature of the class aves, provide a unique niche for at least two three viruses — avipox, marek's disease, and psittacine beak-and-feather disease virus — which can replicate in and are spread from feather follicles (biggs, 1985; tripathy and reed, 1997).as mentioned previously, the immune system of the intact bird is a critical feature in the establishment of ecological relationships between many viruses and hosts. as the immune system plays a major role in the relationships, they will be covered, but there are some extraordinary examples that deserve their own mention. marek's disease, caused by an alphaherpesvirus, is most commonly associated with lymphomas developing relatively early in the life of a chicken. the initial infection in md is a respiratory infection probably initiated in macrophages. a typical field infection would then progress through the following phases in a bird:initial lytic infection => latency => 2nd lytic infection => oncogenesislatency is established primarily in lymphoid cells, and mostly in activated t lymphocytes. in susceptible birds, the latent state progresses to a second round of lytic infections at multiple sites in the bird. interestingly, at this point the feather follicle epithelium is the only site where complete virus replication occurs and becomes a significant source of environmental infectious virus (calnek and witter, 1997). concomitant and permanent immunosuppression occurs in the affected bird. the disease then progresses into a lymphoproliferative phase in susceptible birds that can range in severity depending on the virus strain and breed of chickens. some breeds have shown natural resistance to this progression, and, although the mechanism of resistance is not completely understood, it involves primarily lymphoid tissue and is dictated mostly by genes involved in the immune response (venugopal and payne, 1995). it should be clear from this scenario that the immune system in this host–parasite relationship plays a critical role in the ecology of marek's disease virus.infectious bursal disease virus, as mentioned earlier, is a virus that replicates exclusively in lymphoid tissue. the virus can be detected replicating in the bursa of fabricius and within circulating lymphocytes as early as 4 hours after infection of a chicken. it causes acute degeneration of various lymphoid tissues within the first day of infection and results in a severe, albeit age-dependent, depression in the humoral immune response, being most dramatic in very young birds. interestingly, the infection does not suppress b-cell responses to the viral antigens themselves; in fact, there is stimulation of proliferation of b cells committed to anti-ibdv antibody production (mcferran, 1993). one may only speculate as to what role, if any, this may play in the viral ecology or replicative cycle, but the immune system is once again a major participant in this host–parasite relationship. finally, the effects of vaccination programs on the ecology of avian viruses cannot be overemphasized. in one sense, we have an ongoing experiment where humans control the type of viruses to which certain species of birds are exposed. since live viruses generally yield much better immune responses, they are employed most often. in the case of the single-stranded rna viruses, noted for their ability to rapidly mutate and avoid the immune system, this has the effect of artificially challenging the immune system, creating selection pressure between host and parasite that would not normally occur. this may be effective in the short run, protecting against disease, but the long-term effects are unknown.summarized in table i are some of the most important features of relationships of various viruses with their avian hosts as well as the wide variety of relationships that exist. it is not feasible to list all the interesting attributes for each virus-host relationship, but the table presents a variety of relationships that will be covered in more detail in the following sections. as such, the table should not be taken as the final word on each member virus. for example, in the case of turkey meningoencephalitis virus, a flavivirus, reduced egg production is listed under pathogenesis. reduction in egg production is a common feature in many virus infections of poultry, and while listing it under pathogenesis somewhat stretches the meaning of that word, this clinical sign is one of the most important aspects of that disease in turkeys.although there is variation in the economic or ecological impact of various viral groups from year to year and among geographic sites, the “top ten” list of virus groups exhibiting routine significant impact on commercial poultry worldwide (not necessarily in order of impact) are paramyxoviruses (newcastle disease); coronaviruses (infectious bronchitis); herpesviruses (infectious laryngotracheitis; marek's disease; duck enteritis); reoviruses (viral arthritis); picornaviruses (avian encephalomyelitis); adenoviruses (egg drop syndrome); retroviruses (lymphoid leukosis); orthomyxoviruses (avian influenza); poxviruses (fowlpox); and birnaviruses (infectious bursal disease). the circoviruses (chick anemia) could likely be included in the above list, except it is not yet known to what extent the viral infection alone influences morbidity and mortality (see below).what may not be obvious from table i is that if one searches for viruses in a given avian species one will likely find them. in some of the virus families listed, investigators were forced to clearly separate the disease-causing virus in question from accompanying “contaminant” viruses, which may or may not have influenced the original disease manifestation. there appear to be many viruses of birds that in certain ecological conditions and in certain species may be considered “normal flora” and are not associated with disease. these, obviously, are less interesting to any funding agencies and consequently do not receive much research attention. no one really knows to what extent their transmission and persistence in avian populations affect their own ecology or that of their hosts.the office international des epizooties (oie), the principal world organization for animal health, provides listings of the most serious infectious diseases of animals (oie, 1996) and divides them into two groups: list a diseases, which “includes those diseases that spread rapidly, the scope of which extends beyond national borders” and “have particularly serious socioeconomic or public health consequences”; and list b diseases, which include those “that are considered to be of socioeconomic and/or public health importance within countries.” of the avian viral diseases listed above, only highly pathogenic avian influenza and velogenic newcastle disease are in list a; marek's disease, infectious bursal disease, infectious bronchitis, duck enteritis, and infectious laryngotracheitis are in list b. the only avian disease in oie's list and not on our top 10 list is duck hepatitis, which is a complex of diseases caused by at least three virus families, and generally limited to country-specific origins.the ecological impact of viruses of birds ultimately interests us as homo sapiens, perhaps only to the extent that we are affected. in this respect, there is no question that the major impact thus far has been on raising birds as a food source for our species. ecologically speaking, this impact could have very significant consequences when one considers that poultry provide the most widely used protein source in the world. thus, we will consider for the most part how viruses affect this food source. the most significant and widespread infections of wild birds will be discussed as they are encountered relative to commercial and domestic birds.the most imminent and significant human public health concerns with regard to bird viruses appear to be twofold:1. the potential relationships with type a orthomyxoviruses that have become at least partially adapted in a totally nonpathogenic state to some avian orders. there is compelling evidence that these viruses may also replicate in pigs and re-assort with pig and/or human strains of influenza, yielding new variants capable of replicating and causing disease in humans. they also find their way into commercial poultry, sometimes with devastating consequences. with the recent documented transmission of a lethal avian influenza virus from commercial poultry to humans, these ecological relationships take on new significance.2. the presence of a large reservoir of arboviruses in wild birds, some of which, when transmitted by invertebrate vectors to mammals, cause disease.  beyond these two examples, other relationships are less directly important to human public health. other avian-origin viruses are capable of replicating in and sometimes causing mild disease in humans, but there is obviously not room in one chapter to cover each in detail.infectious laryngotracheitis (ilt) is a respiratory disease almost exclusively of chickens. infections in turkeys and pheasants have been reported, but surveys have yielded no wild bird reservoir or other domestic poultry reservoir (cranshaw and boycott, 1982). based on this and the knowledge that ilt apparently exhibits little antigenic heterogeneity, it has been proposed that through proper husbandry practices and appropriate vaccination techniques the disease could be eliminated from commercial poultry (bagust and johnson, 1998). the virus is a member of the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily and is identified taxonomically as gallid herpesvirus i. the disease is almost exclusively respiratory, with no systemic involvement. the severity of disease can vary from significant mortality (70%) in young birds to an inapparent infection of adult birds. there are age-dependent effects on the pathognomonic signs, and there do appear to be strain-specific virulence differences. however, different isolates do not exhibit sufficient genetic heterogeneity thus far to identify specific virulence factors (bagust and guy, 1997). the most interesting aspect of ilt is its capacity for persistence in infected birds and flocks showing no disease signs. this persistence is most likely due to establishment of the latent state and recrudescence. numerous studies have demonstrated re-isolation of virus many months after initial infection, and one more recent study demonstrated reactivation of latent virus due to stress factors (hughes et al., 1989). this latency achieved by herpesviruses could certainly be considered a unique ecological state, and most herpesvirus infections in birds are associated with its establishment.duck plague, also known as duck viral enteritis (dve), is caused by an alphaherpesvirus classified as anatid herpesvirus-1, which infects free-living and domestic ducks, geese, and swans (sandhu and leibovitz, 1997). the disease is acute and often associated with high morbidity and mortality. the virus has a worldwide distribution and has caused numerous documented outbreaks in free-living anatids. the first documented north american outbreak was in commercial ducks on long island, new york in 1967 (leibovitz and hwang, 1968), and since that time sporadic reappearance of the virus in commercial and wild populations has occurred. major outbreaks in free-living birds along the mississippi flyway and a large epornitic in south dakota in 1973 killed tens of thousands of wild ducks and geese (brand, 1987). vertical transmission and recrudescence of latent virus has been established experimentally in mallard ducks but has not been demonstrated in wild waterfowl. species susceptibility may vary among various waterfowl, although more than 30 species have been shown to be naturally or experimentally infected and virulence differences among dve strains have been demonstrated.the other notable avian herpesvirus infection occurs in pigeons. the virus is taxonomically designated as columbid herpesvirus i and is antigenically indistinguishable from natural isolates taken from wild falcons and owls (vindevogel and duchatel, 1997). the causative virus is antigenically distinct from ilt, mdv, herpesvirus of turkeys (hvt), and the anatid herpesvirus i. the disease associated with infection by columbid herpesvirus i is a major cause of growth retardation and bad performance in homing pigeons, though mortality is generally low. this virus, like ilt, becomes latent, reappears, and is shed in asymptomatic birds and flocks. other antigenically distinct herpesviruses have also been isolated from cormorants, quail, and storks. kaleta (1990) has proposed the division of these various herpes viruses into eight antigenic groups. the host specificity for each group varies, but in general they appear to be strictly adapted to the host of origin (as exemplified by the gallid herpesvirus i). gallid herpesvirus ii and hvt will be discussed in the following section.the impact of transmissible neoplastic diseases of poultry has been quite variable over the years. prior to vaccination, losses to marek's disease were often devastating, and even in marketable flocks condemnations due to lymphomas at processing plants could reach 2%. lymphomas caused by mdv and retroviruses are still the most common viral neoplastic diseases of poultry, and a recent increase in mortality and evolution of more virulent mdv strains indicates that the impact of these viruses will continue to be felt (witter, 1996). marek's disease is caused by a herpesvirus that has two very similar relatives: a second nononcogenic serotype and the herpesvirus of turkeys (hvt). these are sometimes classified as serotypes 1–3, respectively, of the gallid herpesvirus ii strain. they share common antigens that distinguish them from the nononcogenic herpesviruses but can be distinguished on the basis of antigenic differences (calnek and witter, 1997). only the oncogenic mdvs (serotype 1) cause significant problems in commercial poultry. the herpesvirus of turkeys is ubiquitous among commercial flocks and quite prevalent in wild turkeys but has not been directly associated with disease. the serotype 2 strains were originally thought to be nononcogenic apathogenic mdv isolates until they were serologically distinguished from the original isolates. the type 2 serotypes are associated with subclinical infections in chickens, although not as prevalent as turkey strains.the hvt isolate is a very interesting and important isolate, as it was used (and is still used) in vaccine formulations against marek's disease in chicken flocks. it has been very effective at protecting flocks against lymphomas and thus correctly billed as the first anticancer vaccine. marek's disease is relatively well controlled by using mixtures of primarily serotype 2 and 3 isolates in vaccine formulations. however, this vaccination program may ultimately extract a price. shown in figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of the evolution of virulence in mdv strains associated with changing vaccine formulations. the extent to which these formulations have influenced the evolution of virulence is not proven, but certainly the association is undeniable. the 1990s have brought an increase in incidence of marek's disease cases, and the presence of these acutely virulent strains raises concerns for the future. what is clear is the role of humans in the generation of these strains. there is evidence that the commercial housing practices developed in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in generation of strains that were oncogenic and that this rapid evolution of virulence in the last 40 years is probably due to human control of commercial bird populations.the avian retroviruses have one of the most interesting histories of all of the avian viruses. the first transmissible lymphomas were demonstrated in 1908 by ellermann and bang (1908) and the first cell-free transmissible solid tumor by peyton rous three years later (rous, 1911). the etiologic agents of both of these diseases were later shown to be members of what is now known as the avian leukosis virus-avian sarcoma virus complex (alv–asv) of related retroviruses. scientists investigating this interesting group of viruses have garnered more nobel prizes (six) than with any other group. because of their relative simplicity in genetic content and their close association with the genetic character of their host, they have provided a bountiful model for the study of oncogenesis. these are rna-containing viruses that replicate via an intermediate dna stage that is most often incorporated into the host genome. the integrated viral genomes serve as templates for production of new progeny genomic rna molecules and the mrnas needed to make new viral proteins (coffin, 1996). in the process, these viruses transform the host cell into a tumor cell. there is a significant array of viral subtypes and relationships that exist between the host and avian retroviruses and numerous reviews that may be consulted (crittenden, 1981; swanstrom and vogt, 1990). there are several viral subgroups, based on antigenic differences alone, in the surface envelope glycoproteins. viral subtypes have also been grouped on the basis of whether the viruses rapidly induce neoplasia because of the presence of a viral oncogene, or whether they induce slow development of tumors due to their integration into the host genome and subsequent activation of cellular oncogenes. in commercial poultry, the predominant problems are caused by the latter, the slow-inducing lymphoid leukosis viruses (llvs). the sarcoma-, myeloblastosis-, and erythroblastosis-inducing strains cause only sporadic problems. additionally, it has been calculated that losses due to llv because of poultry performance decreases are actually greater than those due to the lymphomas. still, these viruses continue to cause condemnations at slaughter and must be distinguished from the more rapidly forming mdv-induced lymphomas.two other oncogenic avian retroviruses pose significant problems and possess much wider host ranges than the llv–sarcoma complex. the relatively new subgroup “j” has been characterized in europe as causing significant myelocytoma and endothelioma. in contrast to the llvs, subgroup j viruses have a high tropism for cells of the myelomonocytic series but a very low tropism for bursal cells (arshad et al., 1997). a related subgroup j virus has been identified in broiler–breeder flocks in the united states as well (smith et al., 1997). additionally, of note are those retroviruses of the reticuloendotheliosis virus (rev) group. infection with members of this group only rarely results in disease, and then disease most commonly occurs only in the hosts from which rev was first isolated: turkeys. still the rev group is predicted to have significant potential for causing problems in poultry (witter and johnson, 1985), and the wide host range of the virus group has prompted speculation regarding potential as a public health risk. there are, in fact, data demonstrating antibodies to the virus in human and other mammalian sera (johnson et al., 1998).coronaviruses contain a large positive-sense rna genome of approximately 30 kb. members of this virus family infect both mammals and birds (cavanagh et al., 1994). infectious bronchitis, caused by a coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (ibv), is one of the major poultry viral diseases of worldwide economic importance. it is also one of the most rapidly spreading avian respiratory diseases known (mcmartin, 1993). the virus is antigenically variable owing to a high mutation rate in the surface glycoprotein s gene. new antigenic variants of ibv continue to be isolated from various geographic regions. thus far, it has not been possible to determine the number of distinct ibv subtypes, but there are at least six (siddell, 1995). strains can differ in their virulence and tissue tropism, but in general the disease is a rapid-onset respiratory distress that can cause significant mortality in young birds. in established flocks, the infection is often associated with growth retardation and reduction in egg production that may be exacerbated by other respiratory pathogens. estimates of a 10 to 20% loss in market value have been made for a typical outbreak in a flock. vaccination is employed to control the disease, and an interesting related feature is the demonstration that vaccine strains can undergo recombination with wild-type strains. consequently, new ibv antigenic variants of the s1 gene emerge with characteristics of both viruses (cavanagh et al., 1992; wang et al., 1993). ibv is also an excellent example of a virus exquisitely adapted to its host, as it is not found naturally in any other reservoir. chickens seem to be the only reservoir, and the virus is capable of persisting in some manner within populations and later being transmitted to naive flocks. evidence suggests the mode is primarily airborne transmission. in controlled studies, birds in houses 115 feet away from an experimentally “seeded” house were infected via aerosol transmission (mcmartin, 1993), and circumstantial data from natural outbreaks suggest transmission over distances of several hundred yards (cumming, 1970).coronaviral enteritis of turkeys, also known as bluecomb disease, may also be species specific since chickens, pheasants, and quail do not exhibit any disease following inoculation with a strain of virus that is virulent for turkeys (hofstad et al., 1970; larsen, 1979). coronaviruses have been isolated from ratites with enteric disease in zoological collections, but the relationship of these isolates with the turkey coronavirus (tcv) has not been investigated (frank and carpenter, 1992; kennedy and brenneman, 1995). transmission of tcv appears to be restricted to the fecal-oral route, although cell-free lysates of the bursa from infected birds can be used to transmit the agent orally. among turkey flocks, the primary mode of transmission of coronaviral enteritis is via contaminated personnel and equipment. however, since tcv is excreted in fecal material and is very stable, it is conceivable that wild birds may serve as vectors for the agent. morbidity is usually as high as 100%, with mortality becoming as high as 50% in an infected turkey flock. mortality among poults may be much higher with increased numbers of secondary bacterial gastrointestinal infections contributing to severity of disease.turkey coronavirus also shares features reported for mammalian hemagglutinating coronaviruses and is closely related by sequence and antigenic crossreactivity to bovine coronavirus and a human coronavirus isolate (verbeek and tijssen, 1991). this close relationship suggests recent interspecies transmission of the coronaviruses. while no etiologic agent has been pinpointed, a bovine origin coronavirus has been implicated in an emerging enteric disease of turkeys called poult enteritis mortality syndrome (pems) (barnes and guy, 1997).the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) present a unique challenge to evaluating ecological virus–host relationships. this grouping includes members from several virus families, six of which have members isolated from birds: togaviridae, flaviviridae, reoviridae, arenoviridae, bunyaviridae, and rhabdoviridae. of these, only the togaviridae and flaviviridae have strains that have caused documented disease in commercial poultry and game birds. although difficult to assess in feral populations, isolates from the remaining virus families as well as several isolates from the togaviridae and flaviviridae are not associated with any pathology in birds.of the togaviridae, the genus alphavirus contains the encephalitic strains causing eastern equine encephalitis (eee), western equine encephalitis (wee), and a closely related wild bird isolate — the highlands j virus (hjv). pheasants have been the primary targets of significant outbreaks of eee. signs of infection are primarily but not exclusively neural, and mortality rates have reached 80% in some natural outbreaks (ficken et al., 1993; eleazer and hill, 1994). economically significant outbreaks of disease due to eee virus in turkeys have occurred in wisconsin, with severity of the disease decreasing with increasing bird age. significant outbreaks have also been recorded in chukar partridges, ducks, and chickens. wee has been only rarely associated with disease in avian species, and the closely related hj virus appears to be the eastern united states equivalent to wee. hjv has caused severe neuropathogenic outbreaks in chukar partridges and has been associated with infections in turkey flocks resulting in acute reduction in egg production (wages et al., 1993). of course, these encephalitic viruses also cause disease in humans and horses.another interesting alphavirus, ockelbo virus, related to sindbis virus, has been implicated in causing arthralgia and rash in humans following its isolation from mosquitos collected during the outbreak. these viruses are transmitted by mosquitos among bird populations, which may act as the vector for transmission between humans and avian species. ockelbo virus, therefore, is apparently maintained in an enzootic cycle involving birds and mosquitos with transmission to other hosts such as humans. antibodies to ockelbo virus, either experimentally or naturally infected, have been detected in passeriformes, galliformes, and anseriformes (lundstrom et al., 1992; lundstrom and niklasson, 1996). viremia in the absence of disease resulting from infection with ockelbo has also been demonstrated in these bird groups. given the widespread occurrence of antibodies to these encephalitic alphaviruses, it seems logical to conclude that birds in many cases act as “natural” and reservoir hosts. the only flavivirus thus far associated with disease in birds is the israel turkey meningoencephalitis virus. infected birds exhibit neurological dysfunction and occasional significant mortality. this virus has also been identified in turkeys in south africa.double-stranded segmented rna viruses are unique and intriguing. the distinguished virologist dr. wolfgang k. joklik, when asked what in the world he thought they meant in the grand scheme of biology, replied (and i paraphrase), “they represent an evolutionary step forward in the establishment of the ideal genetic material.” the reoviruses have fascinated virologists for some time. they have an unusual and complex replication strategy, are able to undergo reassortment of their genes, and are curious in that they retain their infecting subviral cores as their rna replication template. reoviruses are also quite stable outside the host, remaining viable for up to a year at room temperature (nibert et al., 1996). the mammalian strains have a wide host range but are found without any associated clinical signs, the origin of the name reo (respiratory and enteric orphan) telling most of the story. in poultry, several antigenic subtypes have been identified, and the virus can be classified based on serotyping and virulence, but there is no unified typing scheme as yet (kawamura and tsubahara, 1960; robertson and wilcox, 1986). the most severe and common pathology associated with reoviruses is arthritis–tenosynovitis, although associations with other clinical syndromes including respiratory and enteric disorders have been described (rosenberger and olson, 1997). often, the clinical states are influenced by the presence of other pathogens. arthritis is a significant problem in birds but primarily only in young chicks and turkey poults. other reoviridae in birds include several members of the genera orbivirus (arboviruses; see below) and rotavirus, which have been associated with a runting–stunting syndrome in chickens.the birnaviridae are a relatively recently characterized family of viruses that contain two double-stranded segments of rna and have no mammalian members thus far (ictv, 1995). they were difficult to classify for many years because of their cell-associated nature and slow replication in cell culture systems. currently, two serotypes (1 and 2) are accepted, with significant antigenic variation and numerous proposed subtypes within each serotype (mcferran et al., 1980; jackwood and saif, 1987). chickens are the only animals known to develop disease and lesions when naturally infected by avibirnaviruses. both serotypes are distributed worldwide, but serotype 1 strains are the only ones associated with pathogenicity and immunosuppression. the bursa is the primary target organ, and strains of differing virulence have been identified. the disease is most significantly manifested when young birds are infected and permanent immunosuppression results. this sets the stage for subsequent severe viral and bacterial infections later in life. interestingly, ibd is an example where maternal antibodies derived by either vaccinations or natural infections provide significant immune protection. highly virulent strains of these viruses exist in various countries worldwide, and there are indications that new virulent variants do arise in the face of immune pressure (chettle et al., 1989b).avian adenoviruses are double-stranded dna viruses containing 30–10 genes. these viruses can be loosely divided into three groups based on antigenic relationships of internal proteins (mcferran, 1997), although the three groups have not been officially recognized by the ictv. the avian group i adenoviruses include at least 12 serologically distinct types, all of which have been isolated from mildly or asymptomatic poultry. the type species is known as the celo (chick embryo lethal orphan), or phelps strain, or f1 (fowl) strain. there are also numerous isolates from other avian species plus electron microscopy and immunological evidence that the type i aviadenoviruses are widely distributed in birds. by themselves, these viruses present no particular clinical problems in commercial poultry, but they are thought to cause significant problems in mixed infections with immunosuppressive viruses such as ibdv and chick infectious anemia virus (ciav). a virus virtually indistinguishable from the celo strain known as quail bronchitis virus (qbv) can be devastating in commercial quail operations, causing as high as 80% mortality (dubose and grumbles, 1959; montreal, 1992). virus isolations and significant antibody levels in wild quail suggest that the virus may present disease problems in nature (king et al., 1981), although there are no documented cases or epizootics.the group ii aviadenoviruses include turkey hemorrhagic enteritis virus (hev), pheasant marble spleen disease virus (msdv), and the avian adenovirus splenomegaly (aas) of chickens. these three agents are serologically indistinguishable but induce differing clinical manifestations in the different species. infections caused by this virus group appear to target lymphoid tissue, often resulting in immunosuppression, and there are strain-specific differences in virulence among the various group ii isolates (pierson and domermuth, 1997). hev reached epidemic proportions in the 1960s and still causes significant problems in turkey-producing states in the united states and elsewhere. msdv is a significant pathogen in confinement pheasant operations, causing significant economic losses. aas is virtually ubiquitous among chicken flocks in the united states, in which case mild respiratory signs and splenomegaly are occasionally associated. the syndrome is similar to the disease state observed in pheasants, but in general aas virus causes no significant problems among chickens. evidence indicates that these group ii avian adenoviruses are limited to the order galliformes, and that wild bird populations (even wild turkeys) are unaffected.the more interesting group iii adenoviruses first appeared in 1976 associated with a distinct clinical manifestation called egg drop syndrome (eds), in which egg production decreases and thin-shelled or shell-less eggs are produced. the disease has caused significant egg production losses mostly in the eurasian and australian-pacific poultry markets. a virus named eds76, which has been found associated with this syndrome, may have been originally introduced via a contaminated vaccine, but it seems clear now that sporadic cases are initiated by introduction of the causative virus from domestic and wild waterfowl, mostly ducks and geese. when endemic in flocks, the virus is transmitted vertically and exhibits a latent phase, which is reactivated in laying hens, usually after egg production begins. the virus initially appears to replicate in lymphoid tissues but rapidly moves to the oviduct, where replication causes inflammation and production of aberrant eggs. unlike other avian adenoviruses, the group iii strains do not replicate in the intestinal mucosa. it is likely that eds76 virus or very similar strains are present ubiquitously in wild ducks and geese, but rarely appear to be associated with disease (mcferran, 1997).the avipoxviruses are widely distributed throughout the class aves, having been isolated from some 60 species representing 20 avian taxonomic families. the avipoxviruses are responsible for economically important disease problems in commercial poultry and aviaries (tripathy, 1993). they may cause a slowly developing cutaneous disease with low mortality or, conversely, significant mortality, and generalized infections when in the diphtheritic form on mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and associated areas. these large dna viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell, where they form characteristic inclusion bodies within rapidly proliferating nodular lesions. the poxviruses may be transmitted by mechanical means such as introduction from poultry workers into abrasions in the skin of uninfected poultry. there is also real evidence for transmission of the disease by mosquitos and other vectors such as mites in close conditions, where the number of diseased birds is high. the avipoxviruses can also apparently establish a latent state and be naturally or chemically induced to reactivate (kirmse, 1967b). cutaneous lesions containing infectious virus persistent for more than a year have also been documented in wild birds (kirmse, 1967a). variant strains of avipoxviruses have since been isolated from previously vaccinated flocks that were experiencing significant mortality from the diphtheritic form of the disease (tripathy and reed, 1997). this suggests that, similar to marek's disease, vaccination against poxviruses may ultimately lead to escape of more virulent forms of the viruses. the avipoxviruses are also considered one of the most promising dna virus vectors for delivery of recombinant poultry vaccines, and poxvirus-vectored vaccines against newcastle disease and avian influenza have been licensed.avian encephalomyelitis is primarily a disease of young chicks caused by a picornavirus. the disease was quite economically important prior to initiation of live-virus vaccination. the host range is very limited (order galliformes), and there is only one virus serotype. the natural isolate is enterotropic and is transmitted horizontally (orally) and vertically. there is a gradient of pathology dependent on the age of infection of young chicks. pre-immune chicks from non-immune parents will generally die if infected within 1 to 2 days of hatch. if infected between 2 and 8 days of age, they may live but exhibit significant nervous involvement (encephalomyelitis). if infected beyond that age, they may exhibit enteric pathology but not neural signs. at adulthood or full immunocompetence, they may be infected but refractory to any clinical signs. so the immune status of the host in this case is very important in affecting the course of the viral replication (calnek, 1997).another avian picornavirus, distinct from aev, is the avian nephritis virus (shirai et al., 1991). this virus is similar to aev in that it is primarily a problem in very young birds and has a very limited host range. as the name implies, a distinct clinical syndrome is associated with the agents, but it is has not yet been determined how extensive infections are in commercial poultry. finally, another picornavirus, duck hepatitis 1 (dhv-1), has caused significant problems in commercial duck operations. there are still unknowns with regard to the overall importance of dhv-1, and there are additional virus-induced types of hepatitis disease with at least two others often encountered.the most significant cost involved in raising birds for food sources is feeding them. consequently, diseases that affect the feed-protein conversion ratio will directly affect the cost of marketable birds. as such, enteric disease, even when nonlethal or mild in nature, can affect the performance of food-source birds. in recent years, investigators have identified rotaviruses in chickens, astroviruses in turkeys, and enterovirus-like particles in several avian species associated with enteric diseases. many of these have been associated with significant pathogenesis, particularly in mixed infections where immunosuppression occurs, with subsequent decrease in marketability due to weight loss (barnes, 1997).the virus designated chicken infectious anemia virus (ciav) is a single-stranded circular dna-containing virus, tentatively classified with two similar agents in a new family: circoviridae. the agent has only recently been recognized, purified, and characterized, and its unequivocal role in economically important disease is not yet fully established. purified virus inoculated into young chicks results in severe anemia and immunosuppression, but inoculation of 2- to 3-week old birds results in little if any pathology (yuasa and imai, 1986). the virus has been associated with adult anemic conditions, however, in conjunction with other viral and bacterial infections and may thus play a significant role. the agent is widespread in commercial poultry flocks worldwide, and infection with the virus has been statistically related to a decrease in overall growth and performance (chettle et al., 1989a). the extent to which two other tentative members of the family circoviridae — psittacine beak-and-feather disease virus (bfdv) and porcine circovirus — are related to ciav is under question, and these stated taxonomic relationships may differ in the future. bfdv has proven to be a significant pathogen in aviaries and commercial in psittacine birds to the extent that vaccines are now routinely administered. recent evidence also suggests that circovirus particles can be detected by em and isolated from several other wild and captive bird species. consequently, the circoviridae may emerge as a more significant disease-causing agent in the near future.the caliciviridae is a family of small single-strand positive-sense rna viruses with a polyadenylated genome. virus-like particles resembling caliciviruses have been isolated from a variety of wild-bird and captive-raised species. a chicken calicivirus has been replicated in cell culture and caused apparent gastrointestinal disease in specific pathogen-free day-old chicks (cubitt and barrett, 1985). intestinal contents of goldfinches with hemorrhagic enteritis have been found to contain calicivirus-like particles and gastrointestinal disease associated with caliciviruses has been reported in guinea fowl and pheasants (gough et al., 1985). caliciviruses were originally isolated from marine mammals and have caused disease in both domestic and feral swine due to consumption of uncooked garbage containing seafood. interestingly, caliciviruses have been detected in pelagic birds, such as the white tern (poet et al., 1994). calicivirus isolations such as these lead to the speculation that wild sea birds may be important in the transmission of these agents across large areas or to other animals.parvoviruses are the smallest of the dna-containing viruses, carrying a single-stranded genome of about 5000 nucleotides. they cause or are associated with three infections in birds (kisary, 1993). in wild and domestic geese and muscovy ducks, derzy's disease refers to a syndrome that had been variously called goose influenza, goose hepatitis, gosling enteritis, and infectious myocarditis in different countries. this collection of names gives some indication of the variety of signs associated with derzy's disease. the virus, which can be transmitted horizontally and vertically, induces differing pathologies depending on the age of the bird and, in the case of hatchlings, the level of maternal antibodies. an interesting pathology often associated with infection of older birds is the virtually complete loss of feathers. the extreme stability of the parvoviruses makes control of this disease difficult in commercial operations worldwide, and the disease can result in 100% mortality in young hatchlings.in chickens and young turkeys, parvoviruses have been associated with runting stunting syndrome (rss), as have other agents. experimental inoculations have indicated that the associated viruses, which are distinct from the goose viruses, can cause significant pathology, but the extent to which these viruses participate in the rss is not yet established (trampel et al., 1983; decaesstecker et al., 1986). another parvovirus, the avian adeno-associated virus is almost always found associated with adenovirus infections in poultry. the avian adeno-associated viruses are grouped with their mammalian counterparts in the dependovirus genus, although they are serologically unrelated. the avian dependovirus appears to contribute to disease only in the sense that it can affect multiplication of the associated adenoviruses (yates and piela, 1993).newcastle disease virus (ndv), classified as avian paramyxovirus-1, contains a single-strand negative-sense rna genome of 15 kb containing coding sequences for six genes. the virus infects all bird species tested to date, including free-living and domestic species. one panzootic outbreak of the disease is thought to have originated in asia, with subsequent spread to europe, with outbreaks of disease first reported in poultry during the 1920s in java, indonesia, and newcastle-upon-tyne, england. worldwide dissemination of the disease, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, has been attributed to increased international trade of both commercial poultry and pet birds. this led to development of inactivated and live-virus vaccines for commercial poultry. the transmission of infectious ndv may occur by either ingestion or inhalation, and this knowledge is the basis for mass-application vaccination procedures during poultry production.isolates of ndv are grouped into three main pathotypes depending on the severity of disease that they cause (alexander and parsons, 1974). mildly virulent “lentogenic” viruses may cause unnoticeable infections in adult chickens or a mild respiratory distress and are used extensively as live-virus vaccines. “mesogenic” ndvs are of intermediate virulence and cause respiratory distress, with mild infections of various organs detectable only by histopathology. highly virulent viruses that cause severe morbidity and mortality are termed “velogenic.” velogenic viruses can manifest themselves as neurotropic or viscerotropic forms of newcastle disease with extensive systemic replication throughout a bird. virulent forms of ndv can replicate within cultures of most avian and mammalian cell types without the addition of trypsin, while lentogens require added proteases for replication in cell culture. the presence of dibasic amino acids at the proteolytic cleavage site (pcs) of the viral fusion protein and the ability of cellular proteases to cleave the fusion protein of various pathotypes specify the molecular basis for ndv virulence. fewer basic amino acids are present in the fusion protein cleavage site of lentogenic ndv than is the case for mesogenic or velogenic isolates. the presence of the increased number of dibasic amino acids in the fusion protein pcs sequence of ndv allows for systemic replication of these more pathogenic viruses in the host (nagai et al., 1976).although the principal concern with ndv is its effect on poultry production, it may have severe consequences in other free-living avian species. major outbreaks of newcastle disease have occurred in north american cormorants during the summers of 1990 and 1992, and again in 1997. outbreaks during 1990 and 1992 occurred in the north central united states and south central canada, while in 1997 newcastle disease occurred among cormorants of the western united states and canada. mortality in young nestlings in some areas was as high as 80 to 90%, and the affected birds had characteristic neurotropic lesions (heckert et al., 1996). during the 1992 outbreak in cormorants, an unvaccinated north dakota turkey flock became infected with ndv, resulting in high mortality. using nucleotide sequence analysis, the virus causing disease in turkeys was proven to be the same virus isolated from afflicted cormorants in the central united states and canada. the cormorant virus was also phylogenetically related to other known ndv isolates of psittacine origin (seal et al., 1995) that had caused a major outbreak in southern california poultry during the early 1970s that resulted in a depopulation of two million chickens (utterback and schwartz, 1973).illegal importation of pet bird species into the united states continues to be a source of highly virulent ndv and certainly may play a role in spread of viruses that threaten commercial poultry worldwide (panigrahy et al., 1993). what role free-living birds play in spread of ndv is unclear. although persistent infections of chickens by ndv do not appear to occur, the virus’ persistence in poultry flocks may result from virus reintroduced from wild populations. also, different bird species vary in their level of susceptibility to ndv. ducks, geese, and certain psittacine birds do not exhibit signs of disease when infected with highly virulent ndv, while other psittacine species may have high mortality. persistent infections have been demonstrated in various psittacine birds, with virus isolations noted up to a year following experimental infection of parrots with velogenic ndv chicken isolates (erickson et al., 1978). although psittacine birds have been directly linked as a source of ndv highly virulent for gallinaceous birds, such as chickens and pheasants, no studies have shown direct isolation of ndv from feral psittacines.newcastle disease occurred in racing and show pigeons during the 1980s in both western europe and north america. the outbreaks in western europe were linked to contaminated feed, and disease was controlled in both areas via vaccination with mildly virulent ndv commonly used for poultry. the virus isolated from these birds varied somewhat from traditionally virulent ndv in having only one set of dibasic amino acids in the fusion protein cleavage site. increased virulence for poultry subsequently occurred only after passage in chickens (collins et al., 1994). these examples demonstrate the fact that variant forms of ndv may arise in different bird species and that free-living birds may be a constant source of viruses that affect both domestic and wild birds.vaccination programs against ndv for the most part have been effective al controlling the virus in commercial poultry. however, all of the vaccine strains available today, while effective against lethal disease, share less sequence identity with currently circulating disease strains. this is effectively illustrated in figure 2 , which may also be considered a useful example for other rna-containing viruses. the phylogenetic tree demonstrates the relationship between current strains and the vaccine strains based on the sequence of the fusion protein. it shows that vaccine strains are relatively far removed from the recent isolates coming from wild birds. the future consequences of such heterologous vaccination approaches are unknown. the same scenario might unfold for ndv, as has occurred in the attempt to control marek's disease where the immune status of vaccinated flocks promotes generation of novel antigenic variants with new virulence characteristics.avian influenza (ai) presents one of the most interesting ecological relationships between birds and their viruses. its ecology has been reviewed in depth (webster et al., 1992; hinshaw et al., 1980), but ai presents such a complete picture of a virus with multiple impacts on several species that it must be included in this chapter. the type a orthomyxoviruses are essentially bird viruses. the infections in birds can range from clinically inapparent with minimal serologic response, to a devastating systemic disease that can result in 100% mortality within a matter of days. there are 15 identified subtypes of ai viruses based on the hemagglutinin (ha) protein antigenic structure and nine subtypes based on the neuraminidase (na) structure. these two genes code for the predominant surface glycoproteins, which are embedded in the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope. these are only 2 of 10 genes coded for by the virus. the virus’ genetic material is contained on eight separate negative-sensed single-stranded rna segments ranging from 890 to 2450 nucleotides in length.all of the ha and na viral subtypes have been identified in feral waterbirds, and it has been proposed that these birds act as a “natural” reservoir for the virus (webster et al., 1992; slemons and easterday, 1977). determination of the phylogenetic relationships of several genes from several subtypes of aiv collected from wild birds indicated that the general rate of evolution in the avian reservoir is low compared to the rate of evolution observed in human and other mammalian strains of type a orthomyxoviruses (gorman et al., 1992). other recent studies, however, have shown that the mutation rate of the ha gene and the ns gene even in wild birds approaches that seen in human strains (garcia et al., 1997; suarez and perdue et al., 1998).s measurement of clinical signs among infected migrating waterbirds is, of course, a difficult task. thus far, only a single instance of severe clinical signs has been associated with free-living birds — a lethal outbreak in terns in south africa in 1961 caused by an h5n1 strain (becker, 1966). given the recently measured mutation rates, and the appearance of this severe lethality in a wild bird population, it must be considered that aivs do continue to evolve in feral birds (indeed 15 subtypes have arisen already!). there is no reason to believe that the present count of 15 subtypes will be the final tally.while some have proposed that the aiv strain in wild birds causes no disease problems as a result of “evolutionary stasis,” without question the virus has dramatic effects when it leaves this proposed reservoir. in addition to the fixed influenza populations in pigs and horses, avian strains can directly infect mammals and have been identified in whales, seals, and mink (lang et al., 1981; berg et al., 1990). the dramatic association with seals in 1980 and 1982 mentioned earlier clearly points out the potential impact of aivs. this avian reservoir then serves as a sort of base for the viral “biological invasions” that are a part of interspecies transmission. ecologically and economically, the transmission of these aiv subtypes to commercial poultry has perhaps yielded the most important impact. the situation is most clearly played out in minnesota each year. due to the large number of lakes in the state, migratory waterfowl, primarily anseriformes (ducks, geese), frequent the area in large numbers seasonably. nearby commercial turkey operations suffer infections nearly every year, particularly in the cooler fall months, caused by different influenza subtypes of different virulence (halvorson et al., 1985). in severe years, the associated costs due to turkey mortality, as well as performance and egg production losses, can reach several millions of dollars (poss and halvorson, 1986).in chickens, introduction of influenza viruses from waterfowl has been more devastating. in the northeastern united states, the h5 subtype caused the first large-scale outbreak of highly pathogenic ai in numerous flocks in 1983. twenty-three million birds were destroyed at a cost of more than $65,000,000 in order to contain the infection. clinically, the disease was indistinguishable from the disease originally described as “fowl plague” in 1927 in europe (eckroade and silverman, 1986). today we know that all of the classical “fowl plague”-type outbreaks have been associated exclusively with only two subtypes: h5 and h7. evolution to virulence in these subtypes has been closely associated with accumulation of basic amino acids at the proteolytic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein (bosch et al., 1981; webster and rott, 1987). in order for aiv strains to be infectious, the ha protein must be cleaved into ha1 and ha2 subunits, which subsequently allows structural rearrangement and exposure of a protein sequence needed to fuse the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the target cell (klenk et al., 1975; skehel et al., 1995). isolates of low pathogenicity lack multiple basic amino acids and are only cleaved by trypsin-like extracellular proteases. these proteases are abundant on the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract and gut, so the viruses replicate unrestricted at these sites. the highly pathogenic (hp) forms, however, have additional basic amino acids, which are recognized by the intracellular furin-like proteases ubiquitous in bird tissues (rott et al., 1995). thus, in birds, these viruses are able to escape the respiratory tract and infect a wider variety of internal tissues and organs. this is one of the most important of the virulence factors (webster and rott, 1987). only two subtypes have been shown to accumulate these basic amino acids: h7 and h5. these subtypes appear to do so by either base substitution or by insertion events (wood et al., 1993; perdue et al., 1997). nucleotide insertion events appear to be the most common mechanism, and table ii and figure 3 illustrate what is presently known about occurrence of these hp virus isolates in commercial poultry. the hp isolates, with only two exceptions, have additional inserted basic amino acids within the well-conserved region surrounding the cleavage site. from the data in table ii and figure 3, it may be easily surmised that both the number of hp isolates and the number of basic amino acids at the cleavage site are increasing. the avian influenza viruses are distributed worldwide. in addition to the united states, outbreaks of highly pathogenic ai have occurred in mexico, canada, europe, asia, and australia. in most cases, there is some sort of connection between the affected flocks and nearby waterfowl. the extent to which the reservoir of viruses exists in waterfowl is not really known. surveys have shown that, in addition to the viruses being widespread, the various subtypes increase and decrease in prevalence over successive years. the order charadriiformes (shorebirds and allies), in addition to anseriiformes, has been shown to carry aiv strains (kawaoka et al., 1988), and the extent to which aivs are carried in other orders has really only been superficially explored. molecular and phylogenetic evidence have clearly shown that these segmented viruses share various genes back and forth within the populations of circulating virus strains (garcia et al., 1997). they are also capable of donating genes through genetic reassortment to viruses in swine and those genes ultimately end up in humans (webster et al., 1993). add this capacity to the known (albeit rare) transmission of purely avian influenza strains directly into mammals and one creates a potential ecological bonanza for the virus, and potential nightmares for new hosts.as advanced as our study of viruses has become, there are still a variety of unknowns with regard to the extent to which avian viruses infect other vertebrates. it would not be unreasonable to suggest that, because of their mobility and longevity of existence, that the class aves may have played a critical role in distribution of viruses to other classes. in the case of the avian orthomyxoviruses, phylogenetic evidence points to recent introduction of these viruses from birds to mammals. following introduction, the natural mutation and evolution of the virus produced strains that now appear to be adapted to their new hosts. there are swine, equine, and human strains of type a influenza viruses that do not replicate well outside their respective host species. if birds are indeed responsible for us coming down with the flu today, we know of no reason why they might not have participated over the eons in the establishment of other purely mammalian diseases. of course, one could easily argue the opposite relationship, but, intuitively, birds do present an ideal mobile vector, particularly for the enterically transmitted viruses.in addition to the diseases discussed here, there is a growing group of emerging diseases or diseases of as yet unknown etiology in commercial poultry (saif, 1997). many of them have virus particles clearly associated with the syndrome, but only limited research and characterization has been carried out thus far. it is probably safe to assume that the future will continue to bring new avian diseases and bring to light new or undiscovered avian viruses.the relationships existing among birds, insects, and viruses is one area that should be explored in more detail by increased research efforts. in free-living birds, the large number of apparently innocuous infections with bunyaviridae, togaviridae, and flaviviridae suggest that birds may act as an ecological reservoir for maintenance of these virus populations. from a virocentric point of view (if there is such a thing), having a potentially highly mobile population of susceptible hosts on which transmission vectors may feed would be advantageous. it would provide a mechanism by which to transfer viruses over large geographical distances where they could then be transmitted by new related or unrelated vectors, thus increasing host range. of course, one runs the risk here of assuming that the virus would be ecologically improved by extending its replicative capacity in new hosts. this may not be a valid assumption. for example, if variola virus or human poliovirus type 1 had been exploiting this strategy, they made a bad choice in extending their host range into humans!from one human vantage point, birds provide a useful monitor for detection of arboviral diseases in a given area. sentinel chickens are actually in use today along the east coast of the united states to gauge the extent to which some mosquito populations are carrying eastern equine encephalitis and st. louis encephalitis viruses. the future is perhaps the most important aspect to consider. what viruses other than the orthomyxoviruses may someday establish a similar relationship where transmission to a mammalian intermediate or even direct transmission may allow introduction into the human population?one fundamental unanswered question is whether birds, acting as reservoirs for arboviruses, should be considered an important ecological niche for those viruses. there is no evidence of which we are aware to indicate either yes or no. there have been no documented transmissions of arboviruses from birds to mammals without the insect vector in nature, however, so at this point wild birds could be considered dead-end hosts for the arboviruses. in commercial poultry during outbreaks of the alphavirus eeev, there is no evidence of infection of workers in close contact with infected birds. if, however, a bird provides the necessary reservoir of eeev that infected the human, then this bird becomes very important. but there are no data that as yet identify the bird as the required reservoir for disease transmission to human.newcastle disease virus provides an interesting new disease problem in humans that has only arisen as a result of increased vaccination of birds. a live-virus vaccine is available for control of ndv that is administered by aerosol spray. in a small number of cases where precautions have not been taken, vaccinators can contract a conjunctivitis caused by the vaccine. this outcome has been seen in the heavy poultry-producing areas of northern georgia, on a common enough basis now, to be easily recognized by ophthalmologists. there is usually no seroconversion to the virus in these cases, and they are not particularly serious infections. there is also suggestive evidence in the form of measured seroconversion that poultry workers occasionally may be subclinically infected with avian coronaviruses and avian retroviruses.the evidence for direct infection of humans with avian influenza viruses is growing. human strains have classically included only three subtypes (h1–3). until recently, the only other strains shown to cause disease in humans were of the h7 subtype. conjunctivitis caused by purely avian h7 subtype viruses has been reported on two occasions (kurtz et al., 1996; webster et al., 1981a). the most disturbing set of events, however, was the more recent highly publicized influenza outbreak in hong kong. a purely avian h5 subtype virus was isolated from some 18 patients, 6 of whom died, from may through december of 1997. the index case, a 3-year-old child, in may followed a highly pathogenic outbreak of avian influenza that had just previously occurred in chickens in hong kong and its environs. the child had been exposed to ill birds at a day care center, and it was clear that the recovered virus was essentially the same as that recovered during the chicken outbreak. considerable efforts were made to determine whether the virus was a contaminant and whether it was replicating in the child. the evidence strongly suggested that it was indeed replicating (subbarao et al., 1998). subsequent to this event, in november–december the remaining confirmed cases were reported and an intense effort was mounted to determine exactly how this virus was transmitted. it is clear now that the h5n1 viruses infecting humans in hong kong 1997 were all of avian origin (suarez et al., 1998). there is limited serologic suggestion of human-to-human transmission but no genetic evidence of adaptation to humans. this case was touted as a premier test run for the next predicted influenza pandemic. whether this outbreak represents a simple dead-end zoonotic transmission or whether these purely avian influenza viruses can become fixed in the human population is a matter for conjecture. the avian h5 and h7 influenza strains have been the only natural influenza strains thus far to unequivocally cause systemic lethal infection in any species owing to the unique structure of their ha protein (see fig. 3). a major fear is that by adding such ha subtypes to a population of mammalian viruses a whole new class of virulent strains might be created. our experience in working with numerous highly pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains has been one of very little or no evidence for human infection in the 25 years that scientists and technicians have spent working with hundreds of different stains. but our experience has also been that, when one attempts to confine influenza viruses by setting biological rules for them, they usually find a way to break them.if ecology is the study of the relationship of organisms to their environment, for bird viruses, the active, pertinent, environment is always within the bird and its tissues. while one cannot discount the effects of the environment outside the host, there are no positive effects on an avian virus life cycle outside the host of which we are aware. that is, there are no activation events outside the avian host of which we are aware; only events of inactivation. certainly, avian viruses, as all viruses, have evolved survival strategies to allow passage from host to host, and some are much more refractory to environmental inactivation than others. but without really knowing which, if any, “evolutionary direction” viruses are taking, it is impossible to determine whether a large herpesvirus of 150 genes is ecologically more fit than the enterovirus with five genes!the relationship of birds and insects in the transmission and life cycle of the arboviruses is poorly understood. until this recent transmission of h5n1 influenza strains to humans, this relationship appeared to be the only significant one in which there is interaction among a genetically unaltered virus, an avian host, and a non-avian host. as mentioned earlier, other documented cases of avian-to-mammalian viral transmission are newcastle disease infections of humans and influenza a infections of mammals and humans. there is also serological evidence for avian retrovirus and avian coronavirus infections. in the case of newcastle disease, the documented infections are mostly minor conjunctivitis. in the case of influenza, discussed earlier, the avian viruses most often acquire rna segments from other sources before they are established in a new host. thus, in general, the impact of avian viruses on public health might currently be considered small, but clearly the potential exists for significant future impact.a major interesting question arises when evaluating virulence of avian-origin viruses. conventional wisdom seems to be suggesting that virus entry into naive host populations is more likely to result in a general decrease in virulence as the virus adapts to the new host (morse, 1994). this may be true under truly “natural” conditions; but what happens under human-dictated conditions such as vaccination and by defining the host population through breeding and housing? in the case of marek's disease, we see an example of virulence increasing in the face of continued vaccination against the virus (fig. 1). whether this is occurring as a result of the vaccination or a combination of factors, the fact is that the population of marek's disease herpesviruses in nature is becoming more virulent. the vaccination programs for newcastle disease utilize vaccines whose genetic compositions are becoming farther and farther removed from the virulent strains circulating in wild fowl (fig. 2). this may not bode well for future control of virulent strains in commercial poultry.in the case of avian influenza viruses, we have seen the number of highly virulent outbreaks increase in recent years, often following prior circulation of a nonpathogenic precursor, and we have seen concomitant changes in genetic structure related to virulence (fig. 3). again there are unknowns in this system, but the fact remains that we are seeing more virulence as the nonpathogenic aiv subtypes replicate in commercial poultry settings. thus, this naive commercial population, unlike the waterfowl hosts to which the virus has adapted, appears to allow generation of heretofore unencountered virulence phenotypes. similar scenarios appear to be playing out as more virulent infectious bronchitis strains and infectious bursal disease strains appear worldwide. one must be cautious, then, in working strictly under the previously mentioned virulence-decrease paradigms for mammalian viruses. these have been suggested mostly by the experiences with artificial introduction of rabbit papilloma viruses in australia or where new introductions occur as human encroachment ensues (such as in the recent cases of ebola virus or monkey poxvirus infections). in these cases, it was proposed that virus transmission results first in high virulence for the host followed by subsequent adaptation and attenuation.finally, it may be dangerous to attempt to confine avian viruses to some of our more “logical” inferences based on darwinian evolution. one paraphrased definition of evolution is “moving from a prior more primitive (or less fit) state to a current more advanced (or more fit) state.” it is difficult, for us at least, to say that any avian viruses are following such a progression. additionally, other than use as molecular biological vectors, viruses in general have not been shown to provide anything positive to the ecology of any other organisms. the future may yet reveal such relationships, but, for now, ridding ourselves of these fascinating parasites by continuing such policies as those resulting in the eradication of smallpox and polio still appears to be our most prudent course.sars-cov-2 is the causative agent of current pandemic of novel coronavirus disease which has infected millions of people and is responsible for more than 200,000 deaths worldwide in a span of just 4 months. the virus has a positive sense, singlestranded rna genome, which is around 30 kb in length. the genome codes for four structural and multiple non-structural proteins (astuti and ysrafil 2020) . while the structural proteins form capsid and envelope of the virus, non-structural proteins are involved in various steps of viral life cycle such as replication, translation, packaging and release (lai and cavanagh 1997) . although at a slower rate, mutations are emerging in the sars-cov-2 genome which might modulate viral transmission, replication efficiency and virulence in different regions of the world (jia et al. 2020; pachetti et al. 2020) .the genome sequence data has revealed that sars-cov-2 is a member of the genus betacoronavirus and belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus that includes sars-cov while mers-cov belongs to a separate subgenus, merbecovirus (lu et al. 2020; wu et al. 2020; zhu et al. 2020) . sars-cov-2 is approximately 79% similar to sars cov at the nucleotide sequence level. epidemiological data suggests that sars-cov-2 had spread widely from the city of wuhan in china (chinazzi et al. 2020 ) after its zoonotic transmission originating from bats via the malayan pangolins . global sequence and epidemiological data reveals that since its emergence, sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly to all parts of the globe, facilitated by its ability to use the human ace2 receptor for cellular entry (hoffmann et al. 2020) . the accumulating mutations in the sars-cov-2 genome have resulted in the evolution of 11 clades out of which the ancestral clade o originated in wuhan.since the first report of sequence of sars-cov-2 from india, there have been multiple sequence submissions in global initiative on sharing all influenza data (gisaid, https://www.gisaid.org/). extensive sequencing of the viral genome from different regions in india is required urgently. this will provide information on the prevalence of various viral clades and any regional differences therein, which might lead to improved understanding of the transmission patterns, tracking of the outbreak and formulation of effective containment measures. the mutation data might provide important clues for development of efficient vaccines, antiviral drugs and diagnostic assays. we have initiated a study on sequencing of sars-cov-2 genome from swab samples obtained from infected individuals from different regions of west bengal in eastern india and report here the first nine sequences and the results of analysis of the sequence data with respect to other sequences reported from the country until date. we have detected unique mutations in the rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), spike (s) and nucleocapsid (n) coding viral genes. it appears that the mutation in nucleocapsid gene might lead to alterations in local structure of the n protein. also the putative sites of mirna binding could be affected, which might have major consequences. the possible implications of the mutations have been discussed, which will provide important insights for functional validation to understand the molecular basis of differential disease severity.the regional virus research & diagnostic laboratory (vrdl) in indian council of medical research-national institute of cholera and enteric diseases (icmr-niced) is a government-designated laboratory for providing laboratory diagnosis for sars-cov-2 (covid19) in eastern india. nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs in viral transport media (vtm) (himedia labs, india) collected from suspect cases with acute respiratory symptoms/travel history to affected countries or contacts of the covid-19 confirmed cases were referred to the laboratory for diagnosis. the test reports were provided to the health authorities for initiating treatment and quarantine measures. residual deidentified positive samples for sars-cov-2 were used for rna isolation and sequencing in accordance with ethics guidelines of govt. of india.extraction of viral rna from the clinical sample (200 ll) was performed using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit as per manufacturer's protocol (qiagen, germany). the extracted rna was tested for sars-cov-2 (covid-19) by real time reverse transcription pcr (qrt-pcr) (abi 7500, applied biosystems, usa) using the protocol provided by niv-pune, india (https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/labs/1_sop_for_first_ line_screening_assay_for_2019_ncov.pdf; https://www. icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/labs/2_sop_for_confirmatory_ assay_for_2019_ncov.pdf).briefly, first line screening was done for envelope e gene and rnase p (internal control). clinical samples positive for e gene (ct b 35.0) were subjected to confirmatory test with primers specific for rdrp and hku orf (hku-orf1-nsp14). positive control and no template control were run for all genes. a specimen was considered confirmed positive for sars-cov-2 if reaction growth curves crossed the threshold line within 35 cycles (ct cut off b 35.0) for e gene, and both rdrp, orf or either rdrp or orf.rna isolated from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were depleted of ribosomal rna using ribo-zero rrna removal kit (illumina, usa). the residual rna was then converted to double stranded cdna and sequencing libraries prepared using truseq stranded total rna library preparation kit (illumina inc, usa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the sequencing libraries were checked using high sensitivity d1000 screentape in 2200 tapestation system (agilent technologies, usa) and quantified by real time pcr using library quantitation kit (kapa biosystems, usa). the libraries were sequenced using miseq reagent kit v3 in miseq system (illumina inc, usa) to generate 2x100 bp paired end sequencing reads. for viral genome amplification in samples which did not generate sufficient viral reads, the rna samples were converted to double stranded cdna and amplified using qiaseq sars-cov-2 primer panel (qiagen gmbh, germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the multiplexed amplicon pools were then converted to sequencing libraries by enzymatic fragmentation, end repair and ligation to adapters. the sequencing libraries were checked and quantified as above and sequenced using miseq reagent kit v2 nano in miseq system (illumina inc, usa) to generate 2x150 bp paired end sequencing reads.the sequencing reads obtained in shotgun rna-seq experiment were mapped to reference viral sequence, variants detected and consensus sequence for each sample built using dragen rna pathogen detection software (version 9) in basespace (illumina inc, usa). for amplified whole genome sequencing, the viral sequences were assembled using clc genomics workbench v20.0.3 (qiagen gmbh, germany). in both cases, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate wuhan-hu-1 as reference genome (accession nc_045512.2) was used as the reference sequence. each variant call generated in either pipeline was manually verified in integrated genome viewer igv v7.8.2 (jt robinson et al. 2017) . clustal omega was used to display the mutations in the context of the sequence alignments. bioedit software (v7.2) was used to extract the cds from consensus sequence and to check codon usage. nucleotide to amino acid conversion was done in emboss transeq online tool (f madeira et al. 2019).to generate the clustering patterns of the viral sequences from west bengal, a subset of representative virus sequence data (n = 310) were downloaded from gisaid global database (supplementary table 1). only high coverage data (where the entries have less than 1% n's and less than 0.05% amino acid mutations), complete genome (entries with base pair greater than 29,000) and excluding low coverage entries (entries having more than 5% n's) were used in the analysis. all of the sequences were aligned using mafft (multiple alignment using fast fourier transform). we used the nextstrain pipeline to process the sequence data. nextstrain with the augur pipeline was used to build phylogenetic tree based on the iqtree method, which is a fast and effective stochastic algorithm to infer phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood. the tree building process involves the use of these subtypes 'wuhan-hu-1/2019', 'wuhan/wh01/2019' to generate the root of the tree. the tree is refined using raxml (randomized axelerated maximum likelihood). a web-based visualization program, auspice was then used to present and interact with phylogenetic and phylogeographic data.we investigated the potential mirna binding site in the region coding for n protein, found to be mutated in our samples. starmir (http://sfold.wadsworth.org/cgibin/starmirtest2.pl) software was used for this purpose. the whole human mature mirna library was obtained from mirbase database. the sequence in query was taken 50 nt upstream and 50 nt downstream from the site of mutation. the mirnas which bind to the mutation site through seed sequence were shortlisted. the change in bases can prevent certain mirna binding and support the binding of others. therefore, mirna binding was checked for both, original and mutated site. we checked the levels of mirnas in the cancer conditions around the upper respiratory tract in the dbdemc2 database (https://www.picb.ac.cn/ dbdemc/). the tissueatlas database (https://ccbweb.cs.uni-saarland.de/tissueatlas/) was used to analyse the presence and correlation of mirnas in body fluids.all patients were diagnosed positive for sars-cov-2 rna by real time pcr as described above. five of the patients suffered from fever, while seven patients exhibited some symptoms of infection like sore throat, cough with sputum, running nose or breathlessness. one patient suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). two patients did not exhibit any symptom (table 1) . five individuals had contact with covid-19 patients in particular; both s2 and s3 had contact with the same patient (table 1). one individual had history of international travel while another had history of domestic travel.the shotgun rna-seq data resulted in high coverage (greater than 100x median depth of coverage) of complete genome sequences of the sars-cov-2 in five samples (s2, s3, s5, s6 and s11) in which greater than 96% of the viral genome was covered at greater than 5x and greater than 99% of the viral genome was covered at greater than 1x. a negative correlation was found between viral load (represented by the threshold cycle or ct value of the rna samples in the real time pcr based diagnostic assay) and the number of reads mapped to the viral genome in the rna-seq library. even with 9 samples, the pearson correlation coefficient was found to be -0.63 (p value = 0.036) (table 1). in particular, it was observed that samples with ct values greater than 25 mostly resulted in generation of low counts of viral sequence reads leading to less than 15x median depth of coverage of the viral genome. in the remaining four samples (s1, s8, s10 and s12), the median depth of coverage was less than 15x and hence the viral genome sequencing was achieved after amplification of the viral genome by a multiplex pcr approach. all the nine sequences have been submitted in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (gisaid) database.phylogenetic tree analysis of the sequences, along with other complete viral genome sequences submitted from india in gisaid, revealed that seven of these sequences belonged to the a2a clade while only one sequence belonged to clade b4 (figure 1 and table 1). we were unable to classify one of the nine sequences, s1, into any clade due to low sequence coverage. to understand transmission histories of these nine sars-cov-2 isolates from west bengal, we aligned these sequences with more than 6000 global sequences, including thirty sequences submitted in gisaid from india (at the time of our analysis) to identify specific mutations that occur at the highest level of the tip in a branch leading to the specific subtype. the predicted origin of the transmitted subtype in each case was identified with 98-100% confidence from the branch in which our samples were located in the phylogenetic tree (table 1) .the list of mutations detected in the sequences from nine samples are provided (table 2) . seven sequences harboured the important signature mutations of a2a clade. these consisted of the 14408 c/t mutation resulting in a change of p323l in the rdrp and the 23403 a/g mutation resulting in a change of d614g in the spike glycoprotein of the virus. in addition to these, 24933 g/t mutation in the gene coding for spike glycoprotein (g1124v) and triple base mutations of 2881-2883 ggg/aac in the gene coding for nucleocapsid resulting in two consecutive amino acid changes r203k and g204r were detected in s2, s3 and s2, s3, s5 respectively. while the 24933 g/t s gene mutation was unique to these samples and could not be found in any other sequence from india or the rest of the world, the nucleocapsid mutations could be detected in only three other sequences from india (figure 2). out of these, two sequences were obtained from individuals with contact history of a covid-19 patient who had travelled from italy. interestingly, two out of three sequences harbouring these mutations obtained by us belonged to kolkata and with contact history with one covid-19 patient who had travelled from london (uk). the third sequence was obtained from a covid-19 patient from darjeeling, india who had history of travel from chennai, india. these mutations have been found in 16% of sars-cov-2 sequences reported world-wide from countries like uk, netherlands, iceland, belgium, portugal, usa, australia, brazil, etc.rdrp (nsp12) gene of the sars-cov-2 codes for the rna-dependent rna polymerase and is vital for the replication machinery of the virus. we detected a total of six mutations in this gene in the nine samples, out of which four were nonsynonymous, including the a2a clade specific 14408 c/t (rdrp: p323l) mutation. two individuals, s11 and s12, harboured viral genome sequences that shared a unique 13730 c/t (a88v) mutation which was not found in any other sequence reported from india or rest of the world. one individual s10, whose viral sequence belonged to b4 clade, harboured 3 mutations in rdrp, which appear to be clade specific, out of which 2 were nonsynonymous.to study the functional relevance of the mutations, we investigated the alteration in mirna binding in the nucleocapsid coding region, predicted to be caused by the 28881-3 ggg/aac mutations. we found seven mirnas which bind to the original sequence and three which bind the mutated sequence exclusively (table 3  and figure 3 ). the number of bases in the sequence (ggg/aac) which bind the seed sequence of mirna were also identified. the strength of mirna prediction is reflected by the dg value mentioned in the figure 3. mutant base s1 s2 s3 s5 s6 s8 s10 s11 s12 lesser the value, stronger is the binding. the values are comparable to some of the experimentally validated mirna bindings like mir122 binding to hcv rna has dg value of -18.3 kcal/mol for s1 binding site and -22.6 kcal/mol for s2 binding site (data not shown).the values of dg obtained for the mirnas binding to n protein coding region are comparable to these values, suggesting their relevance in the in vivo conditions. we checked the levels of these mirnas in cancer conditions around the upper respiratory tract in the only two samples from west bengal (s11 and s12) harbour this mutation. (d) 14323 c/t, 14326 c/a and 14331 t/c mutations in the rdrp gene in clustal omega. only one sample from west bengal (s10) harbour these mutations. dbdemc2 database. we found that mir-24-1-5p and mir-299-5p were downregulated in most of the cancers. mir-24-2-5p was found to be upregulated in esophageal cancer (esca), head and neck cancer (hnsc), lung cancer (luca) and downregulated in nasopharyngeal cancer (nsca) (supplementary figure 1). assuming that the binding of mirnas would inhibit the viral replication/stability, higher abundance of that mirna would be protective against infection and lower abundance would increase the susceptibility towards infection. to comprehend the results, we have found that if a patient suffering from esca, hnsc, luca is infected with the original virus containing ggg sequence, the upregulated mir-24-2-5p would be protective against the infection. but, if the same patient is infected with the mutated virus containing aac sequence, mir-24-2-5p will not be functional anymore and mir-299-5p which targets the mutated site is also downregulated. this could make the patients suffering from described cancers, highly susceptible to infection with the mutant virus.we also checked if these mirnas are associated with other disease conditions and found that mir-299-5p is down regulated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) and hence could serve as one of factors for increased susceptibility of t2dm patients for the mutated viral subtype and increase the risk of comorbidity (huang et al. 2018) . another mir-3162-3p, targeting original subtype, is reported to be higher in asthma patients (fang et al. 2016) . this could be one of the factors limiting the original viral propagation, but the loss of its targeting site in mutated viral subtype could increase the host susceptibility towards viral infection.we further checked if there are some other conditions that could alter the availability of these mirnas at the site of infection. therefore, we used the tis-sueatlas database to analyse the presence and correlation of these mirnas in body fluids. we found that there is differential expression of certain mirnas in the saliva of patients suffering from pancreatic cancer. mir-642b-5p, mir-3162-3p and mir-299-5p were found to be upregulated in the saliva of pancreatic cancer patients which could provide similar protective/susceptible effect as mentioned of mirnas before (supplementary figure 2) . mirnas have been known to affect viral replication and stability by binding to protein coding regions of the genome of h1n1, ev71, cvb3 and many more viruses (bruscella et al. 2017; trobaugh and klimstra 2017) . in most of the cases, binding of mirnas leads to translational repression of the targeted protein and hence directly affects viral rna replication. targeting by mirnas could decrease the levels of n protein, which is involved in various steps of viral life cycle including replication, translation and coating of viral rna to form the nucleocapsid. hence, altered levels of the shortlisted mirna could regulate various viral processes and severity of sars-cov-2 infection. the effect of mirnas would be opposite if they assist in viral replication/stability, but that needs to be experimentally confirmed and still holds the importance of mirnas targeting the original and mutated sites.we analysed the 28881-3 ggg/aac mutations in the nucleocapsid gene which results in contiguous amino acid changes of r203k and g204r for their potential role in alteration of structure of the encoded protein.the sites of these mutations at position are located in the sr-rich region which is known to be intrinsically disordered (chang et al. 2014 ). in addition, this region is known to encompass a few phosphorylation hsa-mir-3162-3p 3 hsa-mir-4699-3p 2 hsa-mir-6826-3p 3 hsa-mir-299-5p 3 hsa-mir-5195-5p 3 hsa-mir-12132 1 hsa-mir-24-1-5p 2 hsa-mir-3679-3p 3 hsa-mir-642b-5p 3 hsa-mir-24-2-5p 2 sites (surjit et al. 2005) , notably the gsk3 phosphorylation site at ser202 and a cdk phosphorylation site at ser206 which are in close proximity to these mutations. the sequence motifs and are entirely consistent with gsk3 and cdk phosphorylation motifs, respectively. when ser202 is phosphorylated which incorporates a large negative group tethered to the sidechain of ser, as seen in many other substrates of kinases, it is likely that charge neutralization takes place involving positively charged sidechains in the sequential and spatial vicinity. arg203 is a part of gsk3 phosphorylation motif and its sidechain could potentially contribute to charge neutralization at p-ser202. given the sequential, and therefore spatial proximity of arg203 to p-ser206 the sidechain of arg203 could potentially be involved in interaction also with phosphate group at position 206. this interaction would contribute to reduction of conformational entropy. similarly, arg209, a part of cdk phosphorylation motif, would contribute to charge neutralization at p-ser206. arg203 and gly204 are mutated to lys and arg respectively (figure 4).spike protein (s) of coronaviruses is a class i viral fusion protein which is synthesized as a single chain precursor that trimerizes upon folding. it is composed of two subunits: s 1 (in the amino terminal) containing the receptor binding domain (rbd) and s 2 (in the carboxy terminal) that drives membrane fusion ( in all the three structure, d614 lies in a loop at the interface between any two out of the three protomers. the co-ordinates for the d614 side-chain in chain a and c of 6vyb are available only up to c b -atom and the orientation of these atoms are similar to that observed in the respective atoms of d614 in 6vxx. the co-ordinates of all the side-chain atoms of d614 in chain b of 6vyb are available and they are similar to that observed in chain b of 6vxx. the side-chain of d614 in all the protomers of 6vxx and chain b of 6vyb point outward from the core of the protein toward the solvent. the side-chain orientation of d614 in all the three chains of 6vsb is different from the former two structures. this differential orientation of d614 side-chain in 6vsb facilitates formation of hydrogen bond between d614 (present in s 1 subunit) and t859 (present in s 2 subunit) from the neighbouring chain in two out of the three interfaces found in 6vsb ( figure 6 ). taken together, these facts suggest that d614 is highly flexible and support the wobbly nature of the inter-protomeric hydrogen bond observed between d614 and t859. contribution of this transient hydrogen bond toward stability of the pre-fusion state cannot be negated. interestingly, s protein of mouse coronavirus (mhv-a59) which has a similar structural topology as that of the sars-cov-2 s protein but shares a low overall sequence identity (*32%), has a conservative substitution at the position equivalent to d614 of the latter. the asn (n655) of mouse coronavirus (mhv-a59) is replaced with asp (d614) in sars-cov-2 ( figure 5 and figure 7) . in earlier literature, n655 has been suggested to offer inter-protomeric interactions that contribute toward maintenance of the s 2 fusion machinery in its metastable state (ac walls et al. 2016) . given the conservation of asp at this position in closely related coronaviruses (bat coronaviruses: btcov-ratg13 and btcov-hku3; sars-cov) and its conservative substitution in mouse coronavirus (mhv-a59), it is likely that d614 is important for structural stability of s protein.as gly lacks a side-chain, the transient hydrogen bond as observed in the wild-type s protein would be lost in the variant with d614g mutation. this can potentially compromise on the structural stability of pre-fusion state of s protein possibly interfering with conformational transitions. moreover, replacement of asp with gly at this position would come with higher conformational freedom at the backbone (c ramakrishnan and gn ramachandran 1965) of the polypeptide resulting in enhancement of local conformational entropy.the gly at this position is solvent exposed and is present at the tip of the c-terminal end of a b-strand. this position is proximal to the region where the s protein attaches itself to the viral membrane (figure 5). it is to be noted that the gly at this position is conserved among the closely related coronaviruses (bat coronavirus ratg13 and hku3, sars-cov) hinting toward its possible role in maintenance of structure and function of the s protein (figure 7). in general, as explained above, gly backbone has higher conformational freedom than any other amino acid residues (ramakrishnan and ramachandran 1965) . therefore, figure 6 . conformation of d614 in three structures (6vxx, 6vyb, 6vsb). (a), (b), (c) overlay of d614 (6vxx: yellow carbon; 6vyb: white carbon; 6vsb: dark pink carbon) from chain a, b and c of the three structures, respectively. to maintain visual clarity, only the backbone of respective chain of 6vxx is shown in cartoon representation.

as black dashed line. the side-chain co-ordinates for d614 in chain a and c of 6vyb are unavailable. protein rendering has been done using pymol (schrödinger, llc). substitution of gly with val would impart rigidity to the local region. the possible implication of such rigidity on the association of s protein with viral membrane could be understood from a structure of s protein in association with the viral membrane. however, such a structure is currently unavailable.substantial uncertainties surround the trajectory of the recent epidemic of covid-19 in india. it is extremely important to track the outbreak by analysing the phylogenetic relationships between different sars-cov-2 genomes prevalent in india and compare them with genomes reported from rest of the world. the errorprone replication process of all rna viruses in general, results in introduction of mutations in their genomes which behave as a molecular clock that can provide insights into the emergence and evolution of the virus. the data till date suggests that sars-cov-2 emerged not long before the first cases of pneumonia in wuhan occurred .in this study, direct massively parallel sequencing of the viral genome was undertaken on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples collected from infected individuals from different districts of west bengal. we have analysed the first nine sequences in this report. recent analysis of sars-cov-2 sequences from all over the globe has revealed that the outbreaks have been initially triggered in most countries by the original strain from wuhan, clade o, which thereafter have diversified into multiple clades (yadav et al. 2020; biswas and majumder 2020) . temporal sweeps leading to replacement of the ancestral o and other clades by a2a, have been detected. until our report, initial sequences from samples obtained from individuals with travel history to china, reported genetic similarity to the clade o, which was obtained at the beginning of the outbreak in wuhan, china. rest of the sequences reported from india mostly belonged to either clade a3 (18%) or a2a (44%) (supplementary table 3), with evidence of the temporal sweep where the a2a is emerging as the predominant clade (biswas and majumder 2020) . the a2a clade is characterized by the signature nonsynonymous mutations leading to amino acid changes of p323l in the rdrp which is involved in replication of the viral genome and the change of d614g in the spike glycoprotein which is essential for the entry of the virus in the host cell by binding to the ace2 receptor. notably, the d614g mutation is close to the furin recognition site for cleavage of the spike protein, which plays an important role in virus entry. whether both these mutations have resulted in the evolution of a more transmissible viral subtype i.e. the a2a clade, is yet to be verified by in vitro and in silico analyses. interestingly, we also found that one of viral sequences in our study belonged to the b4 clade, which originated in china (gonzalez-reiche et al. 2020). b4 clade sequences have not been reported from india earlier and are only less than 1% of sequences reported worldwide. probably, the individual s10 was transmitted this subtype by contact with others who had travel history to china although this information was not available in the patient clinical history.emergence of viral subclones in an outbreak can affect the transmission patterns and disease severity, which are immensely important for public health (harvala et al. 2017; jones et al. 2019) . given the large size of the infected population in india, with the possibility of regional differences in the population and host-related factors, this can have the potential to affect the course of the outbreak. population surveillance is essential for early detection of emergence of such subclones. we analysed the mutations detected in each sequence that we generated and found preliminary evidence of this. we found that three individuals of this study, viz. s2, s3 and s5, shared rare set of three contiguous mutations in their genome which resulted in the consecutive alterations of r203k and g204r. these mutations were also found to be shared with 3 other sequences reported from western india. interestingly, while two out the three sequences harbouring these mutations were from individuals who shared contact history with a covid-19 patient with history of travel from italy, two out of the three samples from west bengal shared contact history with the same covid-19 patient with history of travel from uk. the third individual whose sample harboured these mutations, viz. s5, was found to have history of travel from chennai, india, but the possibility of the patient having contact in transit with an individual with international travel history cannot be excluded. additionally, origin of the viral subtypes infecting s5 and s6 has also been predicted by phylogenetic analysis to be europe (uk). s6 had been infected in delhi, india where he had contact with an infected individual who travelled from europe. one of the individuals s10, harboured a viral subtype which is predicted to have been transmitted in china. s2 and s3, who shared an identical sequence of the virus, also harboured one unique mutation resulting in the amino acid alteration of g1124v in the spike protein. this correlates with the fact that these two individuals had also been known to have contact with the same covid-19 patient. viral rna sequences obtained from two samples s11 and s12 shared all mutations except a v32l mutation at orf8 harboured by s11 and not by s12. interestingly, both these individuals belonged to the same district of east medinipur, had history of contact with covid-19 patients and did not exhibit any clinical symptom. thus our findings indicate that the viral subtypes transmitted in the eastern region of india, in particular west bengal, have mostly originated from europe and also china. sequencing of large number of samples are being presently undertaken to confirm and elaborate these initial findings.rdrp is essential for replication of viral rna genome and hence this gene is expected to be conserved. interestingly, we detected multiple mutations in this gene, the majority of which were non synonymous and hence result in alteration of protein sequence. in particular, the p323l was present in all a2a sequences in our samples. this mutation is located adjacent to a hydrophobic cleft in rdrp which is a promising target for potential drugs (pachetti et al. 2020) . sequences from two samples, s11 and s12, shared a unique rdrp mutation at a88v which has not been detected until date in rest of the sequences submitted from india or worldwide. as observed earlier, these two samples harbour viral subtypes whose genomes are strikingly similar. sequence obtained from one of the samples s10, which belonged to the clade b4, did not possess the p323l mutation. instead, it harboured three different mutations resulting in two non-synonymous changes of h286y, p287t and a synonymous mutation which were not found in any other sequences reported from india until date and are specific for the b4 clade. it remains to be seen whether these amino acid alterations result in substantial changes in structure or function of rdrp, resulting in emergence of drug resistant subtypes or enhancement in mutation rate in the viral genome.we investigated the potential of the mutations detected in the nucleocapsid region to effect alterations in the viral and host processes. we found that this mutation results in considerable alterations in the predicted binding of mirnas, which might play a role in the establishment and progress of infection in the patient. we also found that some of the mirnas which are predicted to bind to the mutated subtype might be downregulated in multiple cancer types. this raises the possibility that cancer patients might have higher susceptibility to the mutated sub-clone due to the reduced ability to contain the virus in vivo, compared to infection by the original virus of the same clade. the leads obtained from this study need to be pursued to develop mirna based novel therapeutic approaches.we also analysed the predicted structural alterations in the viral nucleocapsid protein, which might be caused by consecutive alterations of r203k and g204r. as a result of these mutations, we have two strong positively charged residues in close sequential positions as opposed to only one positively charged residue in the other genotype. given the structural vicinity of p-ser202 and p-ser206 and the long sidechains of lys and arg with high positive charge and significant side-chain conformational freedom in this genotype, both these residues potentially could contribute to charge neutralization of the phosphorylated serine residues. this contributes to further reduction of conformational entropy compared to the other genotype. while lys203 is likely to offer electrostatic interactions to p-ser202, arg204 (with a greater number of positively charged centres as compared to lys) could potentially simultaneously interact with the phosphate groups at both p-ser202 and p-ser206. together, these two positively charged residues (lys203 and arg204) have the potential to offer additional interactions to the phosphorylated serine residues at 202 and 206 positions as opposed to only one of them (arg203) in the other genotype. consequently, one can expect a significant difference in conformational entropy as well as in the inter-residue interaction structural network between the two genotypes especially when ser202 and ser206 are phosphorylated. further, gly at position 204 in one of the genotypes would confer significantly higher conformational freedom at the backbone (ramakrishnan and ramachandran 1965) of the polypeptide chain compared to arg in the equivalent position in the other genotype. this mutation adds another dimension to the likely structural differences in this local region of the two genotypes. subsequently, phosphorylation-mediated functional events might be different in the two genotypes (surjit and lal 2008; surjit et al. 2006 ). these proposed differences in the inter-residue structural network between the two genotypes are depicted schematically in figure 4 . admittedly, the proposed network of interactions is fraught with uncertainty. however, given two positively charged residues in one genotype compared to only one in the other genotype, the charge neutralization structural interaction networks involving p-ser202 and p-ser206 has to be certainly different going by the highly established literature on kinase substrates (kitchen et al. 2008; krupa et al. 2004) .interestingly, the mutations d614g (in s d domain) is supposed to confer flexibility in the s d domain and the mutation g1124v might impart partial rigidity in the conformation of s 2 domain. obvious question is whether such structural alterations in local region would have any consequence in receptor binding affinity of spike protein. since the mutation resides in rbd domain-s1 subunit of spike protein, residue 614 is not directly involved in the interaction with ace2. but the mutation might have some effect on the positioning of the residues involved in interaction. now to address the concerns whether these mutations are expected to affect the sensitivity of the existing diagnostic kit, we have again explored the implications of the structural changes. most likely, the presence of mutation should not affect the rapid detection kits because these kits detect the presence of specific igg/igm antibody against viral n protein or viral s protein. the whole protein is coated for the test and therefore polyclonal antibodies would provide the result here. change in just one epitope might not affect the overall result. we have further checked if the mutation sites fall in immunodominant epitopes. this data is available for sars proteins and the sites where we have found mutation have been shown to be conserved in sars and sars-cov-2.while the mutation site of n protein does not elicit much antibody response, region 603-634 of the s protein of sars has been shown to be a major immunodominant epitope in s protein (he et al. 2004) . change in this epitope by mutation could alter the sensitivity of the igg/igm tests conducted.also, there are certain diagnostic kits being designed to check the presence of viral antigen in the clinical sample. the abundance of antibodies targeting the mutation sites needs to be checked in those kits, to be more effective across the viral strains harbouring different mutations.we also detected interesting relationships between ct value of diagnostic assay as a surrogate of viral copy number and viral sequence reads obtained. we recommend that for future sequencing studies, the shotgun rna-seq approach should be used for high viral copy number represented by low ct values while for rest, a viral genome amplification method should be used. although the sample size of our preliminary report is small, follow up studies are underway to confirm these observations for understanding the impact of the same in the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 in india. we have not commented on the relationship of the viral sequence alterations with disease severity due to the limited sample size of this analysis. we hope to provide valuable information on this aspect based on the expanded number of samples being sequenced at present. our findings provide leads which might benefit outbreak tracking and development of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to contain the infection.finally, we conclude that the initial sequences generated by us from first nine samples in west bengal in eastern india indicate a selective sweep of the a2a clade of sars-cov-2. however, the viral population is not homogenous and other clades like b4 also exist. we have also detected emergence of mutations in the important regions of the viral genome including spike, rdrp and nucleocapsid coding genes. some of these mutations are predicted to have impact on viral and host factors, which might affect transmission and disease severity. this preliminary evidence of emergence of multiple subclones of sars-cov-2, which might have altered phenotypes, can have important consequences on the ongoing outbreak in india.during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. we also acknowledge the

release of virions. all subtypes of infl uenza a virus, from h1 to h16 and n1 to n9, are detected in wild water birds; h17n10 is found in bats. 1 although most infections with these subtypes are mild or asymptomatic in avian species, outbreaks in wild birds and poultry have been associated with highly pathogenic avian infl uenza h5, and outbreaks in poultry have been associated with h7 subtypes. 1,2 human infections are generally con-fi ned to h1, h2, and h3 subtypes, because these subtypes have affi nity for host cell receptors containing α-2,6-linked sialic acid (which occur in human beings), whereas other avian infl uenza viruses generally preferentially attach to avian host cell receptors, which contain α-2,3-linked sialic acid. direct trans mission of avian infl uenza viruses from domestic poultry to people have been documented only for the h5n1, h7n2, h7n3, h7n7, h9n2, and h10n7 subtypes. 1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] human infections due to these subtypes were generally mild and manifested as conjunctivitis and upper-respiratory-tract infections, except for the h5n1 subtype, which was associated with mortality of greater than 50%, and the h7n7 subtype, which has caused one death. 1,4 since february, 2013, a novel reassortant h7n9 virus associated with human deaths but no apparent outbreaks in poultry and wild birds has emerged in eastern china. we report on four patients with severe infection due to this h7n9 virus. we sequenced, characterised, and compared viral genomes from a patient and an epidemiologically linked wet market chicken isolate.between march 7 and april 8, 2013 , we included hospital inpatients if they had new-onset respiratory symptoms, unexplained radiographic infi ltrate, and laboratory-con fi rmed h7n9 virus infection at the first affi liated hospital, college of medicine, zhejiang university, hangzhou; xiaoshan people's hospital, hanzhou; or huzhou central hospital, huzhou (all in china) . this study was approved by the institutional and haemato logical, biochemical, radiological, and micro biological investigation results into a predesigned database. we recorded patients' acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii (apache-ii) scores 8 and defi ned acute respiratory distress syn drome and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome on the basis of standard criteria. 9,10 presumed incubation period was defi ned as the time between last poultry exposure and onset of symptoms. all laboratory procedures for respiratory secretions have been previously reported. 11 briefl y, we used taqman real-time rt-pcr under standard thermo cycling conditions to detect m, h7, and n9 genes. the primers that we used were m-forward (gagtggctaaagacaagaccaatc), m-reverse (ttggacaaagcgtctacgc), and m-probe (fam-tcaccgtgcccagtgagcgag-bhq1); h7-forward (agagtcattrcaraatagaatacagat), h7reverse (cacygcatgtttccattctt), and h7-probe (fam-aaacatgatgccccgaagctaaac-bhq1); and n9-forward (gttctatgctctcagccaagg), n9reverse (cttgaccacccaatgcattc) and n9-probe (hex-taagctrgccactatcatcaccrcc-bhq1). the detection limit of the m, h7 and n9 rt-pcr assays was about 100 copies of rna per ml. all samples were cultured with trypsin in the madin-darby canine kidney cell line for 7 days. we did immunofl uorescent antigen staining for infl uenza a nucleoprotein (d3 ultra 8 dfa, respiratory virus screening and identifi cation kit, diagnostic hybrid, oh, usa) under ultraviolet microscopy (eurostar iii plus, euroimmune ag, lubeck, germany) in cell cultures with positive cytopathic changes. rt-pcr was used to subtype for h1, h3, h5, h9, and h7.we assessed patients' respiratory tract samples on admission by multiplex pcr (luminex 200 system, luminex, tx, usa); did resplex ii v2.0 assays (qiagen, germany) to detect co-infection with respiratory syncytial virus, infl uenza b virus, parainfl uenza viruses 1-4, human metapneumo virus, enteroviruses, rhino virus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and coronaviruses nl63, hku1, 229e, and oc43; and used pcr to detect co-infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae and chlamydophila pneumoniae. 12 we investigated blood, sputum, or endotracheal aspirates and urine samples bacteriologically, as clinically indi cated. initial urine samples were tested for pneumococcal and legionella antigens by immuno chromatographic enzyme immuno assay (binax now streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen test and binax now legionella urinary antigen test, binax, me, usa). we used the luminex enzyme immunoassay (luminex, tx, usa) to monitor six diff erent serum cytokines or chemokines-namely, interferon γ, inter leukins 2, 4, 6, and 10, and tumour necrosis factor α (tnfα)-as a measure of host immunological responses.cloacal swabs were collected from 20 chickens, four quails, fi ve pigeons, and 57 ducks from six epidemi ologically linked wet markets (four in hanzhou city and two in huzhou city, zhejiang) and stored in viral trans port medium. the collected samples were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs and viral replication was detected by haemadsorption, which has been previously de scribed. 13 we identifi ed and subtyped isolates by rt-pcr sequencing (we used h7-specifi c and n9-specifi c pri mers). rna extraction, complementary dna syn thesis, and pcr sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. 13 sequencing was done with the bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit on the 3130xl genetic analyzer (applied biosystems, ny, usa). we characterised and phylogenetically analysed all eight gene segments of the patient's and the chicken's isolates together with virus sequence data available from genbank. all sequences were assembled and edited with lasergene 6.0 (dnastar, wn, usa); bioedit 7 was used for alignment and analysis of aminoacid residues. we used the mega software package v5.05 (center for evolutionary medicine and informatics, biodesign institute, az, usa) to construct the phylogenetic trees of h, n, pb2, and ns genes on the basis of the neighbour-joining method, with tamura-nei model of nucleotide substitution. the nucleotide of the ha1 region was used for analysis. bootstrap values from 1000 replicates were calculated to assess the reliability of the phylogenetic tree. our gene sequences are deposited in genbank (accession numbers kc885955-62 [human isolate], kc899666-73 [chicken isolate]).the sponsors had no role in study design; data collection, analysis, or interpretation; or writing of the report. the corres ponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.all four patients had history of poultry contact (table 1) . the presumed incubation period ranged from 3 to 8 days (mean 5·8 days). mean age was 56 years (table 1) . none of the patients were obese and none had upperrespiratory-tract symptoms or conjunctivitis. all patients had fever, and lower-respiratory-tract symptoms (includ ing dyspnoea, cough, and sputum), and one had prominent myalgia (table 1) . chest radiography and ct of all patients showed multilobar patchy consolidation and diff use alveolar opacities (fi gure 1a-1f). ct of patients 1 and 4 showed ground glass changes in some areas. mean time between onset of symptoms and respira tory failure was 9 days. three patients were given 75 mg oral oseltamivir twice daily after tests for h7n9 virus were positive, starting a mean of 16 days after onset of symptoms onset (table 1) . all patients required respiratory support-oxygen given through nasal cannulae at presentation. two patients needed non-invasive ventilation by con tinuous positive airway pressure, and three subsequently received mechan ical ventilation. two patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and all received intra venous methylprednisolone (table 1) . two patients (pa tients 1 and 3) died 4 days after intubation. the other two patients were recovering clinically and radiologically and had been successfully extubated at the time of writing (fi gure 1). 303 house hold or workplace contacts and 82 health-care workers with unprotected exposure to the four patients were put under medical surveillance but none of them became symptomatic after 14 days. table 2 lists the results of laboratory investigations in the patients. all patients had pronounced lymphopenia at presentation. total leucocyte counts were healthy or low at presentation, but leucocytosis with neutrophilia developed with disease progression. three patients had thrombocytopenia at presentation. all patients' coagu lation profi les were impaired and d-dimer concentrations substantially increased with disease progression. the patients who died had persistent lymphopenia, renal results for when the patients presented and the patients' most abnormal result during disease progression are given. if the reading at presentation was the most abnormal reading, only one result is given.impairment, and rising aspartate transaminase and d-dimer concentrations. hepatic aminotransferases, c-reactive protein, and creatine kinase or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were increased in all patients at some stage of illness; derangement was worse in those who died. overall, serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations were substantially higher in patient 3 (who died) than in patient 2 (who survived) (fi gure 2a, 2b). patient 3 had persistently high serum interleukin 10 concentrations (fi gure 2b) before death. rt-pcr assays of throat swab samples or sputum samples yielded positive results for h7n9 infection in all patients (table 3) . serial samples from patient 2 were tested; throat swab samples were consistently negative, but sputum samples were positive (table 3) . h7n9 virus was isolated from respiratory specimens from patients 1, 3, and 4 in cell culture, and confi rmed by rt-pcr (in which h7-specifi c and n9-specifi c primers were used). no viral co-infections were detected by multiplex pcr, and no bacterial or fungal co-infections were detected in 14 blood cultures and 16 respiratory secretion cultures. two of fi ve pigeons (40%), four of 20 chickens (20%), zero of four quails (0%), and zero of 57 ducks (0%) tested positive for the h7n9 virus.sequence analysis of patient 3 and an epi demiologically linked chicken's h (1673 of 1683 bases [99·4%] ) and n (1394 of 1398 bases [99·7%]) genes showed that the human h7n9 isolate was almost identical to chicken h7n9 isolate. the h7 in the isolates clustered with h of the h7n3 of ducks in zhejiang, and the isolate n9 clustered with the n of the h7n9 of wild birds in korea (fi gure 3). the six internal genes of the isolate h7n9 are closest to those of poultry h9n2 viruses of china (fi gure 4).analysis of the h7 receptor binding site showed a gln226leu substitution in the human isolate and a gly186val substitution (h3 numbering) in both human and chicken isolates (table 4). no multibasic aminoacids were noted at the proteolytic cleavage site of this h7 in either the human or the chicken isolates. although the pb2 glu627lys substitution frequently detected in human h5n1 isolates was not noted, an asp701asn substitution was noted in the human isolate. deletion of fi ve aminoacids in the stalk region of n9 at position 69-73 (n9 numbering) was noted in the human and chicken h7n9 isolates. we detected a premature stop codon near the c-terminus of ns1, leading to pdz motif deletion, in all h7n9 isolates. a ser31asn substitution of the m2 gene associated with adamantane resistance was recorded in both isolates, but we noted no resistance mutations associated with neuraminidase inhibitors.we diagnosed avian infl uenza a h7n9 in all four patients (who were epidemiologically unlinked), two of whom died and two of whom were recovering at the time of writing (panel). all patients had histories of occupational or wet market exposure to poultry. the genes of the h7n9 virus in patient 3's isolate were phylogenetically clustered with those of the epidemiologically linked wet market chicken h7n9 isolate. human and chicken isolate h7 clustered with that of h7n3 of ducks in zhejiang, and human and chicken isolate n9 clustered with that of h7n9 of wild birds in korea, and the six internal genes of the isolate h7n9 are closest to those of poultry h9n2 viruses of china. these fi ndings suggest sporadic poultry-toperson transmission. normal ranges: interferon γ (0·01-13·64 pg/ml); interleukin 2 (0·01-10·67 pg/ml); interleukin 4 (0·01-2·25 pg/ml); interleukin 6 (0·01-8·86 pg/ml); interleukin 10 (2·42-16·33 pg/ml); and tumour necrosis factor α (0·82-11·05 pg/ml).as was the case with infl uenza a h5n1 virus in 1997, 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus in 2003, 15 and human coronavirus emc in 2012, 16, 17 infection with a novel virus was suspected because the pneumonia of these patients did not respond to typical and atypical antibiotic coverage. the four patients were clustered within zhejiang, china, within a few weeks (when migratory birds were moving north and transiting at the yangtze river delta). however, unlike other types of avian infl uenza aff ecting human beings, no increase in poultry deaths was noticed before the onset of human infec tions. after diagnosis of infl uenza a h7n9 infection was con fi rmed in patient 1 by rt-pcr, additional and retro spective testing of 486 patients between march 7 and april 8, 2013 , led to the discovery of three further infected patients. similar to those infected with h5n1, our patients had few upper-respiratory-tract symptoms. 1 they presented with high fevers, lower-respiratory-tract symptoms (especially dyspnoea), and radiological features of con solidation and ground glass changes. multiorgan in volvement was shown by abnormal results of liver and renal function tests, myalgia (with high creatine kinase concentrations suggestive of myositis), impaired coagu lation, and severe lymphopenia. gastrointestinal symp toms were noted only in patient 1-a profi le that diff ers from that in previous reports of h5n1 or severe a h1n1 pdm09 infections. 1 respiratory failure progressed within 3-14 days and death 1-3 weeks after onset of symptoms. however, none of these clinical, radiological, or labora tory fi ndings was pathognomonic. oseltamivir was begun late (mean 16 days after symptom onset) because of the late presentation of respiratory failure and delay in virological diagnosis.similar to the cytokine storm noted in h5n1 infection, the substantially increased concentrations of proinfl am matory and anti-infl ammatory serum cytokines and chemokines in patient 3 (who died) were compatible with the clinical severity of this novel h7n9 infection. 18 in particular, the serum concentrations of interleukin 10 were persistently increased in patient 3-a fi nding similar to that for severe a h1n1 pdm09 infection. 12 although serial rt-pcr assays of sputum samples from patient 2 were positive for viral infection, cycle thresholds were low 15-20 days after onset of symptoms and corroborated well with decreasing serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations.besides the likely absence of protection by pre-existing neutralising antibodies in the general population, the internal genes from the h9n2 virus might also contribute to the severe pathogenesis of this novel infection. double and even triple reassortant avian h9n2 viruses were well reported, 19 and the six internal genes of the 1997 h5n1 virus originated from avian h9n2 virus. furthermore, h9n2 and h5n1 viruses both induced prominent cytokine and chemokine activation in human macrophages and epithelial cells compared with that induced by seasonal infl uenza a h1n1 virus. 20 in previous studies, treatment with convalescent plasma or hyperimmune γ globulin seemed to improve survival of patients and therefore hyperimmune γ globulin should be considered in the treatment of severe h7n9 infection. 21 immunomodulatory agents such as celecoxib (but not corticosteroids) improve outcomes of h5n1 infections in mice. 22 other host factors, such as smoking and obesity, are risk factors for severe infl uenza. 23, 24 findings from murine models challenged with infl uenza viruses suggest that smoking worsens the response of proinfl ammatory chemokine and cytokines and histological changes of infl ammatory infi ltrates and lung damage, increases viral titres, and impairs pulmonary adaptive t-lymphocyte responses to the virus. 25 rapid virological diagnosis was established by rt-pcr of the m, h7, and n9 genes and confi rmed by viral culture in cell lines. similar to h5n1 infection, which mainly aff ected the lower respiratory tract, sputum and endotracheal aspirates might be better than nasopharyngeal and throat swabs for detection of infl uenza a h7n9. 1 the predilection of infl uenza a h7n9 for the lower respiratory tract suggests that the virus might replicate more effi ciently there, where both α-2,3-linked and α-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors are noted. 1 α-2,3linked sialic acid was detected on non-ciliated cuboidal bronchiolar cells at the junction between the respiratory bronchiole and alveolus. a substantial number of cells lining the alveolar wall also expressed this receptor.the emergence of a new reassortant avian h7n9 virus causing human infections without preceding or concomitant outbreak in poultry was quite unexpected. this occurrence could be attributed to the absence of the multibasic aminoacid motif at the proteolytic cleavage site of h, which is associated with broad tissue tropism and organ dissemination and is therefore a key virulence marker of h5 or h7 subtypes of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza. 1 this multibasic cleavage site is a virulence marker in birds but is not confi rmed as a virulence marker in people. no pandemic virus has had this multibasic aminoacid motif. wild waterfowl such as ducks and geese were the original natural reservoir (for h1-16, n1-9) 26 and provide new genes for making new virus reassortants that then infect domestic poultry, such as chickens, ducks, and geese, which are in close contact with human beings. further adaptive genetic changes of such viruses in domestic poultry can enable transmission to people.the key concerns about the current outbreak of infl uenza a h7n9 virus are how the virus crosses the species barrier and whether it will further adapt to en able effi cient person-to-person transmission. sequence analysis showed that the human h7 had aminoacid substitutions associated with increased affi nity for the human α-2,6-linked sialic acid receptor. 27 however, binding to the α-2,3-linked sialic acid receptor is likely to be retained, allowing the virus to circulate in poultry and infect human lower-respiratory-tract mucosae, which contain both types of receptor. 1 shortening of the n stalk region of h5n1 viruses enhanced adaptation to land-based poultry. 28 an impor tant virus protein, pb2, in combination with two other viral proteins, pb1 and pa, comprise the viral rna polymerase complex. pb2 is an important determinant of the host range and virulence of infl uenza viruses. two aminoacids in pb2, 627lys and 701asn, have previously been detected in h5n1 viruses isolated from people. 18 coupled 627lys-701asp or 627glu-701asn substitutions were thought to be important for effi cient transmission. 29 although we did not note glu627lys substitution in pb2 in our human isolate, we did record asp701asn substitution. another study 14 of the current h7n9 outbreak detailed three cases of infection in shanghai and anhui, china; the viral isolates showed glu627lys mutation. we noted neither genetic signature for mammalian adaptation-ie, gln226leu and asp701asn-in the chicken isolate, which suggests that this genetic adap tation might have occurred after the virus jumped from the chicken to the patient.ser31asn mutation (associated with adamantane resistance) was noted, but neuraminidase inhibitors, includ ing oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, should still be active if given early in the course of illness. one patient did not receive any antivirals and three patients received oseltamivir more than 5 days after onset of symptoms. we do not know whether oseltamivir resistance will emerge (as was the case with the h5n1 virus) because the last h7n9-positive sample from patient 2 was not tested for oseltamivir resistance after 5 days of oseltamivir treatment. delayed initiation of oseltamivir treatment and use of corticosteroids have been associated with slow decreases in viral load and poor outcomes. 23 in 2003, an h7n7 virus, which contained the multibasic aminoacid motif associated with virulence and the genetic marker for mammalian adaptation (glu627lys) caused one fatal infection in the netherlands. 4 other severe human infections with the h7 subtype had not been reported before the current h7n9 outbreak. previous surveillance studies have shown the h7n3 virus to be present in domestic ducks in zhejiang. 30 avian h7 subtype viruses are likely to have become established in domestic poultry in zhejiang. interaction between newly established h7 subtypes and other avian infl uenza viruses, such as the h9n2 subtype, might have resulted in the current h7n9 strain, which has gained some ability to infect human beings. further adaptation could lead to less symptomatic infection and more effi cient person-to-person transmission. aggressive intervention to block further animal-to-person transmission in live poultry markets, as has previously been done in hong kong, should be considered. temporary closure of live bird markets and comprehensive programmes of surveillance, culling, improved biosecurity, segregation of diff erent poultry species, and possibly vaccination programmes to control h7n9 virus infection in poultry seem necessary to halt evolution of the virus into a pandemic agent.ll and k-yy were coprincipal investigators, designed and supervised the study, and wrote the grant application (assisted by yc). wl,

threats.swine influenza detection; xtag rvp test; detection of pandemic fluthe current outbreak of swine influenza that originated in mexico in march 2009 has spread to 39 countries in one month causing 8,480 cases globally with 66 deaths as of may 17. 1 the 2009 swine flu virus designated h1n1 a/swine/california/04/2009 is not zoonotic swine flu and is not transmitted from pigs to humans, but rather from person to person. in humans, h1n1 swine flu presents as an influenza-like illness (ili) with symptoms similar to those of seasonal influenza viz. namely chills, fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness and general discomfort. 2 since these symptoms are not specific to swine flu, early in the pandemic physicians were advised to consider swine influenza in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute febrile respiratory illness who had returned from mexico or been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu however, this epidemiological link will require modification. 3 this new strain of h1n1 swine influenza appears to be a result of reassortment of two swine influenza viruses, one from north america and one from europe with the north american virus itself the product of previous reassortments, carrying an avian pb2 gene for at least 10 years and a human pb1 gene since 1993. the hemagglutinin (ha) gene is similar to that of swine flu viruses present in united states pigs since 1999, while neuraminidase (na) and matrix (m) genes resemble viruses present in european pigs. viruses with this genetic makeup have not previously been found in humans or pigs, although there is no formal national surveillance system to identify what viruses are circulating in pigs in north america. the genetic makeup of this virus is germaine to the design of molecular tests for diagnosis.multiplex pcr testing for the detection of respiratory viruses has seen major advances over the past decade resulting in the development of several commercially available tests. 4 these tests can amplify one or more genes from a number of respiratory viruses and detect amplified products using microgene arrays. one test, the xtag ™ rvp test, was developed to detect 20 different virus types and subtypes in a single test using multiplex rt-pcr and detection with a microfluidic array on the luminex 100 instrument. 5 the xtag ™ rvp test was developed in 2005 immediately following sars and h5n1 influenza and was designed to detect and type the three influenza a subtypes circulating at that time viz. h1, h3 and h5.understanding how the xtag ™ rvp test identifies influenza a is important to its detection of new "non-seasonal" influenza viruses. the test amplifies a conserved part of the matrix gene found in all influenza a viruses and specific regions of the h1 or h3 genes. 6 the test therefore simultaneously detects influenza a and determines the h1 or h3 subtype. since all seasonal influenza viruses in man over the past 20 years (prior to h5n1 in 2003 and swine influenza in 2009) have been either h1 or h3, the rvp test can effectively detect the presence of non-seasonal (non-h1, non-h3) virus by virtue of a positive matrix gene signal and negative h1 and h3 signals, a combination of results that flag a "new" influenza subtype and potential pandemic threat.the objective of the study was to demonstrate that the use of multiplex pcr tests such as the xtag ™ rvp test that use a combination of matrix and hemagglutinin gene targets can detect novel non-seasonal strains of influenza.the study was a laboratory based study using specimens from newly diagnosed h1n1 swine flu human cases and avian, swine and equine isolates of influenza a.the introduction of h1n1 swine flu this year provided a real life challenge for the rvp assay. the rvp test results for 20 confirmed cases of h1n1 swine influenza in four canadian cities in three provinces (nova scotia, ontario and british columbia) are shown in table 1 . all 20 individuals who presented with ili, had either recently returned from mexico or had an epidemiologic link to travelers to mexico, and were confirmed as positive for h1n1 a/swine/california/04/2009 by either the national microbiology laboratory in winnipeg, the ontario agency for health prevention and promotion in toronto, or the bccdc in vancouver using a combination of real time matrix gene pcr, real time pcr targeting the a/swine/california/04/2009 ha gene or by sequencing the ha gene. matrix gene signals for all 20 patients were positive (mean signal was 6,970 mfi) while the h1 and h3 signals were negative indicating the presence of a non-seasonal, non-h1, non-h3 influenza a virus.to further validate the ability of the rvp test to identify non-h1, non-h3 influenza viruses we tested 17 influenza a viruses representing 11 of the 16 ha subtypes and four untyped isolates. the influenza subtypes tested included both high pathogenicity and low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses isolated from four bird species (turkey, quail, mallard, chicken) in five countries (canada, italy, england, u.s.a., and vietnam), four swine and two equine viruses. the results show that all 17 viruses had a positive matrix signal (mean, 7,692) and negative signals for both h1 and h3 genes ( table 2) . for comparison, one h1 and two h3 seasonal influenza specimens gave readings of 8,716, 1,566, and 3,255 for the h1 and h3 targets, respectively. the rvp test also correctly flagged two h5n1 isolates as h5 subtypes (using unmasked software). these results indicate that the rvp test can distinguish between seasonal h1, h3 influenza and non-h1, non-h3, non-seasonal avian or animal influenza.the emergence of h1n1 swine influenza has provided a real life challenge for the rvp test to detect new pandemic strains. the xtag ™ rvp successfully flagged 20 out of 20 swine flu patients as having non-seasonal influenza while at the same time correctly identified seasonal influenza (8 h1n1 and 14 h3n2), 3 parainfluenza type 3, 6 rhino/enterovirus, 2 coronavirus 229e, and 1 metapneumovirus infections in hamilton during the month of april. by running the test daily as a sentinel test, we have been able to provide public health authorities with a probable swine flu result with a 24 h turn around time faster than that provided by our public health laboratories. while laboratories rush to build h1n1 swine flu specific assays, currently available molecular tests such as the xtag ™ rvp assay provide a solution for detecting swine flu cases in the absence of specific h1n1 swine flu tests. we believe that the rvp test if implemented in diagnostic algorithms can play an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza a viruses in patients presenting with ili and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats. background: since the turn of the century seven new respiratory viruses have infected man and two of these have resulted in worldwide epidemics. both sars coronavirus which quickly spread to 29 countries in february 2003 and h1n1 swine influenza that recently spread from mexico to 30 countries in three weeks represent major pandemic threats for mankind. diagnostic assays are required to detect novel influenza strains with pandemic potential. objective: in this report we evaluate the ability of a multiplex pcr test (xtag tm rvp) to detect new, "non-seasonal" influenza viruses including the h1n1 swine influenza a/swine/california/04/2009. study design: laboratory based study using retrospective and prospective specimens. results: this multiplex pcr test detected the present of non-seasonal (non-h1, non-h3) influenza in 20 of 20 patients infected with h1n1 swine flu virus. in addition to detecting the current swine flu the xtag tm rvp test detected the h5n1 a/vietnam/1203/2004 high pathogenicity avian influenza virus that circulated in south east asia in 2003 as well as 17 out of 17 influenza a viruses representing 11 ha subtypes isolated from birds, swine and horses not yet seen in the human population. conclusion: based on these results we believe that this molecular test can perform an important role as a sentinel test to detect novel non-seasonal influenza a viruses in patients presenting with influenza-like illness (ili) and therefore act as an early warning system for the detection of future pandemic influenza threats.© 2009 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.the current outbreak of swine influenza that

infections worldwide. in between, there have been continuous, relentless attacks from (re-)emerging viruses. to fully understand viral pathogenesis and develop effective medical countermeasures, we must strengthen current surveillance and basic research efforts.this year marks the centenary of the ''spanish flu'' pandemic, the most devastating viral pandemic in history caused by an h1n1 influenza a virus that infected over 500 million and killed between 50 and 100 million people. we know to expect a flu season every year; the question is always how severe it will be. with high numbers of influenza infections reported worldwide during this season, we are again reminded of the public health threat stemming from a potential influenza pandemic. the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) reported that this is the first time in the past 15 years that all states in the entire continental usa have reported widespread flu activity during the same week. in china, the reported number of flu cases have increased over 2-fold compared to the flu seasons in the past several yearsthe second-highest recorded number, just after the 2009 pandemic h1n1 (ph1n1)-and many patients have been hospitalized with severe clinical symptoms. these events have raised concerns that we are in danger of another flu pandemic. circulating flu viruses are quite diverse this year-including the ''swine flu'' 2009-ph1n1, h3n2, and influenza b/victoria and b/yamagata-and are spread across various geographical locations. the h3n2 subtype is dominant in the uk and the usa, but a mixed pool of ph1n1, h3n2, and influenza b/yamagata, with a small portion of b/victoria, have been reported in china. a universal influenza vaccine to combat such mutation-prone viruses is urgently needed yet still far from reach, despite the global efforts. despite best efforts to anticipate the emergent strains, vaccines vary from year to year in terms of efficacy, with this year's providing only moderate protection.human infections with different subtypes of avian influenza a viruses (aivs) have been consistently reported since h5n1 aiv was reported in hong kong during 1997 (yuen et al., 1998) . infections with aiv typically result in high case fatality rates (cfrs) ranging from 30% to 70%, and at least 14 influenza a virus subtypes-including the three seasonal flu viruses, h1n1, h2n2, and h3n2have reportedly infected humans to date ( figure 1 ). of note, influenza a virus has a segmented genome with 8 genomic segments encoding at least 10-16 proteins, two of which are hemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na). there are currently 16 (+2) ha genes and 9 (+2) na genes (+2 means two more ha or na from bat-derived influenza-like viruses, for which only genomic sequences are available, but no alive virus has yet been isolated; wu et al., 2014) . the combination of ha and na would theoretically yield 144 subtypes of hxny viruses. due to the migratory birds' travel and live poultry trade, which includes the transport of poultry and operation of live poultry markets (lpms) throughout china and southeast asia (gao, 2014) , we should expect more human infections with aivs in the future. aivs may supply genomic segments for reassortment with circulating seasonal influenza viruses to generate a novel pathogen with high cfr and pandemic potential. as we can't yet eradicate seasonal flu, efforts to change the traditional live poultry trade-for example, the traditional lpms-in order to restrict the flow of domestic poultry migration may help decrease the probability of the emergence of novel aiv subtypes, even the potential pandemic viruses.flu isn't alone. coronavirus is another family of emerging pathogens with public health concern. a devastating but quickly conquered outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) during 2003 transformed china's approach to outbreak control. a sophisticated surveillance system has since been put into place. while primarily government led, there is extensive collaboration with various institutes in the academic, industry, and healthcare fields to produce a wide-ranging, comprehensive network that issues warnings of an impending outbreak at the earliest opportunity. as exemplified by the chinese academy of sciences center for influenza research and early-warning (cascire) network, in addition to chinese national influenza center/who collaborating center for reference and research on influenza under china cdc, such a system can drive basic, applied, and translational research on infectious disease control and prevention (bi et al., 2017) . a related coronavirus, the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), emerged in the middle east during 2012 and has on occasion caused sporadic infections with imported cases from returning travelers, some of which go on to infect others. one such instance was the importation of a mers-cov case into china from south korea during 2015 (su et al., 2015) , in which the traveler was promptly identified and quarantined, preventing further infections. due to the ongoing nature of the mers-cov outbreak, we are likely to encounter more coronavirus infections in the future. preparations should be made accordingly through the development of both vaccines and antivirals.ebola virus (ebov), first identified in central africa during 1976, unexpectedly struck west africa during 2013-2015, impacting several countries in north america, europe, and africa. after earlier incidents, efforts were underway to develop vaccine candidates; however, these were challenged, as the virus was at first suspected to have a higher mutation rate that might negatively impact the efficacy of the ebov vaccine candidates under clinical trials (gire et al., 2014) . to address this question directly, a total of 175 whole-genome sequences were obtained from viral isolates, and the mutation rate was determined to be similar to that of past ebov outbreaks (tong et al., 2015) . therefore, current experimental vaccines should still be efficacious. during this epidemic, application of genomic sequencing technology greatly facilitated disease control. molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis studies, in addition to the development of effective antivirals, such as the zmapp antibody cocktail and the vesicular-stomatitis-virus (vsv)and adenovirus (ad5, chad3)-based vaccines, were the key measures for the effective control of these pathogens.while the world was still celebrating the success of finally conquering ebov after a protracted 2-year battle, zika virus (zikv) struck with the first cases reported in brazil after small outbreaks previously reported in micronesia (yap island) and french polynesia in 2007 and 2013, respectively ( figure 2 ). as an obscure pathogen (but known to humans since 1947), the zikv isolates from the 2015-2016 epidemic were found to possess new characteristics (grubaugh et al., 2018) . the virus quickly spread geographically with at least 84 countries/regions affected (figure 2) . a coordinated global response eventually led to the conclusion of the epidemic in november 2016, but long-term complications stemming from zikv infections are yet being reported from convalescent patients.after the zikv epidemic, outbreaks of yellow fever virus (yfv) occurred across angola and brazil in 2017. the virus was imported to china as chinese workers returned from angola (chen et al., 2016) . almost simultaneously, rift valley fever virus (rvfv) was also imported into china from angola through a returning traveler. these events highlighted the difficulty in accurately predicting the time and location, as well as the identity, of the causative pathogen behind the next outbreak. indeed, ebov and zikv were both considered neglected, tropical reemerging pathogens, sars-cov and mers-cov were novel, emerging pathogens, and influenza viruses were typically re-emerging pathogens with new properties derived from genetic evolution and reassortments.a myriad of contributing factors such as urbanization, globalization, and climate change will impact the pathogenicity and transmission of certain pathogens, as well as the distribution of their reservoir hosts. this reality places additional emphasis on the importance of proactive countermeasures, such as pathogen surveillance and vaccine development, as well as the need for reactive countermeasures, such as antiviral therapy.as a community of scientists, clinicians, public health experts, and caregivers, we have so far been able to answer the challenges posed by a spectrum of pathogens ranging from ''a''vian influenza virus to ''z''ika virus. each has taken time and a somewhat tailored approach. we can expect sterner tests in the future, and some of the lessons learned must be carried forward. since the spread of (re-) emerging viruses is not confined by geographic boundaries, it is clear that collaborative solutions across nations are needed to solve these global problems. efforts in this vein are getting off the ground. international partnerships, such as the global virome project (carroll et al., 2018) for virus hunting worldwide and the establishment of a cdc network in africa with assistance from the us cdc and china cdc, will greatly improve our capacity for surveillance, contributing to, ideally, a worldwide system in the ''big data'' era of the 21 st century. the pandemic emergency financing facility (pef), launched by the world bank in collaboration with the world health organization and the governments of japan and germany, aims to provide the numbers of human cases infected by different subtypes of influenza a virus reported worldwide are shown in histogram (who, 2017a) . the x axis presents the time points (year) of the first reported case for each subtype virus. the y axis presents the total numbers of reported human cases to date. the case numbers of human-infecting h1n1, h2n2, and h3n2 are extraordinarily large and are not available for exact counts due to influenza pandemics such as the 1918 h1n1 spanish flu, 1957 h2n2 asian flu, and 1968 h3n2 hong kong flu. over $500 million to cover developing countries against the risk of outbreaks. the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi), founded by the norway government, the bill & melinda gates foundation, the wellcome trust, and the world economic forum aim to provide a coordinated, bench-to-bedside approach for (pre-)clinical vaccine development and delivery. the above examples show that we are beginning to learn our lessons, but we must not forget that basic scientific research into both high-profile and obscure pathogens forms a crucial basis for the effective implementation of informed public health policies and innovative collaborative initiatives. robust investment into basic research (i.e., viral pathogenesis, interspecies transmission, etc.) should be encouraged to achieve a fully multi-faceted approach to combating future pandemics. as a type of alphacoronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) has caused enormous economic loss to the global pork industry, especially after the emergence of highly pathogenic pedv variant strains in 2010. pedv was first reported in 1971 in the uk [1] , and afterward was also discovered in europe and asia [2] [3] [4] [5] . although pedv has persisted in asian swine-producing countries, it does not attract enough global attention. after october 2010, severe ped outbreaks occurred even in chinese pig farms that were already vaccinated with cv777inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines [2, [6] [7] [8] . in 2013, the first pedv outbreak occurred in the us and rapidly spread across the entire country [9] . molecular epidemiological results show the genetic differences between classical (gi subtype) and new pedv variant strains (gii subtype) [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9] . pedv is presently recognized worldwide due to dramatic changes observed in its epidemic character, pathogenic properties, and gene drift [10] . studies focused on its pathogenesis [11, 12] , immune evasion [13] and developing effective vaccines [14, 15] are progressing.a virus is a non-cellular life form that must rely on cells to complete its life cycle. the first step in virus infection is successful entry into cells. most enveloped viruses enter cells through cellular endocytosis [16, 17] . the endocytic pathways utilized by viruses vary, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (cme), caveolaemediated endocytosis, lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, and macropinocytosis, among others. cme is the most classical and well-known endocytic pathway utilized by viruses. after binding to cell surface receptors, the virus is packaged by clathrin-coated pits (ccps) and transported to clathrin-coated vesicles (ccvs), in which virus particles as the "cargo" will be transported to the early endosomes [18, 19] . caveolae is a plasma-specific invagination structure with a diameter of 50-100 nm. when viral particles interact with receptors, caveolae coated with caveolin-1 invaginates and pinches off plasma membrane, then the caveolae vesicles mature into caveosomes and deliver "cargoes" to early endosomes [20, 21] . lipid raft are plasma membrane microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol that participate in the lateral organization of the cell surface. raft-mediated endocytosis is the process of internalization of ligands and receptors by these domains [22] .the mechanisms of some coronaviruses entry into cells have already been studied, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), murine hepatitis virus (mhv), and human coronavirus (hcovs). entry of sars-cov into hepg2 and cos7 cells is clathrindependent while entry into vero e6 cells is clathrin-and caveolae-independent [23, 24] , but the lipid raft plays an important role in the process [25] . mhv entry into cells needs clathrin [26] [27] [28] , the same as hcov-nl63 [29] . for hcov-229e, caveolae-mediated endocytosis is utilized to enter human fibroblast cells [30] . sars-cov and mhv-cov can induce continuous micropinocytosis, but this occurs in the later phase during infection and is not associated with virus entry [31] . coronaviruses enter host cells via various endocytic pathways after viral spike glycoprotein (s) interacts with receptors and then initiates the endocytic process. internalized viruses are trafficked like cargoes to membrane fusion sites through specific transport routes. different covs have varying fusion sites [32] . the fusion site of the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) takes place in the early endosome, while mhv and the feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv) are transported to the lysosome to fuse.although there have been many studies on the invasion mechanism of cov, the invasion strategy of pedv has not yet been fully elucidated. in 2014, park et al. [33] revealed that pedv entry followed clathrin-mediated endocytosis and was dependent on a low ph for successful entry into cells. in their research, one pedv strain was studied in vero cells in the presence of trypsin and only the chemical inhibitors and confocal method were used to reveal the pedv entry. however, there are still important questions to address. considering that covs take advantage of different pathways to enter cells, whether different subtypes of pedv invade cells by different ways and whether pedv enter different types of cells through different ways remains to be determined. to concretely clarify the entry and transportation routes of pedv, we used vero and ipec-j2 cells as models for pedv entry and chose cv777-like strain gds09 and highly pathogenic variant strain gds01 to compare the invasion strategies of different pedv subtypes. our results will advance the understanding of the pathogenesis and immune evasion of pedv.vero cells were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle medium (dmem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs, gibco) and antibiotics (100 u/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). ipec-j2 cells were grown in dmem/nutrient mixture f-12 (dmem/f12) supplemented with 5% fbs and antibiotics. the pedv strains used in this study were cv777-like strain gds09 (gi subtype, genbank id: mh726408.1) and highly pathogenic variant strain gds01 (gii subtype, genbank id: km089829.1). exogenous trypsin (10 μg/ml) was added to proliferate pedv strains in vero cells and 5 μg/ ml trypsin was added in ipec-j2 cells. sbti (soy bean trypsin inhibitor type i; sigma no. t6522). the endocytic inhibitors used included dynasore (sigma-aldrich, no. 324410), chlorpromazine (cpz, sigma-aldrich, no. c0982), methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβcd, sigma-aldrich, no. c4555), nystatin (sigma-aldrich, no. 475914), ammonium chloride (nh4cl, sigma-aldrich, no. a9434), and bafilomycin a1 (baf a1, sigma-aldrich, no. 196000). antibodies against clathrin heavy chain, caveolin 1, eea1, rab7, and lamp1 coupled with secondary goat anti-rabbit alexa fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse alexa fluor 594 were purchased from abcam. the mouse anti-pedv-s monoclonal antibody [34] and anti-pedv-n polyclonal antibody (prepared in our laboratory) were used in the immunofluorescence analysis and western blotting analysis, respectively. the overexpression plasmids of wild-type and mutant dynamin ii (gfp-dyn-wt and gfp-dyn-m), eps 15 (gfp-eps15-wt and gfp-eps15-m), and caveolin-1 (gfp-cav-wt and gfp-cav-m) were provided by prof. mark mcniven, mayo center for biomedical discovery (rochester, mn, usa).to investigate the trypsin dependency of pedv strains, vero cells were seeded in 6-well plates until confluence. after washed with pbs, cells were infected with pedv strains at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.5 with or without trypsin (10 μg/ml) or with trypsin and 25 μg/ml sbti for 12 h before the quantification of the viruses by qrt-pcr.to test the dynamics of pedv internalization, vero or ipec-j2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates until confluence. the cells were pre-chilled for 10 min and inoculated with pedv at a moi of 0.5 at 4 °c for 1 h for virus binding. the cells were washed three times with ice-cold pbs to remove unbounded viruses and immediately warmed to 37 °c to initiate internalization. after incubation for the indicated time intervals, the cells were treated with proteinase k (1 mg/ml) at 4 °c for 30 min and then washed with pbs to inactivate and remove the non-internalized pedv particles. the control cells were then washed with pbs. the cells were collected and subjected to qrt-pcr analysis [34] .to test the effect of inhibitors on pedv internalization, it was necessary to evaluate the cytotoxicity of cell inhibitors. the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 10 5 cell/well, grown for 24 h, and treated with endocytic inhibitors at the indicated concentration for 4 h. then 10 μl of cck-8 solution was added to each well and incubated at 37 °c for 1 h. an absorbance of 450 nm was measured. the experiments were repeated three times independently. the concentration of each used inhibitor did not cause significant cytotoxicity to the cell viability. to test the effect of inhibitors on pedv internalization, the cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of drugs for 1 h and then infected with gds01 or gds09 strains at moi = 1 in the presence of drugs for 1 h. after washing with citrate buffer (ph 3.0) [35] and pbs, the cells were incubated with medium containing trypsin for 6 h or 9 h at 37 °c and collected for qrt-pcr and western blotting analysis, respectively.the expression of pedv n protein was detected by qrt-pcr and western blotting with gapdh as the reference. total rna was extracted using trizol (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction and cdna was synthesized with a revertra ace qpcr rt master mix with gdna remover kit (toyobo, osaka, japan). qpcr reaction was performed using a sybr premix ex taq ii kit (takara, tokyo, japan) using a light cycler 480 real-time pcr system (roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in, usa). for the western blotting analysis [36] , the cells were washed with pbs and lysed in ripa lysis buffer on ice for 30 min. after sds-page electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) membrane via the semidry method and immunoblotted with the corresponding antibodies.transfection of vero cells and ipec-j2 cells with the overexpression plasmids of wild-type and mutant dynamin ii (gfp-dyn-wt and gfp-dyn-m), eps 15 (gfp-eps15-wt and gfp-eps15-m), and caveolin-1 (gfp-cav-wt and gfp-cav-m) were performed using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen) transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol. the cells were seeded in 12-well plates until 80% confluence. 24 h after transfection, the cells were infected with pedv at moi = 1 for 1 h. virus was moved with citrate buffer and pbs and replaced with fresh medium containing trypsin, and virus internalization was evaluated by confocal fluorescence microscope.for the rna interference assay, sirnas against dynamin ii (sidyn, sus scrofa: 5′-cac ctc atg atc aat aac a-3′, chlorocebus sabaeus 5′-cct aca tca aca cga acc a-3′), clathrin heavy chain (sichc, sus scrofa 5′-ccc ata cca tga ctg atg a-3′, chlorocebus sabaeus 5′-gat gaa cct tat gca tgc a-3′), eps 15 (sieps15, sus scrofa 5′-cct gtg gat att ctt gga a-3′, chlorocebus sabaeus

corresponding full-length mrna sequences of sus scrofa and chlorocebus sabaeus, sir-nas against rab7a (sirab7, 5′-gat ggt gga tga cag act a-3′), and vps39 (sivps39, 5′-gct tca aga gag act act a-3′) were designed and synthesized based on the corresponding mrna homologous sequences of sus scrofa and chlorocebus sabaeus. the control sirna (sicontrol) was designed and synthesized irrelevantly to all the known genes of sus scrofa and chlorocebus sabaeus genome, respectively, by ribobio (guangzhou, china). the cells were seeded in 12-well plates until 80% confluence. to ensure transfection efficiency, a second transfection was carried out at 24 h after the first transfection. at 48 h post-first transfection, the cells were infected with pedv at moi = 1 for 1 h. virus was moved with citrate buffer and pbs and replaced with fresh medium containing trypsin, and virus internalization was evaluated by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi, respectively.alexa-594 labeled transferrin (trf ) or alexa-555 labeled cholera toxin b subunit (ctb) were diluted at 1:500 and mixed with pedv at moi = 10. the cells were washed three times with pbs and added to the mixture of pedv and trf or ctb at 4 °c for 1 h and then incubated at 37 °c for 30 min for internalization. after washing with pbs, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, blocked, incubated with mouse anti-pedv-s monoclonal antibody, incubated with alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg (h + l), stained with dapi, and analyzed using a confocal fluorescence microscope. light exposure was avoided throughout this experiment.cells cultured in glass-bottom dishes for 12 h were washed with ice-cold pbs and incubated with pedv at 4 °c for 1 h. cold viruses were replaced with pre-warmed medium, and the cells were immediately shifted to 37 °c. at specific time points, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at rt for 15 min after washing three times with pbs. permeabilization was carried with 0.5% triton x-100 at rt for 15 min. after washing with pbs, the cells were blocked with 5% bsa in pbst at rt for 60 min to block unspecific binding sites. the specific primary antibodies against chc, eea1, caveolin-1, rab7, lamp1, and anti-pedv-s antibody were used to probe the cells at 4 °c overnight. the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit igg antibody conjugated to alexa fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse igg antibody conjugated to alexa fluor 594) at 37 °c for 1 h. fluorescent images were acquired using the light-scanning module of a leica tcs sp8 sted 3× confocal microscope.the cells (5 × 10 7 ) were incubated or not incubated with pedv at 37 °c for 1 h, washed three times with ice-cold pbs, and lysed in 1 ml tne buffer (25 mm tris, 150 mm nacl, 5 mm edta, and ph 7.5) containing 1% triton x-100 and 1% phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) on ice for 30 min. the homogenized cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °c for 5 min at 1000 g and the supernatant was mixed with isometric 1 ml containing 80% sucrose in tne buffer. the lysates-sucrose mixture was placed at the bottom of ultracentrifugal tubes and overlaid with 7 ml 30% and 3 ml 5% sucrose in tne buffer. the cell lysates were ultracentrifuged at 4 °c for 16 h at 20 000 g in a sw41 rotor (beckman). after centrifugation, twelve 1 ml fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the tubes. the fractions were concentrated with 6% peg at 4 °c overnight, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of tne buffer after centrifuging at 4 °c for 30 min at 10 000 g. the localizations of lipid raft-associated protein caveolin-1 and pedv n protein were analyzed by western blotting.all the graphs were created with graphpad prism 6 software. all the data are presented as the means ± standard deviations (sds) from at least three independent experiments. significance was estimated using one-way anova with multiple comparisons to control. p values less than 0.05 were defined as the threshold for statistical significance. p values between 0.05 and 0.01 were marked with one asterisk, p values between 0.01 and 0.001 were marked with two asterisks, p values between 0.001 and 0.0001 were marked with three asterisks, and p values less than 0.0001 were marked with four asterisks.coronavirus entry is inextricably linked with proteolytic processing of the s protein. in most cases, pedv is trypsin dependent. thus, we investigated the trypsin dependency of both strains used in our research. as shown in figure 1a , gds01 strain needed trypsin while gds09 strain is trypsin independent. so, we added trypsin in the following assays to explore the invasion mechanism of pedv.the dynamics of viruses invading different kinds of cells vary, and there may be differences among various subtypes of the same virus. thus, it is necessary to know the entry dynamics of pedv before studying the endocytic pathways. the cells were incubated with pedv at moi = 0.5 at 4 °c for adsorption and shifted to 37 °c to initiate internalization. the adsorbed but not internalized virions were removed with proteinase k, and the pedv invasion rates at different time points were detected using qrt-pcr. the invasion kinetics ( figure 1 ) showed that most of the pedv particles were detached from the cells by proteinase k at the beginning of invasion. after 60 min in the vero cells ( figure 1b ) and 45 min in the ipec-j2 cells ( figure 1c ), nearly maximum proportions of viral particles completed the internalization. approximately 95% of the pedv particles entered the vero cells, while only 30% entered the ipec-j2 cells. notably, the gds01 strain demonstrated less efficient invasion than the gds09 strain, but there was no significant difference.dynamin ii plays an essential role in cellular membrane fusion during vesicle formation due to its gtpase activity, and it is necessary for clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis [35, 37] . thus, we explored the essentiality of dynamin ii in pedv entry using specific chemical inhibitors, overexpression of domain-negative mutants of dynamin ii, and sirna interference. dynasore [38] , a cell-permeable non-competitive inhibitor of dynamin ii, was used to pre-treat cells at different concentrations to analyze the effect on pedv entry. the cytotoxicity test showed that 50 μm of dynasore had no effect on the viability of the vero and ipec-j2 cells (additional file 1).cells were pre-treated with 30 μm and 50 μm dynasore for 1 h before pedv infection. dmso was used as a negative control. the effect of dynasore on pedv entry was quantified by qrt-pcr at 6 hpi. pedv invasion was significantly inhibited by dynasore. at a concentration of 50 μm, the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains into the vero cells were approximately 17% and 12%, and the invasion rates into the ipec-j2 cells were 8% and 63%, respectively ( figure 2a) . a comparison of the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains indicated that the gds01 strain was more sensitive to dynasore than the gds09 strain when invading the ipec-j2 cells but there was no significant difference between them when invading the vero cells. many studies used the overexpression of dominant negative mutants to explore the role of dynamin ii in virus entry [39, 40] . mutation of dynamin ii from 44k to 44a can inhibit gtpase activity and reduce endocytosis [41] . cells were transfected with wild-type and mutant types of dynamin ii respectively and infected with gds01 and gds09 strains at 24 h after transfection. the confocal results showed that the vero and ipec-j2 cells overexpressing wild-type dynamin ii (gfp-dyn-wt) were infected with pedv while the cells overexpressing mutant dynamin ii (gfp-dyn-m) were barely infected ( figure 2b ). sirna interference was also used to identify the importance of dynamin ii on virus entry [23, 35, 42] . sus scrofa and chlorocebus sabaeus sirnas of dynamin ii (sidyn) were designed and synthesized. the interference efficiency of sirna on the dynamin ii expression in the vero and ipec-j2 cells was obvious at both the mrna and protein levels (additional file 1). cells were infected with pedv after transfection twice and the internalized virions were quantified at 6 hpi and 9 hpi by qrt-pcr and western blotting assay, respectively. the qrt-pcr results ( figure 2c ) showed that the knockdown of dynamin ii expression reduced the pedv internalization. the internalization rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains into vero cells were approximately 50% and 57%, the internalization rates into the ipec-j2 cells were approximately 48% and 60%, respectively, but there was no significant difference between the gds01 and gds09 strains in the two cells ( figure 2c ). the same results were confirmed by western blotting ( figure 2d ). taken together, the results suggested that pedv entry relies on dynamin ii.clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the most commonly used and classical endocytic pathway for virus entry. to identify whether pedv utilized cme to enter cells, we co-inoculated the vero and ipec-j2 cells with pedv and trf, which is the most typical biomolecule that uses cme to enter cells [43] . the co-inoculation results figure 1 trypsin-dependency and kinetics of pedv entry into cells. a vero cells were seeded in 6-well plates until confluence. cells were washed with pbs and infected with pedv strains (moi = 0.5) without trypsin or in the presence of trypsin (10 μg/ml) or trypsin and 25 μg/ml sbti. cells were collected for qrt-pcr at 12 hpi. b, c vero cells (b) and ipec-j2 cells (c) were incubated with pedv gds01 and gds09 strains, respectively, at 4 °c for 1 h and shifted to 37 °c immediately to initiate internalization. at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 min after incubation, the cells were treated with proteinase k (1 mg/ml) at 4 °c for 30 min to inactivate the non-internalized virions. the control cells were washed with pbs. the invasion rates were calculated by qrt-pcr analysis. ****p < 0.001.dynamin ii involved in pedv entry. a cells were pre-treated with 30 μm and 50 μm dynasore at 37 °c for 1 h, respectively, and incubated with gds01 or gds09 strain for 1 h. dmso was used as a negative control. the cells were collected at 6 hpi for qrt-pcr assay to test the invasion efficiency of pedv. b vero and ipec-j2 cells were transfected with gfp-dyn-wt and gfp-dyn-m, respectively, and infected with pedv strains at 24 h after transfection. the cells were fixed at 12 hpi and stained for confocal analysis. c, d vero and ipec-j2 cells were transfected with sidyn twice and infected with pedv strains at 24 h after the second transfection. the invasion rates of pedv into the cells were detected at 6 hpi and 9 hpi for qrt-pcr and western blotting analysis, respectively. ctrl means control. scale bars indicate 25 μm. **0.05 < p < 0.01; ***0.01 < p < 0.001; ****p < 0.001.showed that pedv co-located with trf in the two types of cells ( figure 3a ), which means that pedv might utilize clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter cells. to prove this conjecture, we used specific chemical inhibition, the overexpression of domain negative mutants of eps 15, the knockdown expression of chc and eps 15 by sirna, and the location of pedv in the cells to estimate the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in pedv entry. cpz is a specific chemical inhibitor used to block the cme pathway by preventing the assembly of ccps at the plasma membrane [44] . the cytotoxicity test showed that 30 μm cpz have no effect on the viability of the vero cells and 50 μm cpz have no effect on the viability of the ipec-j2 cells (additional file 2). vero and ipec-j2 cells were treated with cpz at different concentrations for 1 h and then infected with pedv. the internalization rates of pedv after cpz treatment were quantified by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi, respectively. the qrt-pcr results (figure 3b ) showed that pedv invasion was significantly inhibited by cpz. the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains at the highest drug concentrations were nearly 48% and 23% in the vero cells and 24% and 50% in the ipec-j2 cells, respectively. notably, there were no significant differences between the gds01 and gds09 strains in the vero cells but the gds01 strain was more sensitive than the gds09 strain in the ipec-j2 cells, reflecting the gds01 strain's significantly decreased invasion rates ( figure 3b ). the same results were also observed by western blotting ( figure 3c ) and ifa assay (additional files 3, 4) . the role of cme in endocytosis was also identified by the overexpression of gfp-tagged dominant negative mutants of eps 15 [45] . eps 15 is a critical component of ccps by interacting with adaptor protein 2 (ap-2), a major clathrin adaptor complex [46] . cells transfected with wild-type (gfp-eps15-wt) and mutant eps 15 (gfp-eps15-m) were infected with pedv strains at 24 h after transfection. the confocal results of the pedv invasion showed that the cells overexpressing wild-type eps 15 were infected with pedv while few infections were observed in the overexpressed gfp-eps15-m cells ( figure 3d ). sirna was also used to explore the role of cme in pedv entry by interfering with the expression of clathrin heavy chain (chc) and eps 15. chc and clathrin light chain form a triskelion shape, which is a key component for regulating the formation and disassembly of the clathrin lattice [47] . cells were infected with pedv strains after transfection twice, and the invasion rates of the viruses were assessed using qrt-pcr and western blotting assay at 6 hpi and 9 hpi, respectively. the quantitative experiments showed that knockdown of the expression of chc significantly reduced the invasion rates of pedv. the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains were 50% and 62% in the vero cells and 61% and 65% in the ipec-j2 cells, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the gds01 and gds09 strains ( figure 3e ). knockdown of the expression of eps 15 also significantly reduced the invasion rates of pedv. the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains were 61% and 65% in the vero cells and 51% and 66% in the ipec-j2 cells, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the gds01 and gds09 strains ( figure 3g ). the significant inhibition of sichc and sieps15 on pedv entry was also observed by western blotting assay (figures 3f, h) . to estimate whether pedv directly entered the cells through cme, we analyzed the localization of pedv and chc in the vero and ipec-j2 cells, respectively. pre-cooled cells were incubated with pedv at 4 °c for 1 h for adsorption and shifted to 37 °c for internalization. five min later, the cells were washed and fixed for observation using an ultrahigh-resolution laser confocal microscope. the confocal results showed that pedv particles co-located with chc protein in the vero and ipec-j2 cells ( figure 3i ), but some virions were not co-localized with chc. the results indicated that pedv can enter cells through the cme pathway, but cme may not be the only pathway utilized by pedv.cholesterol, an important component of cell membranes, embeds phospholipid bilayers and plays a crucial role in the fluidity of cell membranes [48] . many studies showed that most enveloped virus relied on cholesterol to invade cells [49, 50] . if a virus invades cells, depending on the presence of cholesterol, it will be sensitive to cholesterol extractants. mβcd can eliminate cholesterol on the plasma membrane of cells [51] . nystatin can bind to the cholesterol-enriched regions of cell membrane and then decompose cholesterol and impair cholesterol synthesis [52] . the cytotoxicity test showed that the maximum tolerance concentrations of vero and ipec-j2 cells to mβcd were 3 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively, and the maximum tolerance concentrations to nystatin were 30 μm and 50 μm, respectively (additional file 5). cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of mβcd and nystatin for 1 h, then infected with pedv. the effects of drugs on pedv entry were estimated by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi, respectively. mβcd showed a significant inhibition of pedv entry. the internalization rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains after mβcd treatment were approximately 4% and 6% in the vero cells and approximately 5% and 35% in the ipec-j2 cells. there were no significant differences between the gds01 and gds09 strains in the mβcd-treated vero figure 3 pedv entry relies on the cme pathway. a vero cells and ipec-j2 cells were incubated with mixture of alexa-594 labeled trf (red) and pedv (green) at 4 °c for 1 h, and then shifted to 37 °c for 30 min. the cells were fixed and stained for pedv using monoclonal antibody against pedv s protein. the cellular localizations of trf and pedv were observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope. light exposure was avoided throughout this process. b, c. the vero cells were pre-treated with 10 μm and 30 μm of cpz, and the ipec-j2 cells were pre-treated with 30 μm and 50 μm of cpz, respectively, at 37 °c for 1 h and incubated with gds01 or gds09 strains for 1 h. double-distilled water was used as a negative control. the cells were collected at 6 hpi and 9 hpi for qrt-pcr and western blotting assay, respectively, to test the invasion efficiency of pedv. d the vero cells (left) and ipec-j2 cells (right) were transfected with gfp-eps15-wt and gfp-eps15-m, respectively, and infected with pedv strains at 24 h after transfection. the cells were fixed at 12 hpi and stained for confocal analysis. e-h the vero cells and ipec-j2 cells were transfected with sichc and sieps 15 and infected with pedv strains at 24 h after the second transfection. the cells were collected at 6 hpi and 9 hpi for qrt-pcr and western blotting analysis, respectively. i the cells were pre-cooled at 4 °c for 15 min, incubated with pedv strains at 4 °c for 1 h, shifted to 37 °c for 5 min to initiate internalization, and washed for three times to remove un-internalized viral particles. the cells were fixed and stained with anti-pedv-s (red) and anti-chc (green) primary antibodies. ctrl means control. scale bars indicate 50 μm in a, 25 μm in d, and 5 μm in i. **0.05 < p < 0.01; ***0.01 < p < 0.001; ****p < 0.001. cells but in the ipec-j2 cells, the gds01 strain was more sensitive to mβcd ( figure 4a ). the results were confirmed by western blotting ( figure 4b ) and ifa assay (additional files 3 and 4). pedv entry was significantly inhibited by nystatin treatment. the internalization rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains after nystatin treatment were approximately 75% and 25% in the vero cells and approximately 65% and 45% in the ipec-j2 cells. the gds09 strain was more sensitive to nystatin than the gds01 strain in both the vero and ipec-j2 cells ( figure 4c ). the same results were confirmed by western blotting ( figure 4d ) and ifa assay (additional files 3 and 4). to further evaluate the importance of cholesterol, cells pre-treated with mβcd were supplemented with exogenous cholesterol and then infected with pedv, and the changes in the viral invasion rates were quantified by qrt-pcr at 6 hpi. the results showed that adding exogenous cholesterol could significantly increase the invasion rate of pedv. the average invasion rate of the gds01 and gds09 strains increased from 10% to over 90% in the vero cells and from 10% and 50% to approximately 95% in the ipec-j2 cells ( figure 4e ). the results indicated that pedv invading and entering cells depended on cholesterol but the two pedv subtypes showed different degrees of dependence on cholesterol when entering the vero and ipec-j2 cells.as both caveolae and lipid raft are rich in cholesterol, they are sensitive to cholesterol inhibitors [53, 54] . to identify whether caveolae-mediated endocytosis was involved in pedv entry, cells were co-inoculated with pedv and ctb, which entered the cells after interactions with specific receptors [55] . the localization results showed that pedv co-localized with ctb in vero and ipec-j2 cells ( figure 5a ), which means pedv may utilize caveolae-mediated endocytosis to enter cells. as the caveolae is mainly coated with caveolin-1 [56] , knocking down the expression and separating the interaction factors with caveolin-1 blocked the caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway. overexpression of the domain-negative mutant of caveolin-1 [57] blocked its interaction with the interaction factors. cells were transfected with wild-type caveolin-1 (gfp-cav-wt) and mutant caveolin-1 (gfp-cav-m), then infected with pedv at 24 h after transfection, and fixed for confocal observation at 12 hpi. the results showed that pedv infected gfp-cav-wt-overexpressing cells but barely infected gfp-cav-m-overexpressing vero or ipec-j2 cells ( figure 5b ). sirnas (sicav) were designed and synthetized to knockdown caveolin-1 expression. cells were transfected with sicav twice and then infected with pedv. after the second transfection, the invasion rates of pedv were measured by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi, respectively. the qrt-pcr results showed that the knockdown of caveolin-1 expression reduced the internalization of pedv. the inhibition rates in the gds01 and gds09 strains were 53% and 32% in the vero cells and 33% and 40% in the ipec-j2 cells, respectively (figure 5c) . compared with the gds09 strain, the gds01 strain showed a higher degree of reduction in the invasion rate in the vero cells but there was no significant difference in the ipec-j2 cells ( figure 5c ). the same results were confirmed by western blotting assay ( figure 5d ). to identify the role of caveolae in pedv entry, we investigated the cellular localization of pedv with caveolin-1. pre-cooled cells were incubated with pedv at 4 °c and then shifted to 37 °c for internalization. the cells were then washed and fixed for 10 min for observation with an ultrahigh-resolution laser confocal microscope. the cellular localization results showed that pedv was colocated with caveolin-1 in the vero and ipec-j2 cells ( figure 5e ). pedv can enter cells through the caveolaemediated pathway.if pedv can enter cells through the lipid raft pathway, the viral components should be contained in lipid raft enrichment layer after isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation [58] . after incubation with pedv, the cells were lysed and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. the products were extracted from the top down and a total of 12 fractions were obtained for western blotting analysis. caveolin-1 was used as the protein marker representing the lipid raft layer [58] . the results showed that pedv could be detected in the upper lipid raft enrichment layer. almost all the virions were concentrated in the lipid raft enrichment layer in the vero cells ( figure 6a ) and virions were detected in both the upper and lower components in the ipec-j2 cells ( figure 6b ). the differences between the gds01 and gds09 strains were the proportion of virions in the upper and lower components in the ipec-j2 cells. the gds01 particles were mainly present in the upper layer while amounts of gds09 particles were present in the lower layer (figure 6b) . the results indicated that pedv utilized lipid rafts to enter cells.viruses that enter cells via endocytosis are usually trafficked by endocytic vesicles to early endosomes for sorting and are transported to late endosomes or fused with early endosomes [59] . if viruses do not fuse in the early endosomes and release genomes into the cytoplasm, they will enter the late endosomes with the further acidification and maturation of the early endosomes. similarly, figure 4 pedv entry relies on cholesterol. a, b vero cells and ipec-j2 cells were pre-treated with 1.5 mm and 3 mm and 1 mm and 1.5 mm mβcd, respectively, at 37 °c for 1 h and incubated with gds01 or

antibody against s protein. the cellular localizations of ctb and pedv were observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope. light exposure was avoided throughout this process. b vero cells (up) and

the ph environment in the late endosomes does not meet the requirements for conformational changes of viral glycoproteins to cause membrane fusion, viruses will enter the lysosomes with the transportation of the late endosomes and finally achieve membrane fusion. viruses require acidic ph to traffic between endosomes. therefore, it is necessary to clarify whether pedv relies on a low ph environment. nh4cl is an inhibitor of endosome acidification [60] . baf a1 is a v-atpase inhibitor that can block the traffic of endocytic cargoes from early endosomes to late endosomes and inhibit the stability of low ph environments in the lysosome lumen [61] . cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of nh4cl and baf a1 (additional file 6) and infected with pedv (additional file 4). the invasion rates of pedv were measured by qrt-pcr and western blotting at 6 hpi and 9 hpi, respectively. the results showed that cells pretreated with nh4cl significantly inhibited pedv entry. the invasion rates in the gds01 and gds09 strains were approximately 30% and 15% in the vero cells and 50% and 73% in the ipec-j2 cells ( figure 7a ). this significant inhibition was also confirmed by western blotting (figure 7b ) and ifa assay (additional files 3 and 4). baf a1 can significantly inhibit pedv entry. the invasion rates in the gds01 and gds09 strains were approximately 75% and 5% in the vero cells and 41% and 30% in the ipec-j2 cells ( figure 7c ). western blotting ( figure 7d ) and ifa assay (additional files 3, 4) also confirmed the inhibition of baf a1. the results proved that pedv entry requires low ph.early endosomes mature into late endosomes by increasing intraluminal acidity through proton pump activity. late endosomes can become larger vesicles by fusing with the same type of endosomes, so they mostly exist in the form of a multivesicular body (mvb). late endosomes release rab5, incorporate rab7, and prepare to fuse with lysosomes [62] . to explore whether pedv particles are trafficked after internalization, we interfered with the expression of rab7 [63] involved in late endosomes and vps39 [32] involved in late endosometo-lysosome maturation and identified whether viral particles co-located with early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes. knockdown of the expression of rab7 (sirab7) can significantly inhibit the invasion efficiency of pedv. the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains were 49% and 51% in the vero cells and 82% and 38% in the ipec-j2 cells ( figure 8a) . similarly, the knockdown of the expression of vps39 (sivps39) also significantly inhibited the invasion efficiency of pedv. the invasion rates of the gds01 and gds09 strains were 68% and 56% in the vero cells and 45% and 50% in the ipec-j2 cells ( figure 8b ). for cellular location by pedv observation, pre-cooled cells were incubated with pedv at 4 °c and then shifted to 37 °c for internalization. the cells were washed and fixed at different time points after shift for observation using an ultrahigh-resolution laser confocal microscope. cellular localization assays showed that internalized pedv could co-locate with eea1, the early endosome protein marker, in the vero were incubated or not with pedv at 37 °c for 1 h and then lysed in tne buffer containing 1% triton x-100 and 1% pmsf on ice for 30 min. after mixing with isometric 80% sucrose, the homogenized cell lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation after being overlaid with 30% and 5% sucrose. after centrifugation, a total of 12 fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the tubes. the localizations of the lipid raft-associated protein caveolin-1 and pedv n protein were analyzed by western blotting after being concentrated with 6% peg6000. and ipec-j2 cells 30 min after endocytosis ( figure 8c ) and could co-locate with rab7, the late endosome protein marker, 40 min after endocytosis ( figure 8d ), while the late endosomes were mostly in the form of mvb. colocalization of pedv with lamp1 (lysosomal associated membrane protein 1), an important lysosome membrane component, was also observed 50 min after endocytosis in the two types of cells ( figure 8e ). the results demonstrated that pedv was trafficked to the lysosomes after entering the cells through endocytosis, and there were no differences between the two pedv genotypes and cells.since highly pathogenic variant strains emerged in 2010, pedv has attracted global attention. many studies have reported that vaccines based on cv777 or cv777-like strains have low protection efficiency against re-emerging variant strains [3, 4, [6] [7] [8] . genotyping showed that pedv strains can be sorted into two genotypes, gi subtypes (classical) and gii subtypes (variant). the nucleotide sequence of s1 subunit of s protein is 75-90% similar between gi and gii, which shows high variability [10, 64] . as the main antigen of pedv, the s protein incubated with gds01 or gds09 strains for 1 h. double-distilled water was used as a negative control. the cells were collected 6 hpi and 9 hpi for qrt-pcr and western blotting assay, respectively, to test the invasion efficiency of pedv. c, d the

viral entry. mutation of the s gene may lead to different mechanisms of virus invasion, which may help elucidate the pathogenesis and immune evasion of pedv. as sars-cov utilizes varying endocytic routes to invade different cells [23, 24] , we wondered whether pedvs can enter cells through different pathways. burkard et al. clarified that coronavirus entered cells through the endosome/lysosome pathway and was proteolytic dependent. the furin cleavage site just upstream of the fusion peptide (fp) of the s protein was the key to determining the fusion site of the viral membrane [32] . while the s protein of pedv does not have the furin cleavage site, a conserved arginine just upstream of the putative fp as the potential cleavage site can be cleaved by trypsin [65] . whether the theory mentioned above is applicable to pedv thus needs further study. here, we explored the gi and gii subtype pathways of pedv entry into vero and ipec-j2 cells, respectively, and the transportation route after internalization. our results showed that two the subtypes of pedv utilized clathrin-, caveolae-, and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis to enter the vero and ipec-j2 cells, but the utilization efficiency of each endocytic pathway varied depending on the different genotypes and types of cells.to describe the dynamic curve of pedv entry, the appropriate viral scavenger is extremely important to remove virus particles effectively adsorbed on the cell surface. we compared the effects of citrate buffer (ph 3.0) with proteinase k (1 mg/ml), and the latter exhibited a stronger capacity to remove viruses. the results of dynamic invasion showed that the virus invaded vero cells 100% within 60 min, while the invasion efficiency of the ipec-j2 cells was only approximately 30%. although ipec-j2 cells are considered the host cells of pedv, the cell lines cultured in vitro lost their polar growth state in vivo [66] , which possibly affects the viral recognition and reduces the infection efficiency of the virus. gds01 showed a lower invasion rate than gds09, but there was no significant difference.dynamin ii, a gtpase, plays an important role in endocytosis by pinching the endocytic vesicles off the plasma and is necessary in clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. we found that pedv entry is dynamin iidependent, although the sensitivity of the gds01 and gds09 strains to dynasore varied. considering the low specificity of chemistry inhibitor, dominant negative mutant and sirna-mediated knockdown of dynamin ii were carried out to evaluate dynamin ii for pedv infection. both the gds01 and gds09 strains were inhibited by sidynamin ii with no significant difference.clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a classical and commonly used pathway for most enveloped viruses. many coronaviruses use cme to enter cells, such as sars-cov entry into hepg2 cells and cos7 cells and phev entry into neuro-2a cells [23, 35] . to ascertain whether pedv utilized cme to enter cells, the chemistry inhibitor cpz was used to prevent clathrin assembly and further block cme. clathrin is composed of light chain (clc) and heavy chain (chc) which form clathrin lattices under the interaction of ap-2 and eps 15. both cpz pre-treatment and sirna-mediated knockdown of chc and eps 15 can significantly reduce the invasion rate of pedv into cells, with no significant difference between the gds01 and gds09 strains. dominant negative mutants can provide a more specific method to study endocytic pathways by separating the prototype protein from their interaction regulatory factors. in this study, we also showed that cells overexpressing dominant negative mutant of eps 15 were barely infected with pedv but cells overexpressing wild-type eps 15 were infected as normal. however, the inhibition of endocytosis by overexpressing dominant negative mutants may be compensated through other clathrin-independent endocytic pathways. when viruses enter cells through cme, they are carried by clathrincoated vesicles. co-localization of viral particles and chc indicated that pedv entry relies on cme.although caveolae and lipid rafts have the same components, such as caveolin-1, gm1, and cholesterol, they are two completely different endocytic pathways. before investigating whether pedv can use these two pathways to enter cells, we first examined whether pedv invasion depends on cholesterol. the cholesterol inhibitors nystatin and mβcd had significant inhibitory effects on pedv entry. nystatin had higher inhibitory effects on gds09 entry than gds01. the inhibitory effects of mβcd on vero cells were similar for gds09 and gds01 strains. mβcd effects were lower on gds09 than gds01 in ipec-j2 cells. we hypothesized that gds01 cell invasion mainly depended on cholesterol on the cell surface, while gds09 depended on the presence of cholesterol on the cell surface and cholesterol synthesis. exogenous cholesterol supplementation also confirmed the importance of cholesterol in pedv entry. endocytic vesicles formed in the caveolae-mediated pathway were coated with caveolin-1, which plays a critical role in the process. dominant negative mutant, rna interference, and the cellular co-localization of caveolin-1 with viral particles provided further evidence that pedv entry needed caveolin-1. collectively, both subtypes of pedv entered the vero and ipec-j2 cells through caveolae-mediated endocytosis. however, park et al. [33] showed that pedv entry was independent of caveolae-coated pit assembly by treating vero cells with nystatin. the different results may be explained by different operational details. firstly, nystatin was used before and during the incubation of pedv in this study, while only before incubation in the research of park et al. the concentrations of nystatin used in the two studies were different. the highest concentration of nystatin used in park's research was 20 μm [33] , while the highest concentration we used was 30 μm in vero cells. when the concentration is 10 μm, nystatin does not inhibit the entry of pedv, which is consistent with park's results. secondly, park et al. added methyl cellulose to block second-cycle infection [33] , while we added nothing except trypsin in medium. whether these reasons cause two different results needs further study.lipid raft acted as a platform for cell signal transduction and viral invasion, distributed in an island form on the plasma membrane of cells, and was isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. western blotting analysis showed that pedv n protein located in the lipid raft (upper layer) with caveolin-1 in the cells. as shown in figure 6b , pedv n protein is also present in the bottom layer when infected with ipec-j2 cells, which may be due to the different composition of the plasma membranes of the two kinds of cells.we demonstrated that pedv gi subtype gds09 and gii subtype gds01 strains could enter vero and ipec-j2 cells via the clathrin-, caveolae-, and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis pathways. furthermore, we also found that the invasion efficiency of the two strains was different with different endocytosis pathway. these differences between gds01 and gds09 strains may be due to the difference of s gene especially the s1 region of s gene (homology was about 92%), which is responsible for cell entry and membrane fusion by binding with receptor. the difference of gene may lead to the difference of binding ability or affinity between s protein and receptor, thus leading to the different utilization or initiation efficiency of different endocytosis pathways. however, whether the different gene sequence causes different invasion efficiency between gds01 and gds09 strains needs further study.after internalization, viral particles are transported by specific endosomes for membrane fusion. the classical transit route is the endo-/lysosomal pathway, in which endocytic cargoes are transported along endocytic vesicles, early endosomes, and late endosomes-lysosomes. park et al. have confirmed that nh 4 cl and baf-a1 could inhibit pedv entry [33] , which is consistent with our results, but needs to be confirmed by different methods. in this study, in addition to chemical inhibitors, we also used sirna interference and cellular localization of virus particles to identify the role of ph and endosomes. the results of this study revealed that pedv entry relied on low ph, which means that internalized pedv particles are transported to endosomes and lysosomes, as demonstrated by the co-localization of viral particles with eea1, rab7, and lamp1. liu et al. [67] reported that pedv s protein was activated by lysosomal cysteine proteases to activate pedv entry. however, based on the data, we could not conclude that membrane fusion occurred at the lysosomes; more technical methods are necessary to demonstrate the mechanism.in conclusion, studying the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of pedv are important to understand viral pathogenesis and benefit to the development of future therapies strategies. this study demonstrated that both the gi and gii subtypes of pedv enter vero and ipec-j2 cells via the clathrin-, caveolae-, and lipid raft-mediated endocytosis pathways, but the efficiency of each endocytosis pathway varies depending on the different genotypes and types of cells. the internalized pedv entered the lysosomes through the early and late endosomes. the results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the further understanding of pedv pathogenesis to find new targets of antiviral drugs.in addition to pandemic covid-19 virus infections, influenza virus remains a major threat to public health and causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide from annual seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics [1, 2] . according to who, seasonal influenza affects 5-10% of the global population annually and results in 3-5 million hospitalizations and about half a million deaths per year. pandemic influenza a virus (iav) represents an even greater concern. due to the rapid mutation rate of human iavs, antigenically novel viruses are emerging periodically, which are difficult to predict, prevent, or treat [3] . zoonotic influenza viruses of h5n1, h9n2 and recently, h7n9 and h10n8 subtypes have been identified as potentially pandemic [4, 5] .influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviridae family and comprise negative-sense, single stranded, segmented rna genome. the rna genome segments are loosely encapsidated by the nucleoprotein into virus particle. there are four types of influenza virus-types a, b, c, and d. influenza a viruses (iav) and type b viruses are clinically relevant for humans.iav are further sub-divided based on the antigenic properties of surface glycoproteins into 18 hemagglutinin (ha) and 11 neuraminidase (na) subtypes. only a few iav subtypes have been known to infect humans, while the majority of them are harbored in their natural hosts such as waterfowl, shorebirds, and other species [6] . cases of h7n9 human infections caused by an avian-origin h7n9 virus emerged in eastern china in march 2013 [7, 8] . this novel virus has immediately raised pandemic concerns as historically, pandemics were caused by the introduction of new subtypes into immunologically naïve human populations [9] . phylogenetic results indicate that novel h7n9 virus was a triple reassortant derived from avian influenza viruses [7] . since 2013, surveillance of live poultry figure 1 . phylogenetic tree of hemagglutinin (ha) sequences derived from human h7n9 viruses [15] . the evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method with kimura distances. five major clusters are shown as a collapsed branch. a/netherlands/219/2003 is defined as an outgroup. the yangtze river delta and pearl river delta lineages are circulating in china. hpai h7n9 viruses, which harbor multiple basic amino acids in the ha cleave site, are included in the yangtze river delta lineage. permission: viruses https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020149. [15] . the evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method with kimura distances. five major clusters are shown as a collapsed branch. a/netherlands/219/2003 is defined as an outgroup. the yangtze river delta and pearl river delta lineages are circulating in china. hpai h7n9 viruses, which harbor multiple basic amino acids in the ha cleave site, are included in the yangtze river delta lineage. permission: viruses https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020149. a fatality rate of up to 38% was reported for h7n9 viruses [16] , which highlights the need for a safe and effective vaccine [17] . several candidate h7n9 vaccine viruses have been prepared and listed by who (table 1) . these candidate vaccine viruses are available to vaccine developers for the preparation of h7n9 vaccine in the case of a pandemic. the majority of current vaccine manufacturers prepare vaccines either as split subvirions or live-attenuated viruses, and they are mostly dependent on fertilized chicken eggs as production "bioreactors". this technology is unlikely to meet the vaccine production demand during the rapid pandemic spread [18] . scalability issues (one vaccine dose/egg), the relatively long 6-month time period from strain isolation to final dose formulation and the requirement of biosecurity facilities for hpai are the major obstacles for egg-based production [19] . in addition, iav can acquire adaptive mutations when grown in eggs, which can interfere with the vaccine performance and efficacy. according to the action plan published by who in 2006, more than 2.34 billion monovalent vaccine doses will be needed in the case of a global pandemic, which justifies the development of novel technologies capable of supporting surge demand for pandemic influenza vaccine within a short period of time [20] . recently, several new platform technologies including recombinant vlps have been developed in order to facilitate the scale-up of vaccine production including overcoming the drawbacks of the egg-based vaccine production method. the first recombinant influenza vaccine flublok based on ha antigen has received fda approval [22] . the surface envelope glycoproteins such as influenza ha and na generally are viewed as the primary targets for vaccine development. ha currently represents the major target for vaccine development including approved and experimental vaccines [22] . recombinant ha-based vaccines have been shown to be efficacious against influenza including h7n9 [17, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . experimental na-based vaccines have been reported [32, 33] . the induction of immune responses against the surface envelope proteins has advantages, because virus-neutralizing antibody response to the viral envelope proteins can prevent early steps of viral infection. human monoclonal antibodies targeting the ha glycoprotein can neutralize h7n9 influenza virus [34] . importantly, the neutralizing antibodies protected against a/shanghai/2/2013 (h7n9) virus challenge [35] .the novel recombinant vlp vaccine platforms included vlps prepared in mammalian, insect, and plant expression systems. recombinant vlps are morphologically and biochemically similar to the wild type influenza virus ( figure 2) ; however, they lack viral genetic material and are unable to replicate and cause infection. table 2 shows examples of various vlps prepared from h7n9 virus antigens. cell culture-based production of vlps can potentially overcome limitations of classic influenza vaccines [36] . as vlps closely resemble viruses, they contain immunological epitopes in the natural conformation, are highly immunogenic, but they are non-infectious because they are prepared in the absence of viral genomic rna segments. each vlp represents a repetitive and highly organized molecular array of antigens displayed on the vlp surface. vlps have been shown to be better immunogens than subunit vaccines because of their self-adjuvant properties [51] . the antigens present in vlp bind pattern recognition receptors on innate immune effector cells and trigger the innate immunity of host cells [52, 53] . the molecular arrays displayed on vlp's surface are also potent inducers of type 2 t-independent b-cell response [54] . cryo-electron microscopy of vlps from 1918 pandemic influenza virus demonstrated a uniform distribution of ha molecules on the surface of vlps along with prefusion state confirmation [55] . two types of spike on the surface of virus are formed by trimers of ha and tetramers of na. it has been estimated that a spherical influenza virion of average diameter 120 nm has ~375 spikes [56] .the recombinant platforms using either mammalian, insect, or plant cells have many potential advantages including scalability and intrinsic safety, especially for hpai viruses such as h7n9 ( table  2) . mammalian cells, such as mdck, vero and perc.c6 cell lines have been extensively studied and applied to influenza vaccine production. the use of vlps expressed from mammalian cell platform has advantages for vlp production such as flexibility and a similar glycosylation pattern to the human virus. in some reports, vlps expressed from hek293t cells containing ha and na proteins on their surface with a ha:na ratio of 1:1, which is higher than natural influenza viruses, where the ha:na ratio is 4:1 [57] . vlps isolated from hek293sf cells were also characterized by nano-lc-ms/ms analysis to identify the protein cargo. nucleolin was the most abundant cellular protein present in vlps, in addition to the recombinant influenza vlp proteins [58] . however, production of vlps in mammalian cell expression system is difficult to scale up to the commercial scale, especially when using the transient transfection method. this limitation can be addressed by preparing stable cell line of corresponding genes. for example, a stable cell line expressing h1 and n1 genes under [49] mld 50 , mouse median lethal dose.viruses 2020, 12, 518as vlps closely resemble viruses, they contain immunological epitopes in the natural conformation, are highly immunogenic, but they are non-infectious because they are prepared in the absence of viral genomic rna segments. each vlp represents a repetitive and highly organized molecular array of antigens displayed on the vlp surface.

recombinant platforms using either mammalian, insect, or plant cells have many potential advantages including scalability and intrinsic safety, especially for hpai viruses such as h7n9 (table 2) . mammalian cells, such as mdck, vero and perc.c6 cell lines have been extensively studied and applied to influenza vaccine production. the use of vlps expressed from mammalian cell platform has advantages for vlp production such as flexibility and a similar glycosylation pattern to the human virus. in some reports, vlps expressed from hek293t cells containing ha and na proteins on their

analysis to identify the protein cargo. nucleolin was the most abundant cellular protein present in vlps, in addition to the recombinant influenza vlp proteins [58] . however, production of vlps in mammalian cell expression system is difficult to scale up to the commercial scale, especially when using the transient transfection method. this limitation can be addressed by preparing stable cell line of corresponding genes. for example, a stable cell line expressing h1 and n1 genes under the cumate inducible promoter was generated to create 293ha-na cells. plasmid with either gag or m1 gene was transiently transfected in 293ha-na cells and vlp yield was compared with gag or m1 protein. 293ha-na cells produced seven times more ha and na with gag plasmid transfected cells than its counterpart matrix m1-encoding plasmid [59] . gag vlps produced by this approach elicited strong antibody response and provided complete protection against the homologous virus strain. optimization of cell density at the time of induction in inducible stable hek293 cell lines also increased vlp yield by five-fold [60] .insect cells such as sf9 can be maintained in serum-free suspension cultures and have been often used to prepare recombinant vlps including h7n9. when influenza vlps were compared between insect sf9 cells and mammalian hek293 suspension cells, thompson et al. found that sf9 cells produce approximately 35 times more vlp than hek293 cells [61] . vlps produced from sf9 cells also showed higher ha titer and more homogenous vlps than hek293 cells derived vlps [61] . as expected, the high titer of baculovirus vector was also present in vlps prepared in sf9 cells. however, vlps generated in hek293 cells contained extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes and microvesicles. vlps produced from sf9 insect cells may have a safety advantage over other expression system because insect cells are unlikely to contain human pathogens, and baculovirus vector cannot replicate in human cells. vlps produced from insect cells show higher yields as compared to mammalian cell-produced vlps, which is beneficial for commercial production. in the above study, sf9 cells produced up to 35 times higher yield than the hek293 cells' expression system [61] . in addition, vlps had higher ha activity and they were more homogenous in morphology and size than mammalian cells produced vlps [61] . sf9 cells are usually maintained in a serum free, animal product-free medium. some of the chemical compounds known as m2 inhibitors, such as amantadine-enhanced expression of ha protein in vlps by seven-fold in sf9 expression system [62] . however, the challenge for vlps expressed using viruses 2020, 12, 518 6 of 18 baculovirus expression system is that it is difficult to separate vlps from the baculovirus expression vector during vaccine manufacturing.h7n9 vlps have been prepared from the full-length ha, na, and matrix m1 genes in sf9 cells. the h7 ha was derived from a/shanghai/2/2013 (h7n9) virus, while both na and m1 proteins were derived from a/puerto rico/8/1934 (h1n1) virus, a standard donor virus that is often used for preparation of influenza reassortant viruses used in human influenza vaccine production [63] . vlps have been isolated from sf9 cells and their morphology resembling native h7n9 virus envelope was confirmed.in another study, recombinant h7n9 vlp vaccine was prepared from ha and na derived from the a/anhui/1/2013 (h7n9) virus and the matrix m1 protein derived from the h5n1 virus (a/indonesia/05/2005) [42] . as control vaccines, vlps were prepared from a/chicken/jalisco/cpa1/2012 (h7n3) and a/indonesia/05/2005 (h5n1) viruses. the h7n9 vlps elicited hemagglutination-inhibition (hai) antibody response against the homologous h7n9 virus, cross-reactive hai against the heterologous h7n3 virus, and three-to four-fold higher hai response if vlps were administered with iscomatrix™ saponin-based adjuvant. similarly, all doses of h7n9 vlp elicited anti-na antibody, with three-to four-fold higher responses measured in the corresponding iscomatrix subgroups. a lethal murine wild-type a/anhui/1/2013 (h7n9) challenge demonstrated 100% survival of all animals receiving h7n9 or h7n3 vlp vaccines, versus 0% survival in a(h5n1) vaccine and placebo groups [42] .another study reported a vlp from sf9 cells that consisted of ha, na and m1 proteins derived from the human isolate a/taiwan/s02076/2013(h7n9) as a potential vaccine. in animal experiments, balb/c mice and specific-pathogen-free chickens receiving the vlp immunization developed hai serum titer and antibodies against na and m1 proteins [45] .the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a h7n9 vlp vaccine were evaluated in the ferret challenge model considered the most appropriate animal model for influenza [31] . purified recombinant h7n9 vlps morphologically resembled influenza virions and elicited high-titer serum hai and neutralizing antibodies to a/anhui/1/2013 (h7n9) virus. h7n9 vlp-immunized ferrets were challenged with homologous virus. after challenge, vlp-vaccinated animals displayed reductions in fever, weight loss, and virus shedding as compared to the same parameters in the unimmunized control ferrets. h7n9 vlp was also effective in protecting against lung and tracheal infection. the addition of either iscomatrix or matrix-m1 adjuvant further improved immunogenicity and protection of the vlp vaccine against h7n9 virus [31] .another recombinant influenza vaccine was developed by expressing h7 from h7n9 (a/shanghai/2/2013) on the surface of recombinant baculovirus. although this approach would not result in a typical influenza vlp morphology, the spatial conformation of h7 in the resulting vaccine is expected to be similar to that in an influenza virion or in a cognate vlp. mice were immunized twice, either intranasally or subcutaneously, with the vaccine. the immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy of the vaccine were evaluated against h7n9 or h7n7 subtype challenges. the authors concluded that intranasal administration of h7 protein expressed on the baculovirus envelope can be an alternative way to prime the immune system against influenza infection during a pandemic situation [64] . recently, a baculovirus vaccine expressing the ha of h7n9 strain a/chicken/jiaxing/148/2014 was prepared [65] . the recombinant baculovirus-ha generated in this study showed favorable growth characteristics in insect cells, good safety profile, and induced high-level hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer. moreover, this vaccine demonstrated better efficacy than inactivated whole-virus vaccine jx148, provided complete protection of chickens against challenge with hpai h7n9 virus, and effectively inhibited viral shedding.plant-based vlp vaccines can be produced from agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of influenza ha proteins in nicotiana benthamiana. plant-made h1 or h5 vlps mimicked the structure of influenza virions to some extent, they are immunogenic and elicit both humoral and cellular responses [66, 67] . each ha-only particle contains 30-50 homo-trimer ha incorporated into lipid bilayer envelope of plant cell origin [68] . plant-based recombinant vlp vaccines elicited humoral and cellular responses and protected against challenges. for example, a plant-derived vlp vaccine based on the ha of influenza h7n9 a/hangzhou/1/2013 was prepared, with no other influenza proteins included in the vaccine. the immunogenicity of such h7-only vlp vaccine was assessed in mice and ferrets after one or two intramuscular dose(s) with, and without, adjuvant (alum or gla-se™). in ferrets, h7-specific cell-mediated immunity was also evaluated. the mice and ferrets were challenged with h7n9 a/anhui/1/2013 influenza virus. a single immunization with the adjuvanted vaccine elicited a strong humoral response and protected mice against an otherwise lethal challenge. two doses of unadjuvanted vaccine significantly increased humoral response and resulted in 100% protection with significant reduction in clinical signs, leading to nearly asymptomatic infections. in ferrets, a single immunization with the alum-adjuvanted h7 vlp vaccine induced strong humoral and cmi responses with antigen-specific activation of cd3(+) t cells. this plant-made h7 vaccine therefore induced protective responses after either one adjuvanted or two unadjuvanted doses [39] . potentially, the plant-based transient expression system can allow the production of vlp structures, which contain ha only, without other influenza proteins.the recombinant ha-only h7 vaccine against h7n9 virus has been also prepared in insect cells [30] . the study has shown that purified ha formed rosette-shaped nanoparticles of approximately 30-50 nm in diameter [69] . similarly, subviral particles containing the full-length h7 rha (a/anhui/1/2013 (h7n9) were isolated from sf9 cells treated with mild detergent [38] . similarly to a previous study [30] , purified rha formed particulate structures; the particles were approximately 20 nm in diameter, exhibited hemagglutination activity, and consisted of approximately 3-4 trimers of the full-length ha molecules.as noted above, immunization with vlps have shown promising results in protecting from influenza infections with h7n9 [27, 70, 71] (table 2) . potentially, antibody induced by vlps can be more effective than those of subunit vaccines containing recombinant protein antigens [72] . in addition, experimental vlp vaccines generally show higher protective rates to high-risk groups such as children and the elderly [26] . however, the full spectrum of factors affecting immunogenicity of vlps requires additional studies. for example, it has been shown that amino acid residues of ha that are related to receptor specificity can affect the protective efficacy of h5n1 and h7n9 vaccines in mice [44] . h7n9 vlp vaccine that contained l226 (mammalian specificity) and g228 (avian specificity) in ha showed better immunogenicity and protection efficacy than vlp containing ha with either l226 + s228 or q226 + s228. this observation indicated that specific ha residues could enhance a vaccine's protection efficacy and ha glycoproteins with both avian-type and human-type receptor specificities may produce better pandemic influenza vaccines for humans [44] .while inactivated vaccines have been shown to induce predominantly systemic humoral response, vlp vaccines stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses. h7n9 vlps secreted from 293t cells triggered both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. this vaccine produced higher levels and antibody and isotypes of igg, as well as cross-reactive hai titer against heterologous h1n1 and h1n3 subtypes [43] .the presence of na and potentially other iav proteins in vlp could be beneficial. the na was demonstrated to protect host from influenza infection [73] . mice immunized with na vlps (without ha) were protected against lethal challenge of homologous a/pr/8/34 virus without any weight loss [74] .furthermore, both the exterior and interior of vlps can be altered to enhance their stability and immunogenicity. various adjuvants such as alum, cpg dna, monophosphoryl lipid a (mpl), poly ic, gardiquimod, cholera toxin (ct) can be encapsulated into vlps by exogenous and endogenous methods [75, 76] . these adjuvanted vlps show higher levels of antibodies in both sera and mucosa. in another study, adjuvants that stimulate tlr3 or nlpr3 pathways showed higher efficiency of influenza vlp vaccine in aged group of mice [77] . the cpg-adjuvanted intranasal immunization with an egg-derived split h7n9 vaccine offered a high level of protection against h7n9 infection in mice [78] .two phase i clinical trials of experimental h7n9 vlp vaccines with, and without, adjuvant have been completed, nct01897701 and nct02078674. the first study enrolled 284 adults (≥18 years of age) in a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [79] . interestingly enough, significant increases in n9 neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies occurred in up to 71.9% of recipients of the vaccine without adjuvant, 92.0% of recipients of vaccine with 30 units of adjuvant, and 97.2% of recipients of vaccine with 60 units of adjuvant. remarkably, the vaccines that were studied were released for human use within 3 months after the availability of the ha and na sequences. this illustrates the possibility of rapid response to the public health emergency situations, such as in the case of pandemic influenza outbreaks, as well as other health emergencies such as the ongoing covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.in another previously reported phase i clinical trial, subjects vaccinated with two doses of an unadjuvanted h7n9 vlp vaccine responded poorly (15.6% seroconversion rates with 45 µg ha dose). in contrast, 80.6% of subjects receiving h7n9 vlp vaccine (5µg ha) with iscomatrix adjuvant developed hai responses [80] . the results suggest that adjuvants can be important component for the development of safe and effective h7n9 human vaccines [81] .plant-derived quadrivalent seasonal vlp vaccine has been evaluated and elicited cross-reactive antibody and t cell response in healthy adults [82] . although h7n9 antigens have not been included in this study, the confirmed safety profile of vlp in humans suggests an attractive alternative manufacturing method for producing effective and ha-strain matching influenza vaccines.current annual vaccines (inactivated, live attenuated, and recombinant subunit) protect from circulating, antigenically matching iav and influenza b virus strains. broad protection is difficult to achieve because of the frequent emergence of new strains [83] . therefore, current approved and experimental vaccines have limited protection against antigenically mismatched variants and newly emerging viral strains. for new strains, antigenically matching new vaccines have to be developed within short periods of time. therefore, vaccines are needed that can protect from an antigenically divergent strain, especially from potentially pandemic viruses with a new ha subtype. in addition to h7n9 virus described above, multiple other viruses with pandemic potential, including h5n1, h9n2, and h10n8 subtypes, that have caused human infections in the past, continue to circulate in birds and other animals. therefore, vaccines capable of protecting against multiple potentially pandemic influenza strains would be advantageous for pandemic preparedness and public health.one way to achieve protection against multiple strains and increase the breadth of immune response afforded by vlps can be a blended formulation of monovalent vaccines. a vaccine was prepared by mixing vlps that display h1, h3, h5 or h7 ha molecules. mice vaccinated with these vlps intranasally showed significant protection (94% aggregate survival following vaccination) against 1918 h1, 1957 h2, and avian h5, h6, h7, h10 and h11 ha subtypes [41] . these experiments suggest a promising and practical strategy for developing a broadly protective influenza vaccine.potentially, ha molecules from different subtypes can be co-localized within recombinant vlp envelope for broader immune coverage. a multi-subtype, mosaic vlp design containing three or four subtypes of the full-length rha within the envelope has also been described [50, 71] . a triple-subtype vlp contained ha proteins from the potentially pandemic h5n1, h7n2, and h9n2 subtypes [50] . a recombinant baculovirus vector was prepared to co-express the h5, h7, and h9 genes from a/viet nam prepared in sf9 cells, and the immunogenicity and efficacy of the resulting h5/h7/h9 vlps were evaluated in a ferret animal model following intranasal (i.n.) vaccination. we showed that i.n. vaccination with the h5/h7/h9 triple-subtype vlp induced immune responses and protected ferrets from experimental challenges with three subtypes of avian influenza viruses [50] . we also prepared triple-ha mosaic vlps that co-localized a/vietnam/1203/2004 (h5n1), a/hong kong/33982/2009 (h9n2) and a/shanghai/2/2013 (h7n9) rha proteins, as well as quadri-ha vlps (figure 3 ). envelope for broader immune coverage. a multi-subtype, mosaic vlp design containing three or four subtypes of the full-length rha within the envelope has also been described [50, 71] . a triplesubtype vlp contained ha proteins from the potentially pandemic h5n1, h7n2, and h9n2 subtypes [50] . a recombinant baculovirus vector was prepared to co-express the h5, h7, and h9 genes from a/viet nam/1203/2004 (h5n1), a/new york/107/2003 (h7n2) and a/hong kong/33982/2009 (h9n2) viruses, respectively, as well as na and m1 genes from a/puerto rico/8/1934 (h1n1) virus. vlps were prepared in sf9 cells, and the immunogenicity and efficacy of the resulting h5/h7/h9 vlps were evaluated in a ferret animal model following intranasal (i.n.) vaccination. we showed that i.n. vaccination with the h5/h7/h9 triple-subtype vlp induced immune responses and protected ferrets from experimental challenges with three subtypes of avian influenza viruses [50] . we also prepared triple-ha mosaic vlps that co-localized a/vietnam/1203/2004 (h5n1), a/hong kong/33982/2009 (h9n2) and a/shanghai/2/2013 (h7n9) rha proteins, as well as quadri-ha vlps (figure 3) . by using group antigen (gag) derived from bovine retrovirus as a vlp core in place of m1 protein, quadri-subtype vlps were prepared, which co-expressed within the vlp the four ha subtypes derived from avian-origin h5n1, h7n9, h9n2 and h10n8 viruses. vlps showed hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities and reacted with specific antisera [84] . quadrisubtype vaccine elicited serum antibody in ferrets to the homologous h5, h7, h9, and h10 antigens. antiserum was also evaluated for cross-reaction with multiple clades of h5n1 virus, and crossreactivity has been confirmed. the level of immune response suggests protection against multiple influenza subtypes, which was experimentally confirmed by challenge with h10 iav. ferrets were protected from challenge with h10 virus [85] . overall, such multi-subtype, mosaic vlps that colocalize distinct ha subtypes in the envelope showed broader protection range against different influenza viruses [47, 85, 86] . multi-subtype mosaic vlps combine advantages of conserved ha (c) quadri-subtype vlps co-localizing h5, h7, h9 and h10 subtypes along with n1 and gag within a vlp. by using group antigen (gag) derived from bovine retrovirus as a vlp core in place of m1 protein, quadri-subtype vlps were prepared, which co-expressed within the vlp the four ha subtypes derived from avian-origin h5n1, h7n9, h9n2 and h10n8 viruses. vlps showed hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities and reacted with specific antisera [84] . quadri-subtype vaccine elicited serum antibody in ferrets to the homologous h5, h7, h9, and h10 antigens. antiserum was also evaluated for cross-reaction with multiple clades of h5n1 virus, and cross-reactivity has been confirmed. the level of immune response suggests protection against multiple influenza subtypes, which was experimentally confirmed by challenge with h10 iav. ferrets were protected from challenge with h10 virus [85] . overall, such multi-subtype, mosaic vlps that co-localize distinct ha subtypes in the envelope showed broader protection range against different influenza viruses [47, 85, 86] . multi-subtype mosaic vlps combine advantages of conserved ha epitope and blended vlps, as vlps contain both subtype-specific head epitopes and the conserved stem epitopes.recently, a vlp preparation consisting of retroviral gag-vlps pseudo-typed with the ha was expressed using the novel trichoplusia ni (t.ni)-derived insect cell line tnms42 and tested successfully to assess the sole contribution of anti-ha immunity in limiting post-influenza secondary staphylococcus aureus bacterial infection, morbidity and mortality in a situation of a vaccine match and mismatch [87] . the results demonstrate that matched anti-ha immunity elicited by a vlp preparation may suffice to prevent morbidity and mortality caused by lethal secondary bacterial infection.it should also be noted that cross-reactive antibodies to the h7n9 virus were also induced by recombinant viral vectors, such as newcastle disease virus (ndv) [88] [89] [90] and parainfluenza virus piv5 [91] .the emerging strains potentially can be also targeted by "universal" vaccines consisting of conserved viral proteins or epitopes, such as stem region of ha, or extracellular domain m2e of the ion channel protein m2, which are both considered capable of inducing cross-reactive immune responses. targeting the stem region of ha for antibody production could be a promising approach to generate a viruses 2020, 12, 518 10 of 18 broadly protective influenza vaccine. the immune response can be elicited against both the head and stem region of ha protein. however, because of the constantly changing nature of the head region due to the antigenic drift, new vaccine candidates need to be updated frequently. since the stem region is evolutionally more stable and more conserved among different influenza strains, vaccine candidates targeting the stem region might not need to be updated every year and could induce a broad range of protective immunity against different influenza strains [92, 93] . however, the stem region is less immunogenic in the virus. therefore, chimeric vlp approaches have been used to elicit antibodies to the stem region of ha. the long alpha-helix (lah) region located in influenza virus hemagglutinin (ha) shows conservation among different influenza a strains, and could be used as a candidate target for influenza vaccines. the hepatitis b virus core protein (hbc) was used as a carrier for heterologous lah epitopes to elicit effective immune responses [94] . the spatial conformation of lah epitope cloned in the major immunodominant region (mir) of the hbc molecule and expressed in yeast is shown on figure 4 . the lah region of the h7n9 influenza virus was inserted into the hbc to prepare chimeric lah-hbc protein, which was capable of self-assembly into vlps in e. coli expression system [95] . intranasal immunization of the lah-hbc vlp in combination with chitosan adjuvant or ctb * adjuvant in mice induced both humoral and cellular immune responses effectively and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge with homologous h7n9 virus or heterologous h3n2 virus, as well as partial protection against lethal challenge of heterologous h1n1 virus. these results provide a proof of concept for lah-hbc vlp vaccine that can be rapidly produced and potentially can serve as an antigen against a future influenza pandemic [95] . in another study, the globular head domain (ha1-2, aa 62-284) of the protective h7 ha was fused to the potent tlr5 ligand, salmonella typhimurium flagellin (flic) [96] . the resulting fusion protein, ha1-2-flic, which apparently did not form vlps, was efficiently expressed in e. coli, retained the native ha and flic conformations, and was highly immunogenic in mice by intraperitoneal vaccination. furthermore, highly immunogenic influenza vlps have been prepared via the overexpression of four viral proteins, ha, na, m1, and m2, using m2 fusion with the flic [97] . the chimeric h5n1 vlps were further combined with the molecular adjuvant, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), flic, or a gm-csf/flic [98] . all three forms of the chimeric h5n1 vlps elicited protective immunity against live virus. next, the gm-csf/flic h5n1 vlps were obtained to include h7 or h1h7 antigens for developing multi-subtype influenza vaccines [98] . in another study, the globular head domain (ha1-2, aa 62-284) of the protective h7 ha was fused to the potent tlr5 ligand, salmonella typhimurium flagellin (flic) [96] . the resulting fusion protein, ha1-2-flic, which apparently did not form vlps, was efficiently expressed in e. coli, retained the native ha and flic conformations, and was highly immunogenic in mice by intraperitoneal vaccination. furthermore, highly immunogenic influenza vlps have been prepared via the overexpression of four viral proteins, ha, na, m1, and m2, using m2 fusion with the flic [97] . the chimeric h5n1 vlps were further combined with the molecular adjuvant, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), flic, or a gm-csf/flic [98] . all three forms of the chimeric h5n1 vlps elicited protective immunity against live virus. next, the gm-csf/flic h5n1 vlps were obtained to include h7 or h1h7 antigens for developing multi-subtype influenza vaccines [98] .the chimeric norovirus vlps, p particles, were used to express the trivalent ha2:90-105 epitopes derived from h1, h3 and b subtypes, with 24 copies in total, on the surface loops [99] .finally, trimeric h7 transiently expressed in n. benthamiana was conjugated successfully onto the surface of nanodiamond particles [100] . after two or three immunizations in mice, the mixture of trimeric h7 protein and nanodiamond elicited statistically significant stronger h7-specific-igg response demonstrated by higher amounts of h7n9-specific igg.other universal influenza vaccine approaches applicable to h7n9 were based on ion channel protein m2. extracellular part of m2 protein,~23 aa residues, is highly conserved among human iav strains, suggesting its potential utility as a broadly protective immunogen for the development of broadly protective influenza vaccines. tandem repeats of heterologous m2e sequences (m2e5x) derived from human, swine, and avian origin influenza a viruses were expressed on influenza vlps in a membrane-anchored form. immunization of mice with m2e5x vlps induced antibodies that were cross-reactive to antigenically distinct influenza a viruses and conferred cross-protection [101] . furthermore, the m2e5x vlps demonstrated a clear advantage in inducing igg2a isotype antibodies, t cell responses, plasma cells and germinal center b cells as well as in conferring cross protection [102] . these studies paved the way to a novel vaccination strategy by enhancing the cross protective efficacy of live attenuated influenza virus vaccines by supplemented vaccination with m2e5x vlps [103] .high immunogenicity in mice, even in the absence of adjuvants, was demonstrated by the m2e displayed on vlps of macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus [104, 105] . this novel vaccine candidate was tested by the h1n1 and h3n2 challenge in mice, and potentially, it can be universal and applicable to h7n9 virus. in another example, the m2e proteins, as well as na, were expressed on recombinant lactococcus lactis, which conferred effective mucosal and systemic immune responses [106] .heterogenous composition is one of the challenges associated with the use of influenza vlps as a vaccine candidate. vlps produced by using baculovirus expression system contain live baculovirus vector as impurity. moreover, considerable fraction of ha protein is bound to viral envelope of baculovirus [107] . therefore, it is difficult to distinguish whether the ha activity is associated with influenza vlp or with baculovirus-displayed ha in the unpurified samples during vaccine manufacturing, which also causes difficulty for ha quantification. vlps produced from mammalian expression system do not contain baculovirus contamination but they contain extracellular particles and produce low yields, with vlps needing to be concentrated up to 200 times to reach measurable titers [72] . the current methods that are used for quantification are mostly applicable to concentrated and purified vlps; however, better methods need to be developed to characterize the materials at the different stage of bioprocessing during the manufacturing process. other potential challenges include the presence of endogenous rhabdovirus in standard sf9 cell lines [108] . although insect rhabdovirus is not associated with any human disease, the development of rhabdovirus-free cell line can resolve this potential safety concern [108, 109] .to overcome manufacturing challenges, technological improvements to production of h7n9 vlps in baculovirus-sf9 insect cell cultures have been reported [110] [111] [112] . the yield and quality of influenza vlps produced in insect cells could be improved by inhibiting cytopathic effects of the protein m2 [62] . the ion channel activity of m2 induces significant cytopathic effects in sf9 insect cells. these effects include altered sf9 cell morphology and reduced baculovirus replication, resulting in impaired influenza protein expression and thus vlp production. the use of the m2 inhibitor amantadine indeed improved sf9 cellular expression not only of m2 (∼three-fold), but also of ha (∼seven-fold) and of matrix protein m1 (∼three-fold) when co-expressed to produce influenza vlps. this increased cellular expression of all three influenza proteins further led to ∼two-fold greater vlp yield. the quality of the resulting influenza vlps was significantly improved, as demonstrated by the ∼two-fold, ∼50-fold, and ∼two-fold increase in the antigen density to approximately 53 ha, 48 m1, and 156 m2 per influenza vlp, respectively [62] .for purification of influenza vlps, a nitrocellulose membrane-based filtration system [113] and a cascade of ultrafiltration and diafiltration steps, followed by a sterile filtration step [109, 114] were used successfully. the bioprocessing of influenza vlps was recently reviewed [115] . recently, a fast chromatography step purification method was developed for chimeric hiv-1 gag influenza-ha vlps produced in tnms42 insect cells using the baculovirus insect cell expression vector system [116] . the absence of the baculovirus capsid protein p39 in the product fraction was confirmed by hplc-ms. the process is simple and includes only a few handling steps, which has promising characteristics to become a platform for purification of these types of vlps [116] .regarding the detection and quality assessment of influenza vaccines, several methodologies are being used. these include development of standards for potency determination [117] . a high-resolution lc-ms method allows the quantitation of both ha and na protein concentrations in influenza vlp vaccine candidates [118] .recombinant vlps were developed with the purpose of rapidly preparing influenza vaccines including against pandemic threat viruses such as h7n9 virus. multiple designs of vlps have been evaluated including the use of multivalent vlps, multi-subtype mosaic vlp, and rationally designed vlps containing conserved influenza virus epitopes. the use of highly conserved epitopes remains a promising approach for the improved design of highly immunogenic vlps. blended vlps have been used as a classic approach to broaden immune coverage. multi-subtype mosaic vlps potentially combine the conserved epitope and blended approaches, as vlps contain both subtype-specific head epitopes and the conserved stem epitopes. in addition to vlps, other novel technologies have been used to develop improved influenza vaccines including dna vaccines, viral vectors, advanced adjuvants, and other approaches. potentially, the combination of various technologies can prove beneficial for the development of next-generation influenza vaccines including h7n9.influenza is an infectious viral disease of the respiratory system, caused by influenza viruses belonging to orthomyxoviridae. there are three types of the influenza virus: a, b and c, among which infections caused by type c are asymptomatic. in every epidemic season, infections are induced by influenza virus type a and b, with usually a different course of illness for either type of virus, which also depends on the patient's age and the immune system's efficiency (brydak 2008) . influenza a virus is divided into subtypes, depending on the combination of the surface antigens hemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na). there are 18 types of ha and 11 types of na described (wu et al. 2014) . improperly treated infections caused by influenza viruses can lead to complications and consequently to death. therefore, it is important to confirm the presence of influenza virus in a short period of time, using molecular biology methods (bednarska et al. 2016b) , which enables to apply antiviral drugs, i.e., neuraminidase inhibitors, soon after onset of symptoms (fiore et al. 2011; brydak 2008) .the 2015/2016 influenza season was characterized by an increase in the number of cases and suspected cases of the influenza and influenza-like viruses, compared to the 2014/ 2015 season. there has also been a significant increase in deaths due to complications of influenza, the number of which was up to 135 in adult patients, compared with the mere 11 fatal cases in the 2014/2015 season.it is meaningful that in adult patients qualified to high-risk groups, e.g., those over 65 years of age, influenza may lead to exacerbations of chronic diseases and may be characterized by an acute fulminant course (mastalerz-migas et al. 2015; brydak et al. 2009 ). however, the percentage of vaccinated population was only 2.39% in this age range in poland in the epidemic season in question, despite the fact that the majority of local governments make the vaccination available free of charge for people over 50 years of age (brydak et al. 2012) .the aim of the present study was to analyze the activity influenza and influenza-like viruses in people over the age of 14 in the 2015/2016 influenza season in poland, according to the new reporting system (bednarska et al. 2016a the isolated material was analyzed using the rt-pcr to confirm the presence of influenza a and b viruses. a transcriptor one-step rt-pcr kit (qiagen; venlo, the netherlands) was used for the rt-pcr reaction. a 20 μl reaction mix, consisting of rnase free water, buffer, primer f (5 mm), primer r (5 mm), and the transcriptor enzyme mix, was incubated with 5 μl rna isolated from a sample. for each tested sample, an internal control amplification was performed. (h3n2), and b/phuket/3073/2013 viruses, and rnase-free water was used for negative control. before the amplification step, isolated rna were reverse transcribed into cdna at 45 c for 15 min. the cdna was analyzed as follows: initialization step of 1 cycle at 95 c for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of amplification consisting of denaturation at 95 c for 15 s, annealing at 55 c for 30 s, and elongation at 72 c for 20 s.the presence of influenza-like viruses was confirmed in two steps by rt-pcr using rv12 ace detection kit (seegene; seul, south korea . 1) . there also were confirmed cases of influenza b in individuals over 14 years of age. this was actually the dominant type of influenza virus in persons aged 15-25. however, the highest number of cases of influenza virus type b was found in the persons aged 26-44 (n ¼ 201), far fewer in those aged 15-25 years (n ¼ 95), 45-64 years (n ¼ 85), and over 65 years (n ¼ 89) (fig. 2) .in the 2015/2016 influenza season, there were just 16 cases of influenza-like viruses reported, with rsv (n ¼ 6), piv-3 (n ¼ 4), and adv (n ¼ 3) reported most frequently and with individual cases of piv 1, hcov and rhv a/b virues.the number of 3,864,731 cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses in the 2015/2016 influenza epidemic season in poland was comparable to that present in the preceding season (niph-nih 2015/2016). however, the number of hospitalizations and deaths due to complications increased dramatically. the number of deaths increased from 11 in 2014/ 2015 to 140 in 2015/2016 (table 1) . despite a comparable number of cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses, the number of confirmed cases increased to 40.2% in 2015/2016 up from 21.2% in 2014/ 2015 (bednarska et al. 2016) . there also was a difference in the most frequent contagion between the two seasons, with subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 (62.6%) predominating in 2015/2016 as opposed to a/h3n2/ predominating the season before in persons over 14 years of age (hallmann-szelińska et al. 2016) . the present study demonstrates that subtype a/h1n1/pdm09 predominated in all age groups, except for 15-24 years old persons in whom virus type b was dominant (fig. 2) . in both compared seasons, the highest incidence of influenza was reported in the age-groups of 45-64 and 26-44 years and the lowest one in the 15-24 years old persons ( fig. 1) (bednarska et al. 2016b) . interestingly, the number of confirmed cases of influenza virus was the highest in the same age-groups of 45-64 and 26-44 years in the past 2013/2014 season (bednarska et al. 2015) . we also found that the activity of rsv and piv-3 was increased in 2015/2016 compared with that in the season before (niph-nih 2015/ 2016).the following strains were included into the influenza vaccine in the 2015/2016 season: a/california/7/2009(h1n1)pdm09, a/switzerland/9715293/2013(h3n2) and b/phuket/3073/ 2013. a particular attention should be paid to the a/california/7/2009(h1n1)pdm09 strain which was a vaccine component since the 2010/ 2011 season, and also caused most influenza cases in persons over 14 years of age in the currently evaluated season. given that the percentage of vaccinated population in this age range in poland ranks at a dismally low level and has a decreasing trend from 1.95% in 2011 to 1.37% in 2015 (epimeld 2016) , it can be judged that that the recorded number of influenza cases reflects the immunodeficiency to this viral strain (brydak 2015) .an increased number of confirmed cases of infection in the currently evaluated season was mainly caused by the influenza virus and to a lesser extent by influenza-like viruses, which may lead to a severer disease course, complications, and in consequence to death. the death as a sequelae of influenza was due usually to complications arising from the underlying chronic comorbidities, especially cardiovascular and respiratory disorders that ended up in fulminant pneumonia. the present findings of 40.2% of confirmed cases of influenza and influenza-like viruses in the 2015/2016 influenza season show a near doubling of laboratory confirmations compared with past seasons (bednarska et al. 2016b; bednarska et al. 2015) . that result points to substantial improvements in infection surveillance and imbued nuances in the virological and epidemiological procedures despite a drastically low and inexplicably decreasing percentage of adult, mostly middle-aged, population getting vaccinated against influenza each epidemic season in poland. the virological data presented in this article seek to call repeat attention to the need to vaccinate against influenza as the most effective method of preventing the infection and its severe complications, death included; a need advocated by the who, major medical societies, and 142 national influenza centers worldwide.which were concentrated approximately 100-to 200-fold. serial 2-fold dilutions of bcv were prepared in 0.05 ml of veronal buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.001% gelatin and mixed with 0.05 ml of 0.8 and 0.4% suspensions of mouse and pooled adult chicken erythrocytes, respectively, in the same buffer. the mixtures were then incubated for 1 h at either 4 or 37 °c and the ha titers were determined. the plates incubated at 4 °c were moved to 37 °c for 2 h to measure inactivation of receptors reflected by the disaggregation of the bcv-erythrocyte complexes mediated by the receptor destroying enzyme (rde) activity [22] .antigenic comparisons of bcv strains were done by indirect if, virus neutralization (vn) and ha inhibition (hi) tests. the indirect if tests were performed as previously described [8] . virus titration and vn tests were conducted with hrt-18 cells in microplates as previously described [25] . virus infectivity titers were expressed as median tissue culture infective doses (tcids0)/ml. the vn antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited cytopathic effects (cpe). the antigenic relatedness (r) between the strains was calculated using the formula [1, 8] :in which rl is heterologous titer (strain 2)/homologous titer (strain 1), and r2 is heterologous titer (strain 1)/homologous titer (strain 2). the hi test was done using standard techniques with mouse erythrocytes [ 19] and sera treated with kaolin and mouse erythrocytes. the antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilutions producing complete hi.cytopathic effects were evident in hrt-18 cells inoculated with each of the strains of bcv. cytopathic effects were characterized by enlarged, rounded, and densely granular cells that occurred in clusters at 2 to 3 postinoculation days [2] , and no differences were observed in cpe among these strains. syncytia were also clearly observed in hrt-18 cells at 2 days after inoculation with these strains following staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-bcv serum. infectivity titers of bcv reached 10 7° to 10 8-7 tcidsjml at the 5th to 10th passages on hrt-18 cells.the ha and rde titers of purified bcv strains are summarized in table 1 . all strains agglutinated mouse erythrocytes and no differences were observed in ha titers against mouse erythrocytes at 4 ° and 37 °c. all strains also agglutinated chicken erythrocytes at 4 °c, but the ha titers varied among the bcv strains. this diversity was reflected in variations of the ratios of ha titer with mouse erythrocytes to ha titer with chicken erythrocytes (m/c ha titer ratio) at 4 °c. however there was no relation between m/c ha titer ratio and the clinical source (cd or wd) of the strains. at 37 °c, the mebus and db2 strains of cd bcv and the dba and sd strains of wd bcv agglutinated chicken erythrocytes with the same ha titers as at 4 °c. however, the other strains of bcv did not agglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 37 °c, and showed rde activity against chicken erythrocytes. receptor-destroying enzyme activity with mouse erythrocytes was not uexpressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of virus causing complete disappearance of ha patterns at 4 °c after 2 h incubation at 37 °c ° cd calf diarrhea, wd winter dysentery of adult cattle dm/c ratio of ha titer with mouse erythrocytes to ha titer with chicken erythrocytes detected for any strain of bcv. according to these results, bcv strains were classified into 3 groups. the first group (cd isolates, mebus, db2; and wd isolates, dba, sd) showed low m/c ha titer ratios(<_16), no differences in ha titers against chicken erythrocytes at 4 and 37 °c and no rde activity against chicken erythrocytes. the second group (cd isolate, 216xf; and wd isolates, cn, be, aw)showed low m/c ha titer ratios (<32), no ha against chicken erythrocytes at 37 °c and rde activity with chicken erythrocytes. the third group (cd isolates, ohc, sdc, jaz; and wd isolates, ts, bm, bw) showed high m/c ha titer ratios (>256), no ha against chicken erythrocytes at 37 °c and rde activity with chicken erythrocytes. these variations in ha and rde activities were unrelated to the clinical source of the isolates (cd or wd). in indirect if tests, all of the antisera reacted to each virus strain with high titer (102 400 to 409 600), and each antiserum showed no significant differences in reactivity with the homologous and heterologous strains (not greater than twofold differences).the results of vn tests are shown in table 2 . all of the antisera neutralized the heterologous strains, showing that the strains were closely related antigenically. however, antisera to the mebus cd, and sd and bm wd strains showed 16-fold or lower vn antibody titers against the dba, ts, be and bw wd strains and the 216xf, jaz, ohc and sdc cd strains than against the homologous strains. these differences were reflected in the r% values: the mebus, sd and bm strains generated r % values of 13 to 25 against the dba, ts, be and 216xf strains. the hi antibody titers are shown in table 3 . all of the strains showed crossreactivity, but differences in antibody titers were observed. the db2 strain of cd bcv and the sd strain ofwd bcv were closely related in the hi tests, and antisera to these strains distinguished most other strains with 16-fold or greater differences in the hi antibody titers.bovine coronavirus causes neonatal cd [13] and is also associated with wd of adult cattle [17] . based on epidemiological data, these disease syndromes often occur as separate and distinct outbreaks in herds [4, 12, 17] ; hence antigenic or biological differences between cd and wd bcv might be expected. calf diarrhea bcv isolates belong to a single serotype [4, 15, 25] , but minor antigenic and biological variations among them have been revealed in limited studies [6, 8, 11, 14, 23] . in this study, we compared the antigenic and biological diversity of a variety of wd and cd bcv isolates.storz et al. [23] reported that variations in the ratios of ha titers with mouse erythrocytes to those with chicken erythrocytes (m/c ha titer ratio in this report) ~expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum inhibiting ha activity. homologous titers are in bold. titers which differed by 16-tbld or greater with homologous titers are underlined bcd calf diarrhea, wd winter dysentery of adult cattle were observed among cd bcv strains. the l9 strain of cd bcv at the high cell culture passage level (the 78th passage) showed a low mtc ha titer ratio (8) whereas the wild type cd bcv strains at low cell culture passage levels (the 3rd to 8th passages) showed high m/c ha titer ratios (128 to 256). in this study, the high cell culture-passaged mebus strain of cd bcv (the 77th passage) showed a low m/c ha titer ratio (2), but some low cell culture-passaged cd strains (db2, 216xf) and wd strains (cn, dba, sd, be, aw) of bcv (the 5th to 10th passages) also showed low m/c ratios (4 to 32). the differences in ha titers against chicken erythrocytes at 4 ° and 37 °c showed good agreement with the rde titers for chicken erythrocytes. this suggests that comparison of ha titers obtained at 4 ° and 37 °c may provide an alternative method for evaluting rde activity. on the basis of ha and rde patterns, bcv strains were classified into 3 groups. however, each group contained both cd and wd bcv and no relationship between each group and the clinical (cd or wd) or geographic origin of the strains was observed.all strains of both cd and wd bcv examined in this study were related antigenically. specially, each antiserum showed no significant difference between the homologous and heterologous strains in indirect if antibody titers. however, some antigenic diversity among bcv strains was observed by vn and hi tests. in our previous report [2] , hyperimmune antiserum prepared in a gnotobiotic calf to the mebus strain of cd bcv had an 8-to 32-fold lower vn antibody titer against the dba strain ofwd bcv than against the homologous strain. in this study, guinea pig hyperimmune antiserum to the mebus strain showed similar vn antibody titer differences between homologous and the dba strains. in addition, this serum also distinguished three other strains ofwd bcv and four strains ofcd bcv from the homologous virus by 16-to 64-fold differences. moreover, hyperimmune antisera to the sd and bm strains ofwd bcv also distinguished the same strains which were distinguished by the anti-mebus serum, form homologous strains by 16-to 64-fold differences in antibody titers in vn tests. although these variations were recognized only in one-way reactions and all strains examined could be classified into a single serotype, the strains showing these variations might be further divided into 2 subtypes. the mebus, sd and bm strains which belong to the same potential subtype could be distinguished from the dba, ts, be and 216xf strains, which constitute another possible subtype (r% values of 13 to 25). the bw, jaz, ohc and sdc strains also appeared to belong to the latter subtype. the db2, cn and aw strains comprised an intermediate group that cross-reacted with both subtypes. interestingly, antiserum to the mebus strain of bcv which had been prepared in guinea pig in japan showed only a 2-fold lower vn antibody titer against the 216xf strain than against the homologous strain [25] . in the present study, antiserum to the mebus strain prepared in the u.s.a. had 16-fold vn antibody titer differences against the homologous and 216xf strains. the reason for this discrepancy is unknown, but differences in the passage level of the mebus strain at the preparation of antiserum might affect the virus antigenicity [10] . alternatively, contamination of cultures with other bcv might occur after import and propagation in japan.bovine coronavirus strains examined in this study showed minor antigenic and biological variations, but this diversity was unrelated to the geographic origin or affected animal age groups (wd and cd) from which these strains were recovered. based on preliminary data, gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived calves inoculated orally and nasally with wd bcv shed bcv rectally and nasally and developed diarrhea, which was indistinguishable from disease symptoms in calves inoculated with cd bcv [9] . also, a cow inoculated via a duodenal cannula with cd bcv developed diarrhea and shed bcv (h. tsunemitsu et at. 1994' unpublished data). these results suggest that the differences in these disease syndromes (wd and cd) are not related to viral factors, but to host and environmental factors; e.g. the immunological status of animals, environmental temperatures, secondary or coinfections with other pathogens, etc. [3, 12, 17] . further studies are in progress to compare the antigenicity of bcv strains using monoclonal antibodies and in vivo cross-protection tests.species of cryptosporidium are important zoonotic parasites that infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans [1] . there are extensive genetic variations within the cryptosporidium genus. in addition to 27 recognized species of cryptosporidium, more than 70 cryptosporidium genotypes with no designated species names have been described [2] [3] [4] [5] . cryptosporidium can be transmitted by the faecal-oral route, via either direct contact or ingestion of contaminated food or water [1] .cryptosporidiosis, caused by cryptosporidium infection, is of great concern because of associated economic losses and the public health significance in humans. diarrhoea is a typical clinical sign of human and animal cryptosporidiosis; dehydration, fever, nausea and anorexia are sometimes symptoms in infected hosts. over 200 water-borne, food-borne, person-to-person, and zoonotic cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been recorded [6] . the most famous cryptosporidiosis outbreak occurred in milwaukee (wisconsin, usa), where 403,000 people were infected through contaminated drinking water [7] . in recent years, cryptosporidiosis outbreaks have been reported in several european and american countries [8] [9] [10] [11] . molecular techniques have shown that c. parvum is the predominant species in cryptosporidiosis outbreaks, accounting for 50.8% of cases among 325 water-borne outbreaks of parasitic protozoan diseases worldwide [6] .cattle are the most common mammalian species in which cryptosporidium is detected; pre-weaned calves are considered reservoirs for zoonotic c. parvum [12] . of 14 c. parvum subtype families (iia, iib, iic, iid, iie,  iif, iig, iih, iii, iik, iil, iim, iin, and iio) , iia and iid are the two major zoonotic subtype families in animals and humans, while iic and iie are anthroponotic subtype families [13] . other subtype families of c. parvum are occasionally seen in humans and other animals [2, 14] .in china, cryptosporidium infections have been reported in domestic animals, wild animals, and humans [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . a cryptosporidiosis outbreak was noticed in a paediatric hospital in shanghai [19] . in the current study we have briefly described a cryptosporidiosis outbreak that occurred at a dairy farm in the ningxia autonomous region (northwestern china). the infection rate and species distribution of cryptosporidium were also determined.the investigated farm, located in the ningxia autonomous region of northwestern china, was established in july 2012 with 7000 dairy cattle (2600 calves and 4400 adult cattle). the breeding cattle were introduced from australia and uruguay, while forage was produced in the united states. previously, vaccination was not done against rotaviruses, coronaviruses, and e. coli. before this outbreak, cryptosporidium oocysts were not detected using conventional faecal examination by microscopy. in october 2013, severe diarrhoea was observed in 396 preweaned calves on this farm. 356 of the calves, in particular the 2-3-week-olds, died despite being treated with antibiotics. we collected 30 faecal samples from calves with diarrhoea and subjected them to testing for gastrointestinal pathogens [rota, corona, e. coli f5 (k99), crypto] using the commercial digestive kit (real bio-technology, qingdao, china). one month later, the symptom of diarrhoea gradually disappeared in calves.during specimen collection, all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the chinese laboratory animal administration act 1988.prior to experiment, the protocol of the current study wasreviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of henan agricultural university (license no. 2014-018).to determine infection rate and species distribution of cryptosporidium, we obtained 252 faecal samples: 158 were from pre-weaned calves, 55 from post-weaned calves, and 39 from heifers and adults. fresh faecal samples for each animal were collected immediately after defecation on the ground. cryptosporidium oocysts in faecal samples were concentrated using sheather's sugar flotation technique, with samples from pre-weaned calves subjected to formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation [14] .cryptosporidium-positive samples were determined by microscopy and stored in 2.5% potassium dichromate at 4°c prior to dna extraction.genomic dna was extracted from cryptosporidiumpositive faecal samples using the e.z.n.a. stool dna kit (omega biotek inc., norcross, ga, usa) according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures. cryptosporidium species were determined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis, and by dna sequence analysis of the small subunit (ssu) rrna gene [20] . subtyping of c. parvum was conducted using a nested pcr technique targeting the gp60 gene, which encodes the 60 kda glycoprotein [2, 21] . amplicons were sequenced on an abi prismtm 3730 xl dna analyzer using the big dye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (applied biosystems, foster city, ca, usa). sequence accuracy was confirmed by twodirectional sequencing and by sequencing a fresh pcr amplicon if necessary. sequence alignment was carried out using clustalx 1.83 (ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ clustalx/). representative nucleotide sequences were deposited in genbank (accession numbers km215133-km215134, and km873712-km873713).using the digestive kit, we found that nine samples were positive for cryptosporidium and four were positive for rotavirus. none of the samples analyzed with the digestive kit were positive for coronavirus or e. coli f5 (k99).microscopy examination revealed the overall prevalence of cryptosporidium to be 21% (53/252). the infection rate was 31 (49/158), 7.3 (4/55), and 0% (0/39) for pre-weaned, 3-11-month-old, and >1-year-old animals, respectively. the highest infection rate of 83.3% (40/48) was seen in 2-3-week-old calves that had severe diarrhoea. three cryptosporidium species were identified based on rflp and sequence analysis of the ssu rrna gene; there were 51 c. parvum isolates in pre-weaned (n = 48) and 3-11-month-old (n = 3) calves, one c. bovis isolate in a 3-11-month-old calf, and one c. ryanae isolate in a preweaned calf. all c. parvum isolates were successfully amplified at the gp60 locus, with sequencing analysis suggesting they were the iida15g1 subtype.diarrhoea is common in calves worldwide, and is considered a major cause of productivity decline and economic losses in the cattle industry [22] . previous studies have indicated that rotaviruses, coronaviruses, e. coli, and c. parvum are all contributing factors to diarrhoea in calves. however, c. parvum is believed to be the primary cause of calf diarrhoea, and is a potential zoonotic agent [23, 24] . results from the digestive kit in combination with high cryptosporidium prevalence (83.3%) in 2-3-week-old calves with diarrhoea were strong indicators that c. parvum was likely most responsible for diarrhoea and death.an overall infection rate of 21% on this farm was higher than that observed in heilongjiang (15.0%), henan (13.0%), and shannxi (3.4%) provinces in china [14, [25] [26] [27] [28] . the highest level of prevalence (83.3%) in 2-3-week-old calves was similar to that seen in previous studies [29] , and was consistent with the morbidity and mortality of calves in this age group.the predominance of c. parvum infection in preweaned calves seen in this study was highly similar to those seen in most studies conducted in other countries [2, 14, 27, 28] . it is known that c. parvum is a major etiological agent for sporadic cases, or water-and food-borne disease outbreaks in humans worldwide [9, [30] [31] [32] [33] . as a major reservoir of c. parvum, pre-weaned calves might play an important role in zoonotic infections [12] .previously, the c. parvum subtype iida15g1 has been detected in cattle, sheep and goats in iran, malaysia, and spain [34] [35] [36] [37] . it has also been found in humans from the netherlands, australia, iran, malaysia, and india [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . the iida15g1 subtype identified in this study was unlikely to have arrived via uruguay or the united states because the c. parvum iid subtype family has never been found in the americas [13] . it is also unlikely that iida15g1 was introduced from australia because c. parvum has not been detected in australian breeding cattle. thus, the source of the cryptosporidiosis outbreak could be attributed to c. parvum contamination in the area surrounding the farm. the iida15g1 subtype has been found in rodents in china, with c. parvum isolates from animals all belonging to the iid subtype [14, 18, 27, 28] . generally, iid is a major zoonotic subtype family reported in europe (hungary, germany, portugal, sweden, ireland, spain, belgium, romania, the united kingdom, the netherlands, slovenia, and serbia and montenegro), asia (kuwait, iran, jordan, india, malaysia, and china), africa (egypt and ethiopia), and australia [13, 14, 42, 43] .in comparison with cryptosporidiosis outbreaks in humans, only a few outbreaks have been reported in animals, including goats in brazil and oman [44, 45] , foals in new zealand [46] , cockatiels in japan [47] , stone curlews in the united arab emirates [48] , alpaca crias in the united states [49] , chelonians in australia [50] , and rabbits in poland [51] . the findings from our current study provide further information regarding cryptosporidiosis outbreaks among animal populations.in conclusion, this is the first report of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in chinese dairy cattle. the c. parvum iida15g1 subtype was responsible for the reported outbreak as determined by genotyping and subtyping tools. further studies are required to improve our understanding of the transmission and public health significance of cryptosporidium species in china.this is the first report of a cryptosporidiosis outbreak in chinese dairy cattle. the c. parvum iida15g1 subtype was responsible for the reported outbreak as determined by genotyping and subtyping tools.the authors declare that they have no competing interests.authors' contributions rjw, lxz conceived and designed the experiments; zhc, jyh, and jql performed the experiments; hyw, jfz, zjz, and nnl analyzed the data; zhc, rjw, and lxz wrote the manuscript. all the authors have read and approved the final version of the manuscript.the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has once again aroused people's concern about coronavirus. seven human coronaviruses (hcovs) have been discovered so far, including hcov-229e, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, hcov-hku115, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. existing studies show that the cardiovascular disease increased the incidence and severity of coronavirus infection. at the same time, myocardial injury caused by coronavirus infection is one of the main factors contributing to poor prognosis. in this review, the recent clinical findings about the relationship between coronaviruses and cardiovascular diseases and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. this review aimed to provide assistance for the prevention and treatment of covid-19.advances in the relationship between coronavirus infection and cardiovascular diseases.hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 [35] were discovered in the 1960s, and hcov-nl63 [22] and hcov-hku1 [26] were later discovered in upper respiratory tract infections, asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. there is evidence showing that infant, elderly and immunocompromised patients are more likely to be infected with high mortality rates [37, [62] [63] [64] . these infected patients are more likely develop severe disease states [65] [66] [67] [68] .varghese et al. [37] retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 261 children with hcov infection (including 229e, hku1, nl63, oc43) andfound that approximately 16.5% of the children had cardiovascular disease. hcov-infected children with cardiovascular disease are more likely to receive respiratory support and enter a pediatric intensive care unit (picu), suggesting that the underlying cardiovascular disease increased the severity of hcov infection in the children. cabeça et al. found that children with heart disease are more likely to be infected by hcovs [69] . the presence of congenital heart disease was a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus infection in children who were less than five years old [70] ( table 1) .hypotension was found in a small number of patients with these four hcov infections [70] (table 2 ). there is no relevant evidence showing that hcov infection can cause heart injury. however, kim et al. reported that hcovs were detected in children with kawasaki disease, which is characterized by acute systemic vasculitis in childhood and may induce severe cardiovascular complications [71] . serological tests suggest that hcov-229e may be involved in the occurrence of kawasaki disease [72] . therefore, we still need to pay attention to cardiovascular complications when facing these four kinds of hcov infection.the severe acute respiratory syndrome [27] that broke out globally in 2003 is different from the human coronavirus described previously. it is a severe acute respiratory infection with clinical manifestations of fever and dry cough, with the lungs as the main locations of lesions. some patients quickly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and multiple organ failure with high mortality [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] .there is much relevant evidence showing that pre-existing comorbid conditions are one of the major determinants of fatality [76, [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . it has been reported that the presence of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and heart disease, is associated with adverse outcomes and mortality in sars patients [84] [85] [86] [87] . wong et al. reviewed the medical records of fatal cases and found that 60% of the patients who died had comorbid conditions such as hypertension and coronary artery disease [88] . chen et al. found that patients with combined hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases are more likely to develop ards [89] . another study by hu et al. showed that the incidence rates of critical conditions and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mods ) among sars patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were 1.8-fold and 1.9-fold higher than those of patients without underlying disease, suggesting that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors for sars patients to devolve into critical conditions and mods and eventually lead to death [90] (table 1) .regarding the cardiovascular complications of sars patients, it was found that sars patients had subclinical diastolic impairment without contraction involvement, and this damage may be reversible upon clinical recovery [91] . another study by yu et al. found that cardiovascular complications, including hypotension and tachycardia, are common in sars patients but are usually self-limiting. bradycardia and cardiac hypertrophy were less common, and arrhythmias were rare [92] . acute myocardial infarction can also be seen in a few sars patients [93] . sars-cov was reported to be found in 40% (7/18 patients) of heart samples from patients who died of sars during the toronto outbreak [76] , which might explain the myocardial damage discovered in sars patients [89] . there are reports indicating that sars-cov also attacks small blood j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f cardiovascular disease increased the mortality of mers [108] . banik suggested that sufficient attention should be paid to mers patients with combined underlying diseases to reduce the occurrence of serious complications and mortality [109] (table 1) .heart damage was also reported in mers patients [110] . mers-cov was found in the kidneys of deceased patients but was not detected in the heart tissue, and the heart showed no significant histological changes [111, 112] . however, an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue, implying direct cardiac pathology [113] . the mechanism of heart injury in mers infection remains unclear and requires more research.covid-19, which broke out at the end of 2019, is a disease caused by infection with sars-cov-2 [1, 2, 4] . similar to sars-cov and mers-cov, sars-cov-2 is a β-cov [2] . covid-19 is similar to sars and mers and manifests as extensively pathological viral lung inflammation [1] .although similar to sars-cov and mers-cov, sars-cov-2 has its own characteristics [1, 114] . early cases suggest that covid-19 may not be as severe as sars and mers. however, the rapidly increasing number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission suggest that sars-cov-2 is more contagious than sars-cov and mers-cov and has a lower fatality [3, 9, [115] [116] [117] . up to april 27, 2020, the overall mortality of covid-19 was 6.9% globally [5] . but the fatality rate is different in different regions and times, ranging from 0.7% to 13.5% [5, 118] .the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 6.4 days [119] . fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the main manifestations of covid-19, and a few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea [2, 9, 120, 121] . patients with severe cases often experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after onset [122] . severe cases of covid-19 progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis, which is difficult to correct, and coagulopathy [10] .current case reports show that sars-cov-2 infection may have cardiovascular symptoms in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms. a small number of patients have atypical clinical manifestations and may start with cardiovascular symptoms such as chest tightness, palpitations and chest pain. a study by liu et al. found that 7.3% (10/137) of patients had palpitations as the first symptom [123] . it was also reported that 2% of patients experienced chest pain during hospitalization [11] . in addition, wang et al. found that 16.7% of patients with covid-19 had arrhythmias [10] .according to relevant studies [9] [10] [11] 124] , the proportion of covid-19 patients with comorbid cvds, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, was larger than that of patients with other comorbidities or without comorbidities, suggesting that patients with cvd may be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection. moreover, the incidence of cvd in patients with severe or fatal cases with covid-19 was higher than that in patients with nonsevere cases or in those who survived [12, 13, 124] . according to the reports of the chinese center for disease control and prevention, 15.7% of the deaths were hypertension, and 9% had other cardiovascular diseases, further suggesting that underlying cardiovascular diseases may be one of the important risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 [8] . it can be seen not only that the number of covid-19 patients with cardiovascular disease is large but also that these patients have poor tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop severe cases (table 1) .cardiac complications such as electrocardiography abnormities, diastolic dysfunction, and acute myocardial injury were reported in patients with covid-19 [124] [125] [126] [127] . cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after covid-19 [128] [129] [130] . and sars-cov-2 infection-related myocarditis is likely associated with myocardial injury [60, 128] . according to the study by li et al., the most common organ damage outside the lungs was heart injury[13]. serum myocardial necrosis markers such as hypersensitive troponin i (hs-tni) and creatine kinase (ck) increased to varying degrees in patients with mild and severe cases of covid-19 [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [131] [132] [133] [134] . however, the risk of heart injury was higher in patients with severe cases, approximately 22.2% to 31% [9, 12, 126, 133, 134] , than in patients with mild cases, approximately 2% to 4% [9, 10] . the percentage of heart injury in covid-19 patients who died, approximately 28% to 89% [12, 13, 132] , was higher than that in those who survived. n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) levels were also reported to be increased[13, 134, 135] . increased hs-tni and probnp expression levels may be risk factors for severe illness and high mortality of covid-19 [133] [134] [135] . furthermore, it was found that high hs-tni levels were associated with increased levels of inflammation (neutrophils, il-6, crp, and pct) and decreased levels of immunity (lymphocytes, monocytes, and cd4+ and cd8+ t cells), suggesting that cardiac injury may have something to do with the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response [131, 132] (table 2) .two recent studies published in jama cardiology reported the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 in detail [60, 136] . shi et al. found that cardiac injury was a common condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan, china, and it is associated with higher risk of inhospital mortality [136] . guo et al. reported that myocardial injury was significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19. myocardial injury was associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury [60] (table 2 ).j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f covid-19 may induce new cardiovascular diseases and / or aggravate potential cardiovascular diseases. the short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects of covid-19 and the effects of specific treatments are unclear and need further investigation.as the epidemic spread, sars-cov-2 evolved multiple subtypes. in a recent study, researchers proposed the subdivision of the global sars-cov-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (orf8) genes [137] . six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, accounting for more than 97% of the samples isolated from around the world. and the subtypes showed some geographical structure with two clusters: a smaller one comprised of isolates mostly sampled from western hemisphere (subtypes ii, vi, ix, x and xi) and a larger one whose isolates were sampled from western and eastern hemispheres (subtypes i, iii, iv, v, vii, viii, xii, xiii, xiv, xv and xvi) [137] . the researchers believed that the genetic structure determined for the sars-cov-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs [137] .in another earlier study, population genetic analyses of 103 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated l and s), that are well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) [138] . the l type (~70%) is more prevalent than the s type (~30%), but the s type was found to be the ancestral version. the l type is more aggressive and spread more quickly. and it was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan. but the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 for more severe j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f selective pressure placed by human intervention on the l type [138] . contrary to the l type, the s-type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to the weaker selective pressure [138] .it was also reported that among the 27 viruses isolated from wuhan, 26 (96.3%) were l type, and only 1 (3.7%) was s type [138] . however, among the other 73 viruses isolated outside wuhan, 45 (61.6%) were l type, and 28 (38.4%) were s type [138] . this comparison suggests that the l type was significantly more prevalent in wuhan than in other places. and recent studies about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with covid-19 in wuhan [9] [10] [11] 139] or outside wuhan [134, 140, 141] have showed that the mortality of covid-19 patients and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury outside wuhan was lower than that in wuhan (table 3) . although there were many reasons for the different incidence of cardiac injury and outcome of covid-19 in and outside wuhan, such as the shortage of medical resources in wuhan, the role of different sars-cov-2 subtypes cannot be ignored. the relationship between sars-cov-2 subtypes and the mortality of covid-19 or the cvd complications need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.according to the references above, we can see that patients with underlying cvd may be more likely to become infected with coronavirus, and cvd may be one of the risk factors for poor prognosis and high mortality of cov infection. few studies, however, have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations. we believe that the possible mechanisms may be related to inflammation.cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease are all metabolic-related diseases. it has been reported that metabolic syndrome can downregulate the key mediator of the host's innate immune response to pathogenesis, affecting the function of the innate and humoral immune systems [142] . chronic low-grade inflammatory disease has been widely recognized as a feature of coronary heart disease, and its occurrence is closely related to inflammation [143] . the occurrence of hypertension is associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and the activation of the immune system [144] . il-6, il-1 and tumor necrosis factor α (tnf-α) levels are higher in patients with hypertension than in patients with normal blood pressure [145] . this may explain why patients with underlying cardiovascular disease found in the clinic are more susceptible to infection.kulcsar et al. showed that mers-cov infection can lead to prolonged respiratory tract inflammation, immune cell dysfunction, and changes in the expression profile of inflammatory mediators [146] . lymphopenia and increased inflammatory mediators were found in sars-cov-2 infection [147] . immune disorders caused by sars-cov infection have also been reported [148] . these may lead to the exacerbation of the original cardiovascular disease, which is related to the death of some patients found in the clinic due to heart failure [88, 103, 132] . according to information released by the shanghai municipal health and family planning commission, the first covid-19 death in shanghai was in an individual who was 88 years old with a severe history of hypertension and cardiac insufficiency. an analysis of the cause of death suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction. therefore, sars-cov-2 infection was just an inducement for exacerbations [124] .overall, the heart and lungs are inseparable in the normal physiological functions of the human body. on the one hand, comorbidities and complications of the heart increase the risk of pneumonia infection and exacerbation; on the other hand, pneumonia infection may aggravate existing cardiovascular diseases, such as increased blood pressure, increased heart failure, and the recurrence of myocardial infarction.fever is a common symptom in patients with coronavirus infection [9, 27, 149] . fever promotes the immune functions of humans and some animals and decreases the pathogenicity of some microbes. antibody production, t-cell activation, neutrophil function, and macrophage oxidative metabolism have been reported to increase in the presence of fever [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] . however, to avoid excessively elevated body temperature affecting normal physiological functions, the body will activate sympathetic nerves and regulate circulatory function, which will increase the heart rate and cardiac output [155] . an increase in heart rate over a long period of time will lead to increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased cardiac output, which may cause ischemia or heart failure [156] . many diseases with fever symptoms may be complicated by myocarditis, such as spotted fever rickettsioses infection [157] , severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [158] , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [159] , dengue [160] [161] [162] , complicated scrub typhus [163] , herpes simplex virus infection [164] , enteric fever [165] .a decrease in cardiac function may occur in febrile illnesses, but whether myocardial damage is due to fever or the underlying infection is not known [166] . weissinger et al. found that in pigs with a bacterial infection with elevated body temperature, serum ck, lactate dehydrogenase (ld), j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f and gamma-globulin (gg) levels were increased. the administration of antibiotics to these pigs and lowering their body temperature reduced ck and ld levels, but gg levels remained elevated, suggesting that the infection did not decrease. this study indicated that the levels of ck and ld were elevated due to fever caused by infection [167] . k l et al. discovered that a longer duration of fever was related to the occurrence of pericarditis after myocardial infarction [168] . therefore, heart injury in coronavirus infection may be related to fever .severe pneumonia can cause significant gas exchange disturbances and lead to hypoxemia. hypoxia reduces the energy production required for cell metabolism and increases the body's anaerobic digestion. acidosis and oxygen free radicals accumulated in the cell destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane. as hypoxia continues, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases significantly, leading to a series of cell damage processes, including apoptosis [169] . at the same time, hypoxia can also induce inflammatory reactions, such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines, leading to further tissue ischemia, and may even cause myocardial infarction[13, 170, 171] .previous lessons from coronavirus and influenza have shown that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndrome [172, 173] , arrhythmia [174] , and exacerbation of heart failure [175] , mainly due to a combination of significant systemic inflammation response and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque, along with other effects [176] [177] [178] . evidence has shown that sars-cov induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (mcp-1), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta1), tnf, il-1 and il-j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 6 and interferon-β (ifn-β) in sars patients and experimental animal models infected with sars-cov [179, 180] . tnf and il-1 family and il-6 family cytokines are considered proinflammatory mediators of heart failure, and they have obvious negative inotropic effects, which may explain heart failure complications in sars infection [181] . the acute heart injury might be due to the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars infection [30] . there is evidence indicating that myocardial inflammation induced by sars-cov is mainly mediated by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines [95, 96] . the nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) signaling pathway associated with the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is activated in sars-cov-infected mice. treatment with drugs that inhibited nf-κb activation led to a reduction in inflammation in both sars-cov-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after sars-cov infection, indicating that the activation of the nf-κb signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after sars-cov infection and that nf-κb inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by sars-cov and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses [182] .sars-cov-2 appears to affect themyocardium and cause myocarditis [128] . myocardial injury is likely associated with infection-related myocarditis and/or ischemia [60] . increases in inflammatory factors such as crp, il-1 and il-6 were also discovered in sars-cov-2 infection [131, 132, 147] . wu et al. believed that sars-cov-2 may cause heart damage by the cytokine storm [131] . evidence has shown that sars-cov-2 may mainly affect t lymphocytes, especially cd4+ t cells, resulting in a significant decrease in lymphocyte numbers [183] . the extent of lymphopenia and an increase in inflammatory cytokines are related to the severity of the disease [147] . critically ill covid-19 patients had higher levels of il6, il10, tnfα, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and c-reactive protein than patients with mild covid-19 [9, 139, 184] , suggesting that inflammatory indicators are an important factor in the early diagnosis of severe covid-19.most patients with coronavirus infection are in an inflammatory state, which places the patients in a hypercoagulable state. for example, covid-19 leads to an increase in d-dimer levels in 40% of patients, a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) in 16% of patients, and a decrease in pt in 30% of patients, further increasing the risk of embolism [11] . hypercoagulability induced by inflammation might contribute to plaque rupture, with subsequent thrombosis and myocardial injury [185] . therefore, clinicians should pay attention to covid-19 patients with coronary heart disease to prevent myocardial injury and myocardial infarction .septic shock can be seen as a serious complication in sars, mers and covid-19[13, 76, 103] . approximately 6.2% of sars-cov-2 infections are complicated by shock [126] . it was reported that left ventricular dysfunction occurs in approximately 20% of patients within 6 hours after the onset of septic shock, and the incidence can increase to 60% by 1 to 3 days after the onset of septic shock [186] . myocardial dysfunction and cardiovascular inflammation might lead to elevated creatine kinase and troponin [187] , which might explain the high hs-tni in deceased patients .in addition to the abovementioned accompanying symptoms, anxiety and stress can also lead to adverse reactions such as accelerated heart rhythms and elevated blood pressure, especially in critically ill patients [188, 189] . health anxiety could be found in coronavirus-infected patients [190] .generally, everyone experiences health anxiety to some degree, and the associated vigilance to a potential health-related threat can be protective.however, excessive health anxiety can be detrimental [190] . the literature indicates that stress can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f and sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in peripheral glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels [191] . high plasma catecholamine levels are associated with an increased risk of heart failure. altered autonomic activity during depression can lead to arrhythmias. the activated sns alters cardiac wall contractility and increases apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes, contributing to cvd development .although there is no relevant study on covid-19 patients suffering from anxiety, medical workers have been reported to be anxious after direct contact with the patients [192, 193] . a study by sun et al. showed that some chinese showed acute posttraumatic stress symptoms during the covid-19 outbreak [194] . therefore, psychological counseling should be conducted on patients in a timely manner, and anxiolytic drugs could be used when necessary .as mentioned above, sars-cov was reported to lead to myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression, which may be responsible for myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars [99] . direct sars-cov infection of cardiomyocytes may also lead to myocarditis and impaired myocardial function. coronavirus-induced myocarditis and its subsequent progression to dilated cardiomyopathy have been described in rabbit models [195] . sars-cov was found in heart samples from patients who died of sars [76] .pathological findings showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration in patients with sars-cov in the heart, with evidence of myocardial damage. mers-cov was not detected in the heart tissue, and the heart showed no significant histological changes in mers patients [111, 112] .however, an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue, implying direct cardiac pathology [113] .although myocarditis was reported in sporadic autopsy cases [128] , there is still no clear pathological evidence supporting that sars-cov-2 can directly cause heart damage .the most frequently used drugs during hospitalization are glucocorticoids and antiviral drugs, as well as antibiotics. the secondary qt interval prolongation caused by the use of drugs during hospitalization cannot be ignored. antiviral drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir), antibiotics (azithromycin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin), antifungal drugs, glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs, there is a potential risk of prolonging the qtc interval [196, 197] . drug-associated qt prolongation is associated with increased arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic mortality and it therefore continues to be an important metric of drug safety [198] .a small study in france enrolling 26 treated patients and 16 non-randomized controls showed that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin shortened the time to resolution of viral shedding of covid-19 [199] . based on this study, clinicians in many countries have begun using these medications in clinical practice, and multiple randomized trials are being initiated. but there were occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging the qt interval and provoking torsade de pointes when used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus [200] [201] [202] [203] . the widely used antibiotic azithromycin was gradually recognized as a rare cause of prolonged qt, severe arrhythmia, and increased risk of sudden death [204] [205] [206] [207] . although there were no reports of arrhythmia death caused by the use of hydroxychloroquine, the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should also be noted [208] .j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o factive support with expected management based on early prognostic indicators may improve recovery. appropriate treatment of heart failure, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis are still important. with continued global cooperation on multiple methods, specific evidence-based treatment strategies for covid-19 will emerge. in order to protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccines will be needed to make a history of covid-19. and some treatment related issues need attention.firstly, the use of acei / arb drugs was controversial in the earlier phase of covid-19 epidemic. but recently published studies suggested that there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei / arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine [60, 61, 209] . some conjectures [210] based on the disease mechanism in the early stage of the outbreak that acei / arb may increase the infection of new coronavirus and the aggravation of covid-19 by increasing the expression of ace2 have been denied by more and more clinical evidence. we see that the continuous treatment of covid-19 patients with hypertension with acei / arb will not only cause the deterioration of the condition, but also continue to exert cardiovascular protection and even improve the prognosis [60, 61, 209] .secondly, we should pay attention to the application of hydroxychloroquine [200] [201] [202] [203] and azithromycin [204] [205] [206] [207] for their side effects of prolonging the qt interval. other drugs used to treat the covid-19 patients, such as antiviral drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir), antibiotics (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin), antifungal drugs, glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs, can cause the qt interval prolongation and should attract more attention. reference by sapp et al. would help to minimize risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia during treatment of covid-19 [211] .thirdly, a recent study from jama reported that the mortality rate of patients with mechanical ventilation treatment was 88.1% [212] . multiple studies around the world have shown that the mortality rate of covid-19 patients using ventilator was still high [213] [214] [215] . and it was believed that the ventilator should be used more cautiously in patients with covid-19, which can reduce the mortality of patients using the ventilator by more than 50% [216] . new guidelines should be established for when to use a ventilator for patients with covid-19. we advocate the application of staged breathing support methods to delay the use of ventilator. simple oxygen treatment like nasal oxygen supply may be safer and more effective.fourth, methylprednisolone are the classical immunosuppressive drugs, which are important to stop or delay the progress of the pneumonia, and have been proved to be effective for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). in recent study [217] , wu at al. found that the administration of methylprednisolone appeared to reduce the risk of death in covid-19 patients with ards. however, of those who received methylprednisolone treatment, 23 of 50 patients died. this is a rather high mortality of ~50%. the indication, timing, dosage and duration, the application of methylprednisolone needs further investigation.fifth, the early report showed that remdesivir was highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro [218] . but recent study published in lancet showed that remdesivir did not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients [219] . however, another clinical trial showed that remdesivir accelerates recovery from advanced covid-19 [220] . another clinical trial showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the 5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir [221] . these data suggested remdesivir does not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients, j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f but have an effect on shortening the course of disease in mild patients. and early medication may be better. the application of remdesivir needs further researches.clinical data indicate that comorbid cardiovascular disease will aggravate the severity of coronavirus infection, leading to a poor prognosis.coronavirus may cause myocardial injury, and the prognosis of patients with complicated myocardial injury is poor. the mechanism of coronavirus causing myocardial injury and drug treatment options remain to be further studied.the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f abbreviation: ck, creatine kinase; ldh, lactate dehydrogenase; hs-tni, hypersensitive troponin i; ckmb, creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme; probnp, pro brain natriuretic peptide; crp,

cb/05 belongs to the ccov-iia subtype, which includes all ''classical'' canine coronavirus strains, with a deletion in orf3b being proposed as a possible genetic marker for the pantropic nature of the strain [10] . recently, recombinant ccov-iib strains were also detected in organs of dogs, though after experimental infection, no systemic signs or virus dissemination through the blood were observed, implying differences in pathobiology among ccov-iia pantropic variants and ccov-iib strains [12, 23] .in greece, the presence of ccov was recently reported for the first time, in a severe outbreak of enteritis in a kennel. by sequence and phylogenetic analysis, high similarity to the pantropic cb/05 strain in the most variable region of the s gene was demonstrated [22] . in the present study, the molecular characterization and sequence analysis findings of a ccov-iia pantropic strain, as well as the need for new genetic markers, are reported.in april 2009, a dead 10-week-old maltese (13/09) male dog was submitted for laboratory investigation, coming from a pet shop in thessaloniki, a city in northern greece. the dog presented inappetence, depression, severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea, vomiting and hypothermia following fever, leading to death one day after the onset of the symptoms. the puppy had been vaccinated with a single dose of a vaccine against canine parvovirus and canine distemper virus three weeks before the onset of the symptoms.during necropsy examination, linear haemorrhages of the intestinal wall, haemorrhagic enteritis and an ulcerated duodenum were observed. multiple areas of emphysema and congestion were found at the lungs. the liver was enlarged, friable and yellow-brown in color with multifocal discolored spots. congested vessels in the dura mater of the brain were also observed.faecal and parenchymatous organ samples were tested, using molecular diagnostic assays described previously, for common canine viral pathogens e.g., ccov [3] , canine parvovirus type 2 (cpv-2) [4, 6, 7] , canine distemper virus (cdv) [15] and canine adenovirus type 1 and type 2 (cav-1 and cav-2) [17] . for ccov typing, quantitation and subtyping in faecal and organ samples, two real-time rt-pcr assays [5] and two rt-pcr assays [13] were carried out.the lung of the dead pup was homogenised (10% w/v) in d-mem together with antibiotics (penicillin 1,000 iu/ml, streptomycin 100 lg/ml), and inoculated into canine fibroma (a-72) cells. infected cells were monitored daily for the occurrence of cytopathic effect (cpe) and, after five days of incubation, they were tested for ccov antigen by an immunofluorescence (if) assay using a cat polyclonal serum specific for members of the species alphacoronavirus 1 and a goat anti-cat igg conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (sigma aldrich, usa). the 3 0 end of the genome of the ccov-iia na/09 strain was amplified as described previously, using viral rna extracted from the spleen, superscript one-step rt-pcr for long templates (invitrogen s.r.l., italy) and six rt-pcr assays, specific for overlapping fragments, encompassing orfs 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4, 5, 6, 7a and 7b [9] . the nucleotide sequence was determined in both directions for each fragment. pcr amplicons were sequenced by a commercial facility (beckman coulter genomics, united kingdom). sequence assembly and analysis were carried out using the bioedit software package [16] and the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) analysis tool. the netnglyk 1.0 server was used for the prediction of n-linked glycosylation sites, signal peptides and transmembrane helices (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/, netglyc, signalp and tmhmm, respectively). phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the mega4 program, and a tree based on the s protein was constructed using the neighbor-joining method [24] .ccov rna was detected in the faeces, lungs, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, heart, liver and brain of the dead puppy. using genotype-specific real-time rt-pcr assays, both genotypes, ccov-i and ccov-ii (5.3 9 10 3 and 6.13 9 10 5 rna copies/ll of template, respectively), were detected in the faeces, while only ccov-ii was detected in all organ samples. in detail, ccov-ii was detected in liver (5.11 9 10 3 rna copies/ll of template), spleen (1.06 9 10 5 rna copies/ll of template), pancreas (7.03 9 10 1 rna copies/ll of template), kidney (1.21 9 10 3 rna copies/ll of template), lungs (7.68 9 10 4 rna copies/ll of template), heart (8.2 9 10 4 rna copies/ll of template) and brain (2.03 9 10 2 rna copies/ll of template). regarding subtype characterization, the ccov-ii strain detected in faecal and in all organ samples was characterized as ccov-iia.despite several attempts, the virus was not adapted to growth in vitro, as demonstrated by the absence of cytopathic effect in inoculated cells and by negative results in the if assay, even after three passages on cell cultures.regarding other canine viral pathogens, the dog tested positive for a cpv-2a field strain.a total of 8,809 nucleotides were determined for strain na/09, encompassing orfs 2 (s protein), 3a, 3b, 3c, 4 (e protein), 5 (m protein), 6 (n protein), 7a and 7b. alignment of an 8,767-nucleotide part of the sequence with tgev, ccov and fcov reference strains available in genbank showed the highest identity to ccov-iia pantropic reference strain cb/05 (dq112226) (97.7%). the minimum conserved signal for transcription (ctaaac) was present upstream of all of the orfs (orf 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7).the spike protein gene was 4,365 nucleotides long, encoding a protein of 1,454 amino acids. when compared to strain cb/05, no insertions or deletions were observed. the spike protein of na/09, when compared with the analogous proteins of ccov, tgev and fcov reference strains, showed the highest similarity to cb/05 (98.2% aa) ( table 1) . analysis using the netnglyk 1.0 server showed that the protein contained a putative signal peptide (cleavage sites at positions ser 19 to thr 20, as in strain cb/05) and a transmembrane domain (positions 1,394 -1,416 of the s gene). the s protein contained 31 potential n-linked glycosylation sites. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the greek strain was more closely related to the cb/05 pantropic reference strain detected in dogs' organs (fig. 1) .the genomic region located between the s and e genes of both strains was found to encode three presumptive nonstructural proteins. nsp3a, 3b and 3c proteins were 78, 71 and 244 amino acids long, respectively. regarding orf3b, the 38-nucleotide deletion of the cb/05 was not observed (fig. 2) .the envelope protein was found to be 82 amino acids in length, like in most canine coronavirus strains. a transmembrane domain was predicted between residue 15 and 37. the greek strain had 100% amino acid identity to cb/ 05 and to two ccov-iib strains detected in dogs' organs (119/08 and 341/05). the membrane protein (m protein) was found to be 262 amino acids long. it contained three potential n-linked glycosylation sites, a putative signal peptide (cleavage sites at positions gly 16 to glu 17) and three transmembrane domains (positions 47-69, 76-98 and 113-135). the m protein had the highest amino acid sequence identity to those of the ccov-iib reference strains (119/08 and 430/07) and to that of cb/05 (99.6% and 99.2%, respectively). the n protein (nucleoprotein) was found to be 382 amino acids in length. the greek strain shared the highest amino acid identity with ccov-iib 119/08 and cb/05 (99.7% and 99.4%, respectively). orf7 of both strains was found to encode two presumptive non-structural proteins. nsp7a and 7b were 101 and 213 amino acids in length, and they were conserved with respect to the ccov-ii reference strains.coronaviruses are characterized by high genetic diversity. the high frequency of mutations, due to the high rate of mistakes of the rna-dependent rna polymerase, as well as frequent recombination are considered the main mechanisms of coronaviruses evolution, leading to the emergence of new strains, subtypes and genotypes within species and changes regarding tissue or even host tropism [26] . in the present study, a ccov strain, spreading to the internal organs, was detected and analysed by molecular techniques. by means of sequence and phylogenetic analysis, a high similarity to the pantropic cb/05 variant was shown. this study, the second one reporting the genetic characterization of a ccov pantropic strain, suggests that pantropic ccov variants are present in greece and can be associated with fatal disease in puppies [9] . however, the observed mortality could be due to the dual cpv/pantropic ccov infection, considering that mixed infections usually display a more severe course and higher mortality [8] . in addition, recent studies have demonstrated that the outcome of cb/05 infection is not invariably lethal, but, at least under experimental conditions, its main consequence is represented by a profound, long-lasting lymphopenia involving both b and t cells [20] .by means of real-time rt-pcr, the tissue distribution of na/09 was determined. viral rna was detected in several parenchymatous organs and in high concentration, suggesting the pantropic nature of the variant. detection and quantitation of the viral rna in the heart and the pancreas is reported for the first time. the detection of ccov-i, which was restricted to the faecal samples, suggests that the pantropic na/09 strain has the advantage of disseminating in the organism, revealing differences in the pathobiology of the pantropic variants with respect to common ccov enteric strains.regarding ccov, mutations are considered to play a key role in the emergence of the pantropic variant cb/05 [9] . the truncated form of orf3b, observed in cb/05, was not present in na/09. that mutation was considered to be a possible genetic marker for pantropic variants [9] . however, similar deletions in orf3b have been observed in common enteric strains, as in 1-71 (fig. 2) [19] , and truncated nsp3b has been associated with attenuated coronavirus strains [25] . on the other hand, a high similarity in the s protein was observed between na/09 and cb/05 strains. since the s protein is responsible for receptor attachment and changes in tissue tropism have been associated with mutations in the s gene [18, 21] , it is likely that specific genetic markers for pantropic strains will be identified in this region.in conclusion, in the present study, the detection, quantitation and molecular analysis of a pantropic ccov variant is reported. in addition, it is suggested that pantropic variants can be identified in the heart and the pancreas. the emergence of strains that are able to disseminate and cause systemic infection suggests that canine coronaviral infections may be more interesting and severe than thought in the past. further studies are necessary in order to determine the circulation of pantropic ccov strains among the dog population and to identify specific genetic markers that can be useful for understanding virus pathobiology and epidemiology. cryptosporidium spp. is an apicomplexan enteropathogen of a wide range of vertebrate hosts including humans. cryptosporidial infection is common in calves and could cause severe diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, and dehydration leading to substantial economic losses mainly related to reductions in weight gain and the application of palliative and preventive treatments. although calves with cryptosporidiosis may recover after 4-6 weeks (olson et al. 2004 ), a mortality rate of 35.5% in younger animals than 30 days has also been reported (singh et al. 2006) .high herd prevalence of cryptosporidium spp. has been reported in dairies, with values ranging from 50.5 to 96% (hamnes et al. 2006; brook et al. 2008; trotz-williams et al. 2008; silverlås et al. 2009; tiranti et al. 2011; smith et al. 2014; delafosse et al. 2015; al mawly et al. 2015) . it has been section editor: lihua xiao electronic supplementary material the online version of this article (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06366-y) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.reported that cryptosporidiosis risk is higher in calves younger than 30 days old (tiranti et al. 2011; smith et al. 2014; delafosse et al. 2015; avendaño et al. 2018) .mainly, four cryptosporidium species have been reported in cattle, cryptosporidium parvum, cryptosporidium bovis, cryptosporidium andersoni, and cryptosporidium ryanae (santín et al. 2008; ryan et al. 2014 ). among them, c. parvum and c. bovis are the most common species identified in pre-weaned calves. c. parvum can be transmitted to humans via the fecal/oral route, following direct or indirect contact with infected animals (ryan et al. 2014; kinross et al. 2015) . cattle are recognized as a major parasite reservoir and contributor of zoonotic infection, because c. parvum subtypes infecting humans have been isolated from cattle (xiao and fayer 2008) . c. parvum is an important zoonotic pathogen responsible for serious human diarrhea outbreaks in industrialized countries, affecting especially immunocompromised individuals (hiv patients), children, and the elderly (xiao and feng 2008) . in developing countries, cryptosporidium infection has been found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of deaths in toddlers with diarrhea aged 12-23 months (kotloff et al. 2013) .molecular tools have allowed to define and assess the genetic diversity of cryptosporidium facilitating the quest to unravel transmission patterns and associated impacts on public health (thompson and ash 2016) . in order to assess a possible transmission source of c. parvum, intraspecific subtyping based on the 60 kda glycoprotein (gp60) gene is commonly used (xiao 2010) . accordingly, identification of cryptosporidium intraspecific variation has been central in understanding transmission dynamics of zoonotic parasite strains. molecular characterization of c. parvum at the subtype level in dairy calves, important to determine zoonotic potential, have been conducted in several countries (santín et al. 2008; xiao and fayer 2008; amer et al. 2010; silverlås et al. 2013; smith et al. 2014; kaupke and rzeżutka 2015) . in argentina, two previous studies have reported c. parvum as the only species present in 120 preweaned dairy calves and subtypes iiaa16g1r1 iiaa17g1r1, iiaa18g1r1, iiaa19g1r1, iiaa20g1r1, iiaa21g1r1, iiaa22g1r1, and iiaa23g1r1 have been identified (tomazic et al. 2013; del coco et al. 2014) . whereas an association between subtypes and different clinical manifestations has been demonstrated in humans, few studies have tested the hypothesis that c. parvum-subtypes are associated with diarrhea intensity in dairy calves insulander et al. 2013; adamu et al. 2014) .the aim of this study was to determine (i) cryptosporidium prevalence in calves, herds, and within-herd and (ii) the presence of cryptosporidium species and c. parvum subtypes in calves with diarrhea from intensive dairy farms in central argentina. table 1 ). this area included 564 dairy herds (indec 2008) , of which the herd size of 68% range from 101 to 500 cows (sánchez et al. 2012 ).farms were selected from a database of the producer's rural association, registered in the local execution unit villa maría, general san martín district in córdoba, argentina. the inclusion criterion for dairy farms was a size of 101 to 300 cows as based on january 2013 data. based on sample size calculations, a total of 60 farms were required to estimate a 19.3% prevalence with 9% precision and were randomly selected from 365 dairies (epidat 3.1).exclusively calves younger than 60 days of age were sampled. individual fecal samples were taken directly from the rectum using sterile plastic gloves and were stored at 4 to 8°c until processing. at the moment of sample collection, feces consistency and presence of diarrhea were registered. fecal consistency was scored as follows, solid (s), semisolid (ss), liquid (l), runny (r), and meconium (m). diarrhea was defined as runny or liquid feces (mcguirk 2008 ).samples were processed with the formol-ether concentration technique (young et al. 1979) ; the supernatant was removed, leaving a final pellet volume of 2 ml. fecal smears were prepared with 50 μl of each pellet. presence of cryptosporidium oocysts was detected by microscopic examination at × 1000 magnification using the modified ziehl-neelsen technique (henriksen and pohlenz 1981) (fig. 2) . intensity of cryptosporidium infection was scored semi-quantitatively according to the average number of oocysts in 20 randomly selected fields as follows: 0 (no oocysts), 1 (1-5 oocysts), 2 (6-10 oocysts), 3 (11-15 oocysts), and 4 (≥ 16 oocysts) (chartier et al. 2013 ). all tests were performed by one person.cryptosporidium oocysts were concentrated from oocystpositive fecal samples using the sucrose flotation protocol of coklin et al. (2007) . oocysts were ruptured with three freeze-thaw cycles, and total dna was extracted with the qiamp dna stool mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) following the instructions of the manufacturer. for species determination, genomic dna isolated from oocyst-positive fecal samples were subjected to pcr-rflp as described in xiao et al. (1999) including the use of an additional restriction enzyme mboii (feng et al. 2007 ). for subtyping, c. parvum isolates were selected from calves with diarrhea and high infection intensity (scores 3 and 4), and the pcr amplicon of the gene encoding the 60 kda glycoprotein (gp60) was directly sequenced and subtyped (alves et al. 2003) . gp60 subtypes were designated based on the number of trinucleotides tca and tcg and the hexanucleotide acatca in the polymorphic tandem repeat region (sulaiman et al. 2005) . nucleotide sequences were deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers kx768771-kx768816.cryptosporidium parvum overall, herd, and within-herd prevalence was calculated for all calves. a chi-square test (χ 2 ) was used to compare the frequency of c. parvum infection in diarrheic and healthy animals and to assess the association between calf age and the occurrence of c. parvum subtype-infection. all analyses were performed with the statistical software r 3.2.3.from the 60 herds selected, six were excluded; since three farms had incorrect contact data, two farms send their calves to a collective artificial breeding system, and one farm had sold all animals at the time of the study. altogether, a total of 1073 fecal samples were collected in the remaining 54 dairy herds corresponding to an average of 20 samples per herd (range 10 to 66). of all sampled calves, 22% (236/1073) presented diarrhea (95% c.i. 19.5, 24.5).of 1073 sampled calves, 282 (26.3%) were positive for oocysts excretion after microscopic examination. prevalence of oocyst excretion for calves of one, two, three, and four or more weeks of age was found to be 11.9% (12/101), 46.2% (141/ 305), 29.5% (99/336), and 9% (30/331), respectively.genomic dna was isolated from oocyst-positive samples and subjected to pcr-rflp for cryptosporidium species determination. eight samples with a low infection intensity (score 1) failed to amplify, whereas the pcr-rflp pattern fig. 2 cryptosporidium oocysts under microscopic examination of fecal smears at × 1000 magnification using the modified ziehl-neelsen technique of the remaining 274 samples identified c. parvum resulting in a prevalence of 25.5% (95% c.i. 22.9; 28.1%) in the study area. of the 274 c. parvum-positive samples, 35% (96) displayed a low (score 1), 41% (113) a medium (score 2), 13% (36) a high (score 3), and 11% (29) a very high (score 4) infection intensity. with regard of feces consistency, 17% (63/372) of c. parvum-positive calves displayed feces that had been graded to be of solid (s), 24% (104/432) semisolid (ss), 44% (39/89) liquid (l), 45% (66/147) runny (r), and 6% (2/33) meconium (m) consistency.in 48 of 54 herds, at least one c. parvum positive calf was identified resulting in an overall herd prevalence of 89%. c. parvum within-herd prevalence was lower, ranging from 0 to 57% (mean 25%; first quartile 14.7%; third quartile 36%) and in 50% of herds, c. parvum within-herd prevalence was higher than average (fig. 3) . diarrhea was absent in six herds; in three of these, no oocysts were detected, while in the three remaining only one or two c. parvum-positive calves with a low infection intensity (score 1) were found.from 65 c. parvum-positive calves exhibiting a high (score 3) and very high infection intensity (score 4), 47 samples of diarrheal calves were selected for amplification and gp60 gene sequencing. all analyzed c. parvum gp60 subtypes belonged to the iia family. altogether, five c. parvum gp60 subtypes (iiaa18g1r1, iiaa20g1r1, iiaa21g1r1, iiaa22g1r1, and iiaa24g1r1) could be identified (table 1) . interestingly, in all gp60 alleles, a non-synonymous nucleotide exchange from bgac^to bggc^was observed, corresponding to an exchange of asn to gly at amino acid site 99, as previously reported (tomazic et al. 2013) .a highly significant association was found between diarrhea presence and c. parvum infection (χ 2 = 55.89, p < 0.001, supplementary table 2 ). the predominant subtype in calves with diarrhea and high infection intensity was iiaa20g1r1 (25/47), followed by iiaa18g1r1 (12/47). additionally, a novel subtype, iiaa24g1r1 was determined in two calves.no statistically significant relationship was found between calf age and a specific subtype presence (p = 0.49, supplementary table 3) . nevertheless, particular subtypes were present only in animals of a certain age. for example, iiaa21g1r1, iiaa22g1r1, and iiaa24g1r1 subtypes were observed only in animals of 2 weeks of age or less. in contrast, the iiaa18g1r1 subtype was found exclusively in calves 2 weeks of age or older, while the most predominant subtype, iiaa20g1r1, was identified in all ages. furthermore, all subtypes were found to be not clustered but individually distributed in different dairy herds (supplementary table 4 ).cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves is widespread (brook et al. 2008; trotz-williams et al. 2008; al mawly et al. 2015; qi et al. 2015) , and also in the present study, c. parvum was, in agreement with previous reports in argentina, the only species identified in calves (tomazic et al. 2013; del coco et al. 2014) . however, in contrast to previous studies done in argentina, a considerably higher overall prevalence was found (del coco et al. 2008; tiranti et al. 2011; garro et al. 2016) , probably due to an additional oocysts concentration step prior to microscopic examination significantly increasing the sensitivity of oocyst detection. in the present study, the sampling fraction of calves ≤ 30 days of age was 83% (888/1073), which is the age range were c. parvum is most frequently found (santín et al. 2008; xiao 2010; ryan et al. 2014) . delafosse et al. (2015) found that a high infection intensity (scores 3 or 4) predicted an increased mortality rate of calves 90 days of age. based on this finding, it is anticipated that 23.7% of oocyst-excreting calves (or 6.1% of the studied calves) in the present study may be subjected to an increased mortality.at least one c. parvum-positive calf was detected in 89% of the herds studied. highly variable herd prevalence ranging from 50.5 to 96% have been reported (hamnes et al. 2006; brook et al. 2008; trotz-williams et al. 2008; silverlås et al. 2009; tiranti et al. 2011; smith et al. 2014; al mawly et al. 2015; delafosse et al. 2015; garro et al. 2016; avendaño et al. 2018) . similar to the considerable differences of overall prevalence that have been reported, corresponding dissimilarities in herd prevalence may likewise be attributed to the different sensitivities of applied diagnostic test. accordingly, garro et al. (2016) estimated a herd prevalence of 67% (overall prevalence 16.3%) compared with 89% (overall prevalence 26.3%) in the present study. other factors that may bias towards lower herd prevalence values, maybe the sampling of a smaller age range or a higher number of older animals (30-60 days). in addition, also, a lower number of calves sampled in each herd may significantly reduce the probability of finding positive calves particularly in herds with very low prevalence. since only one fecal sample from each calf was examined, the true prevalence value may have been underestimated in the present study.diarrhea was not observed in 6 herds, 3 of which tested negative for all animals. interestingly, the 3 remaining herds presented 1 or 2 c. parvum positive calves with low infection intensity score (score 1). a highly significant association was found between the presence of diarrhea and c. parvum infection, reinforcing the notion that this enteropathogen is most relevant for diarrhea development in neonatal dairy calves (izzo et al. 2011; al mawly et al. 2015; meganck et al. 2015; garro et al. 2017 ). nevertheless, the association of c. parvum with diarrhea may be overestimated since possible co-infections with other microorganisms were not evaluated.noteworthy, a novel subtype iiaa24g1r1 could be identified in two different calves of the same herd. both animals showed profuse diarrhea, high-level of dehydration and, though treated, eventually died. further laboratory testing excluded salmonella spp., enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec), rotavirus, and coronavirus as primary cause of death (data not shown).besides the novel iiaa24g1r1 subtype, the remaining 4 subtypes reported in this study have been previously detected in argentina. high genetic variability has been found in dairy calves in argentina. tomazic et al. (2013) reported the six subtypes iiaa17g1r1, iiaa18g1r1, iiaa20g1r1, (tomazic et al. 2013 , del coco et al. 2014 england (2 of 51) (brook et al. 2009) the netherlands (2 of 129) (wielinga et al. 2008) sweden (3 of 171) czech republic (3 of 137) (kváč et al. 2011) hungary (1 of (tomazic et al. 2013; del coco et al. 2014) . in england, this subtype has been also identified in humans (chalmers et al. 2011) , strongly suggesting a zoonotic transmission risk. in contrast, a recent study carried out in argentinean and brazilian persons, c. hominis was frequently detected (peralta et al. 2016) and none of c. parvum subtypes reported in this study were found. further research is required to understand the real clinical significance of each c. parvum subtype, as well as their interaction when co-infections occur. the presence of at least one c. parvum zoonotic subtype in dairy calves implies transmission to humans. consequently, molecular epidemiology studies in humans, especially in farm workers that are in close contact with c. parvum-infected animals, may further substantiate the existence of zoonotic transmission of the parasite.the current study revealed that cryptosporidium parvum is widely distributed in dairy calf operations. the five c. parvum gp60 subtypes iiaa18g1r1, iiaa20g1r1, iiaa21g1r1, iiaa22g1r1, and a novel iiaa24g1r1 variant were identified. the most commonly detected subtypes in calves with diarrhea and high infection intensity score were iiaa20g1r1 and iiaa18g1r1. subtype iiaa18g1r1 was frequently found in this study and is strongly implicated in zoonotic transmission suggesting that calves might be an important source of human cryptosporidiosis in argentina. however, to confirm this hypothesis, studies in humans are required.funding this project was supported by the proyectos y programas de investigación-universidad nacional de río cuarto (fomento no. a338), agencia nacional de la promoción científica y tecnológica (anpcyt) (pict 2013 -1708 , pict 2012 , and fundación universidad de morón (pid 8-2015) . the authors acknowledge the students georgina matteo, santiago hernandez, and maria luz gomez vega for sample processing and field visits and all participating producers.conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.ethics all procedures performed in studies involving animals were in accordance with the standards of the research ethics committee of the universidad nacional de río cuarto (approval number 47/11 and 173/16).as cats continue to become more popular as household companions and pets [1] , a variety of viral infections pose a serious threat to felines, including a high incidence of feline leukemia virus (felv) [2] , feline coronavirus (fcov) [3] , feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) [4] , and feline panleukopenia virus (fpv) [5] . currently, the only preventative vaccines and therapeutic drugs available for use in pet cats have limited effectiveness. nevertheless, interferons (ifns) play an increasingly complementary role inhomology and phylogenetic tree analysis of the feline ifn-ω genes isolated in this study were analyzed using dnastar and mega7 software. in addition, the characteristics of the feifn-ω genes and proteins were analyzed by several online bioinformatics software programs:signal peptide cleavage sites were analyzed by the signalp 3.0 server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/signalp-3.0/; phosphorylation sites were analyzed by the netphos3.1 server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netphos/; n-glycosylation sites were analyzed by the netnglyc1.0 server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netnglyc/; o-glycosylation sites were analyzed by the yinoyang1.2 server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/yinoyang/; subcellular localization was analyzed by the targetp 1.1 server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/targetp; transmembrane regions were analyzed by the tmhmm 2.0 server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/; antigen epitopes and hydrophobicity were analyzed by the bepipred 1.0 server at http://www.cbs.dtu. dk/services/bepipred-1.0/; and secondary and three-dimensional structures were predicted by sopma at https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa.in this study, the genes encoding feifn-ω that were isolated by rt-pcr were subcloned as a kpni and bamhi-generated (new england biolabs, ma, usa) gene fragment into the prokaryotic soluble expression plasmid pcold-tf, giving rise to recombinant pcold-feifn-ω. after that, the recombinant plasmid was transformed into e. coli bl21 (de3) competent cells and validated by pcr and sequencing analyses, thus generating the recombinant e. coli strain pcold-feifn-ω/bl21. we then used sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis to determine the optimal conditions for expression of the recombinant feifn-ω in pcold-feifn-ω/bl21 cells via induction by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (iptg, sigma, st. louis, mo, usa). briefly, for optimization of the iptg concentration, the recombinant e. coli strain was grown in luria-bertani broth (sigma, st. louis, mo, usa) supplemented with 100 µg/ml ampicillin at 37 • c until the optical density at 600 nm was approximately 0.5. then, iptg was added at final concentrations of 0.4 mmol/l, 0.6 mmol/l, 0.8 mmol/l, 1.0 mmol/l, or 1.2 mmol/l, and the cultures were continually cultivated for viruses 2020, 12, 335 4 of 16 another 6 h. after centrifugation at 12,000× g for 10 min, the cell pellets were lysed and analyzed by 12% sds-page. to determine the optimal induction time, the recombinant strain was induced by the optimized final concentration of iptg for 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, and 12 h. following centrifugation and cells lysis, the proteins were again analyzed by 12% sds-page.the fusion protein expressed by the pcold-feifn-ω/bl21 bacteria cells was subjected to cleavage by the 3c protease (sigma, st. louis, mo, usa). the target recombinant feifn-ω protein was then purified using ni 2+ affinity chromatography columns according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by confirmation analysis using sds-page. the purified feifn-ω protein was stored at −80 • c until use. vsv was used as a virus model to evaluate the antiviral activity of the recombinant feifn-ω via the in vitro microdose cytopathic effect inhibition assay (mcia) according to the method described previously [12, 26] with slight modifications. briefly, 100 µl of the purified feifn-ω sample was serially diluted ten-fold in dmem containing 10% fbs and transferred to confluent f81 cell monolayers in 96-well cell culture plates, and then incubated at 37 • c in 5% co 2 for 18 h. f81 cells without ifn treatment were used as a control group. after incubation, vsv (moi = 1) was prepared as described above, added into the 96-well plate, and incubated for 8-12 h until the cpe of the cells in the viral control group reached 100%. next, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 20% ethanol at 37 • c for 30 min. the cells were then destained with 0.1% acetic acid in 50% ethanol at 37 • c for 5 min before determining the absorbance of each well at 595 nm. each sample was performed with eight biological replicates and three technical replicates. the antiviral activity of the ifn was calculated as the method previously described, which is expressed as units per milligram according to the ratio of ifn titer and protein concentration [27] . in parallel, the intercat ifn antiviral drug (toray industries, tokyo, japan) was used as an ifn treatment control. in addition, we determined the species-specific antiviral activity of the recombinant feifn-ω by conducting mcias using vsv in f81, vero, mdck, mdbk, and pk-15 cells. broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the recombinant feifn-ω was determined by conducting mcias using vsv, fcov, cpv, bvdv, and pedv.the results are shown as mean ± sem (n = 3) for three independent experiments. statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism v5.0 software. tukey's multiple comparison tests and one-way analysis of variance (anova) tests were used to analyze the significance of the differences between groups: * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; and *** p < 0.001.we first collected splenic lymphocytes from cats infected with vsv and treated with poly(i:c) simultaneously. we then performed rt-pcr assays using a pair of degenerate primers to identify two genes encoding feifn-ω, referred to as feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb ( figure 1a) . these two novel genes were deposited in the genbank with accession numbers mk682680 and mk682681. following nucleotide sequence homology analysis, we found that the feifn-ωa gene (mk682680), with a size of 591 bp, shared a maximum nucleotide sequence homology of 91.88% (91.6% amino acid homology) with the 13 known subtypes of feifn-ω (feifn-ω1 to feifn-ω13) genes published in the genbank (figure 1c ). the feifn-ωb gene (mk682681), with a size of 612 bp, shared a maximum sequence homology of 90.20% (89.4% amino acid homology) with the 13 known subtypes of feifn-ω ( figure 1d ). the sequence homology shared between the feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb genes was only 83.01% (figure 1b) , indicating that the two genes identified in this study were novel feifn-ω genes. we constructed a phylogenetic tree comparing the feifn-ωa/ωb genes identified in this study with other ifn gene sequences published in genbank from different animals using the software dnastar (megalign) and mega7. the results showed that the feifn-ωa/ωb genes belonged in the type i ifn family, but that their evolutionary relationship to the known feline ifn-ω genes already published in the genbank (figure 2 ) was distant, indicating that the feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb genes, identified for the first time here, are new subtypes of feline ifn-ω.viruses 2020, 12, x for peer review 6 of 16we constructed a phylogenetic tree comparing the feifn-ωa/ωb genes identified in this study with other ifn gene sequences published in genbank from different animals using the software dnastar (megalign) and mega7. the results showed that the feifn-ωa/ωb genes belonged in the type i ifn family, but that their evolutionary relationship to the known feline ifn-ω genes already published in the genbank (figure 2 ) was distant, indicating that the feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb genes, identified for the first time here, are new subtypes of feline ifn-ω. the characteristics of the novel feline ifn-ω proteins (feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb) were analyzed using several online bioinformatics software programs, including the identification of potential signal peptide cleavage sites, n-glycosylation sites, o-glycosylation sites, phosphorylation sites, subcellular localization, and transmembrane regions. the results from these detailed analyses are displayed in table 1 . in addition, we also used online software algorithms to predict antigen epitopes, hydrophobicity, and the secondary and three-dimensional structures of the feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb proteins. as shown in figure figure 3b ). the maximum hydrophobicity of feifn-ωa was 1.92, and the minimum hydrophobicity was −2.27. the maximum hydrophobicity of feifn-ωb was 2.27, and the minimum hydrophobicity was −2.36. the secondary structure of the two feifn-ω proteins was predicted using sopma software and revealed that feifn-ωa contained 62.24% alpha helix, 2.55% beta sheet, and 34.18% irregular curl structures (figure 3c ), whereas feifn-ωb contained 65.52% alpha helix, 1.97% beta sheet, and 31.53% irregular curl structures ( figure 3d ). the three-dimensional structures of feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb were predicted with swiss-model software and are shown in figure 3e ,f, respectively.

primarily expressed in their soluble forms. subsequently, we optimized the expression conditions of the rfeifn-ω proteins from the pcold-feifn-ωa/bl21 and pcold-feifn-ωb/bl21 e. coli strains. our observations indicated that the optimal induction conditions for rfeifn-ωa protein expression were an iptg concentration of 1.0 mmol/l ( figure 4c ) and an induction time of 8 h (figure 4d) , and the optimal induction conditions for rfeifn-ωb protein expression were an iptg concentration of 0.8 mmol/l ( figure 4e ) and an induction time of 10 h (figure 4f ). after that, the fused proteins (rfeifn-ωa/ωb+tf) were purified by his-tag ni 2+ affinity column chromatography and subjected to cleavage using the 3c protease. the cleaved proteins were then purified by his-tag ni 2+ affinity column chromatography once again, after which we collected the purified recombinant rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb proteins with molecular weights of approximately 21 kda and 22 kda, respectively ( figure 4g

assays (mcias) and vsv as the viral model that was propagated on f81 cells. as shown in figure 5 , both rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb demonstrated good antiviral activity similar to the intercat ifn (feline

animal species, including f81 cells (cat), vero cells (monkey), mdck cells (dog), mdbk cells (cattle), and pk-15 cells (pig). as shown in figure 6 , the purified recombinant feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb

significantly weak antiviral activity in mdck and mdbk cells, and no antiviral activity in pk-15 cells. furthermore, the antiviral activity of rfeifn-ωb was better than that of rfeifn-ωa in homologous

household pets. we know of a wide variety of viral infections that can seriously endanger the health of pet cats, such as felv, fiv, fipv, fcov, and feline calicivirus (fcv). interferon represents a promising potential therapeutic agent that can effectively treat pet cats infected with these viruses. in this study, we identified two new genes encoding feline ifn-ω (feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb) in the spleen lymphocytes of cats. following sequence homology analysis, we found that feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb shared maximum nucleotide sequence homologies of 91.88% and 90.20%, and maximum amino acid homologies of 91.6% and 89.4% with the 13 previously published subtypes of feline ifn-ω, respectively. in addition, phylogenetic tree analysis of ifns in cats and other species constructed using neighbor-joining analysis revealed that feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb do belong to the type i ifn family, but their evolutionary relationship to known feline ifn-ω genes was distant, indicating that feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb were indeed new subtypes of feline ifn-ω. we deposited these two genes into the genbank with the accession numbers mk682680 (feifn-ωa) and mk682681 (feifn-ωb), thus enriching the ifn-ω data submitted to the genbank [12] .in this study, the characteristics of the feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb proteins, such as signal peptide sequences, signal peptide cleavage sites, phosphorylation sites, glycosylation sites, antigen epitopes, hydrophobicity, and transmembrane regions were analyzed using bioinformatics to provide better theoretical guidance for the functional study of these proteins. the mature proteins, with normal biological activity, were formed only after the signal peptide sequence was removed from the precursor protein, thus allowing them to be secreted outside the cell membrane [28, 29] . we used online software to predict that the signal peptide sequence of the feifn-ωa/ωb proteins consists of 23 amino acid residues, and that the signal peptide cleavage site is located between residues gly23 and cys24. the results indicated that the recombinant feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb proteins could be expressed in vitro in their soluble forms. glycosylation is an important post-translational modification process that can affect the antigenic determinants, charge properties, enzymatic properties, and thermal stability of proteins. similar to previous reports for the 13 known feifn-ω subtypes [12] , we observed no n-glycosylation sites present in feifn-ωa or feifn-ωb. however, our analyses predicted nine potential o-glycosylation sites in feifn-ωa and six potential o-glycosylation sites in feifn-ωb, which is different from previous reports on the other known ifn-ω subtypes [6] . studies have shown that glycosylation sites can play an important role in determining the activity of ifns [30, 31] . for example, glycosylated ifn-ω has been observed to be markedly more potent than non-glycosylated ifn-ω against hepatitis c virus, bvdv, yellow fever virus, and west nile virus, with even more superior effects than ifn-α, ifn-β, and ifn-γ [6, 30] .insect/baculovirus expression systems are one of the most effective eukaryotic expression systems for preparing feline ifns. these expression systems are capable of making post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which allows proteins to fold correctly, thus producing highly active and stable ifns [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . however, the application of these systems is limited by drawbacks, such as low yield of ifn protein and complicated operation requirements [37] . therefore, e. coli expression systems are still the most widely used prokaryotic expression system for protein production with their characteristics of simple procedures, large-scale production, and low cost [38] [39] [40] . generally, recombinant ifn is produced by e. coli expression systems in an insoluble inclusion body form that has not been modified or folded correctly, resulting in the loss of its biological activity [41, 42] . to obtain a soluble and biologically active ifn protein, the inclusion bodies need to be denatured and then renatured, which is a time-consuming, laborious process [40] . in this study, we selected the prokaryotic soluble expression system pcold-tf to prepare recombinant feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb. the pcold-tf system is a highly efficient soluble expression system with a his-tagged tf that allows the expressed protein to be effectively modified, folded, and secreted into the cytoplasm [43, 44] . following the construction of recombinant e. coli strains and induction by iptg, the rfeifn-ωa/ωb proteins were expressed in their soluble forms and analyzed via sds-page. we optimized expression conditions for the rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb proteins and purified them using his-tag ni 2+ affinity column chromatography. both proteins showed antiviral activity against vsv in microdose cytopathic effect inhibition assays using f81 cells. our results provide a basis for further studies into the development of rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb as therapeutic agents for viral infections. meanwhile, our data provide evidence that the pcold-tf expression system can be used to produce ifn with full bioactivity.recombinant feline interferon-ω (rfeifn-ω) was the first licensed immunomodulator for use in treating viral infections in cats, especially fiv and felv infections [17, 18, 45] . furthermore, rfeifn-ω also exhibits therapeutic effects against other feline viral infections, such as fcv, feline parvovirus, and feline herpesvirus-1 [45] , as well as viruses that originate in other animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus, influenza virus, bvdv, vsv, prv, and rotavirus [6, 12, 18] . in this study, our results demonstrated that both rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb had antiviral activity in homologous animal cells (f81 cells, cat) and heterologous animal cells (vero cells, monkey; mdbk cells, cattle; mdck cells, dog; pk-15 cells, pig), indicating that rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb have broad cross-species antiviral activity in vitro, similar to previously published findings in mdbk and mdck cells [12] . in contrast, the antiviral activities of rfeifn-ωb in homologous and heterologous animal cells were better than that of rfeifn-ωa. intriguingly, the rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb proteins exhibited antiviral activity in mdck cells, despite the absence of ifn-ω in canines [46, 47] . we speculate that different ifns with different physiological functions are likely responsible for the difference of results obtained in our study compared to other published studies. furthermore, analysis of the broad-spectrum antiviral activities of rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb revealed that they were effective against vsv, fcov, pedv, bvdv, and cpv. out of those five viruses, antiviral activity was strongest against vsv and fcov. no significant differences in antiviral activity against cpv, bvdv, or pedv were observed between rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb. however, the overall broad-spectrum antiviral activity of rfeifn-ωb was significantly stronger than that of rfeifn-ωa.recently, combination antiviral therapy has become a common practice in treating feline viral infections due to pharmacokinetics and the short half-life of ifn alone [48, 49] . there are many published studies focused on the combination of ifn-ω with other therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapeutic agents [50] , ifn-α [51] , and ribavirin [6] , suggesting this is an attractive strategy to use against viral infections. we further evaluated the antiviral effects of rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb combined with feline il-18 against vsv and fcov in f81 cells. our results revealed that the in vitro antiviral activity of combination therapy was significantly increased compared to that of rfeifn-ωa or rfeifn-ωb alone, indicating that rfeifn-ω combination therapy may represent a more potent option than monotherapy for treating viral infections in cats; however, this hypothesis requires further exploration in vivo. in summary, the rfeifn-ωa and rfeifn-ωb obtained in this study exhibit significant broad-spectrum antiviral activity in both homologous and heterologous cells in vitro, particularly rfeifn-ωb, suggesting a promising candidate for the development of an effective therapeutic agent against viral infections in cats and other animals.in this study, two new subtypes of feline ifn-ω (ωa and ωb) were identified and characterized. they shared a maximum nucleotide sequence homology of 91.88% and 90.20% and a maximum amino acid homology of 91.6% and 89.4% with the 13 previously known subtypes of feifn-ω, respectively. we analyzed the characteristics of feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb in detail using bioinformatics followed by soluble expression and optimization of induction conditions in e. coli. our data showed that purified recombinant feifn-ωa and feifn-ωb had broad-spectrum antiviral activity in homologous and heterologous animal cells, suggesting they are candidates for the development of effective therapeutic agents to be used against viral infections in pet cats. and, our research is underway to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the two novel feifns as therapeutics agent for cat viral infections in vivo. in addition, the reported feifn-ω sequences will enrich the ifn data submitted to genbank. is known as a zoonosis in the case where the virus is transmitted from non-human hosts to humans and causes disease [6] .crossing the species barrier is an unpredictable event that involves complex interactions between the virus and the newly adopted host [7] . the hiv virus and contemporary human influenza viruses are prominent examples of viruses that have crossed the species barrier and established themselves permanently in the human population without further dependence on the presence of the original animal host reservoir. fortunately, natural adaptation of a new virus leading to permanent establishment and dissemination within the human population is a rare event [8] . often, the virus is not readily adapted to infect and spread efficiently from human to human. the emergence of new viral infections often follows environmental, ecological and technological changes caused by human activities [9] . these activities may lead to an increased contact between humans and animal hosts acting as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses. agricultural development, an increased exploitation of environmental resources, growth and increase in the mobility of the human population and trade and transportation of food and livestock, have been identified as important factors contributing to the introduction and spread of a number of new viruses in the human population [10] [11] [12] [13] .the road map for cross-species transfer may differ for individual viruses. however, some common underlying factors that affect the probability of zoonotic events can be identified ( table 1 ). the potential of viruses to adapt to new or changing cellular environments or ecological niches via genetic variation appears to be a key feature [8, 14] .the advent of novel technologies for genetic modification of viruses offers new opportunities for biomedical research. often, these activities involve handling of viruses and their genetically modified variants in large quantities. the use of viral vectors in experimental gene therapy or as live vaccines may be also a cause for concern. indeed, such activities meet the primary requirements for cross-species mutations that facilitate the use of alternative receptors in the

it is important to identify those activities that have a finite risk of leading to new viral infections and to practice appropriate biosafety measurements. in this review risk factors associated with activities with viral vectors will be addressed from the perspective of emerging viruses that have crossed the host barrier in nature.the processes that underlie cross-species transfer through host-range expansion and establishment of viruses in new host species depend on the accumulation of genetic changes [7, 15] . these are likely to differ for various viruses and may affect virtually every aspect of the viral life cycle. this process of adaptation can occur by a variety of mechanisms including mutation, recombination and reassortment.mutations occur in the genomes of dna as well as rna viruses. in general, mutations occur slower in dna viruses than in rna viruses because of the proofreading function of many dna polymerases. this corrects mistakes made by the polymerase during replication. rna genomes are replicated by rna polymerases that lack proofreading. therefore, mutations in rna viruses can occur up to a million-fold more frequently than in dna viruses [16, 17] . as a consequence, rna viruses generally evolve more rapidly, and lead to genetic heterogeneity and the presence of so-called viral quasispecies [18] . the concept of quasispecies states that in an infected host, the virus exists as a population of genetically related but divergent variants defined by a master sequence and a complex and dynamic series of mutant sequences. while the master sequence remains the predominant sequence present within the population, the spectrum of mutants may shift in response to selective pressures. from the quasispecies population a variant may be selectively expanded [19] [20] [21] .although the major mechanism that drives adaptation is based on accumulation of point mutations, evolution of viruses also occurs through recombination. recombination occurs in both dna and rna viruses leading to the exchange of parts of genomes. this may result in the emergence of new virus variants. for recombination to take place, at least co-infection of a cell by two different virus variants is required. recombination plays an important role in evolutionary changes of dna viruses. in some cases, recombination between viruses and cellular nucleic acid can lead to the capture of cellular coding sequences [22] .reassortment is another important evolutionary mechanism in rna viruses with a segmented genome, such as influenza viruses and reoviruses. after co-infection of a cell with different strains or subtypes, genomic segments may be shuffled and rearranged in progeny virus particles resulting in the generation of new viruses with different biological properties. this offers viruses a large adaptive potential by facilitating evolutionary leaps in response to changing cellular environments without the need for gradual accumulation of favourable mutations [23] .in this section a number of examples of animal viruses that have crossed the species barrier are chosen to illustrate how they have evolved in nature through genetic changes. the examples illustrate that under the right environmental conditions host-range variants evolve that may establish themselves in the newly recruited host as new viruses causing disease. after the initial cross-transfer to the new host species, a period of further adaptation may be required. the examples also show how the evolutionary processes continue while an epidemic evolves.in the late 1970s, a new syndrome of viral enteritis and myocarditis emerged in dogs and subsequently swept rapidly across the world, killing thousands of dogs within a few years after its initial appearance. the virus was named canine parvovirus type 2 (cpv-2). phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus was remarkably similar to feline parvovirus-like viruses such as feline panleukemia virus (fpv) which infects cats, mink, and raccoons, but not dogs [24] . therefore, cpv-2 presumably emerged as a natural host-range mutant of a feline parvovirus [25, 26] .host-range properties are determined by the capsid protein for both cpv-2 and fpv. although cpv-2 is capable of infecting feline cells in culture, the virus does not replicate in cats. fpv, on the other hand, is able to replicate in dogs in a restricted fashion, i.e. in bone marrow and thymus, but not in cultured dog cells [27] . cpv-2 differs from fpv by only two nucleotide substitutions within the capsid gene resulting in two amino acid substitutions [28] . these changes are associated with the ability of cpv-2 to bind to the canine transferrin receptor with high affinity [29] . as a result, cpv-2 acquired the capacity to infect canine intestinal tissue. it is thought that subsequently this virus acquired transmissibility between dogs and further adapted to replicate more efficiently in dogs as it became pandemic.interestingly, within three years after its initial appearance in 1978, cpv-2 was replaced worldwide by an antigenically and genetically variant virus cpv-2a [25] . this indicates that cpv-2a had a strong selective advantage over cpv-2. another antigenic variant derived from cpv-2a, cpv-2b which differs by only two amino acids, arose in 1984. this implies that variants of cpv gradually arose due to further adaptation and selection in dogs, in reaction to selective, most likely immunological, pressure. the two new variants (types 2a and 2b) differ at 5 or 6 amino acid from cpv-2 isolates [30] . at present, the two variants are still endemic in the canine population. these two variant viruses have an expanded host range compared to the original cpv-2 since they replicate in cats in both experimental settings and in the wild although with no or relatively low pathogenicity [31, 32] . remarkably, the prevalence of cpv-2a and cpv-2b and new antigenic variants (cpv-2c) has now been demonstrated in a wide range of feline populations worldwide (reviewed in [33] ).the emergence of cpv-2 serves as an example of rapid global distribution and establishment of host-range mutants in an immunologically naï ve new host. whereas cpv-2 most likely arose as a natural host-range mutant derived from cats, some other scenarios on its emergence have been suggested [34] . it was suggested that cpv-2 may have emerged after cross-transfer from a yet unidentified animal host to dogs, or cpv-2 may have arisen under selective growth conditions during fpv livevirus vaccine production in canine cells and subsequently spread via vaccination. the high titers of the virus shed in faeces and its resistance to inactivation may explain its initial rapid dissemination, also into countries with strict quarantine regulations for dogs. human activity may have stimulated the spread through mechanical transport, presumably aided by long-distance air travel [25, 35] .the aids pandemic is now generally accepted to stem from a viral zoonosis. human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (hiv-1 and hiv-2) emerged separately around the same time in distinct geographically areas as the result of multiple zoonotic transmissions from simian immunodeficiency virus (siv)-infected non-human primates to humans [36] . based on their genomic organization and phylogenetic analyses it is clear that hiv-1 and hiv-2 fall into two different siv lineages [37] . this implicates that both viruses must have had distinct origins. both phylogenetic and epidemiologic evidence indicate that hiv-1 evolved as a consequence of sivcpz transmission from chimpanzees to humans in central africa [38, 39] . however, to date, no serological or genetic evidence of widespread prevalence of hiv-1-related strains exists in chimpanzees in the wild in africa. transmission of siv from sooty mangabeys in west africa most probably caused the emergence of hiv-2 since siv strains derived from sooty mangabeys are phylogenetically closely related to hiv-2. hiv-2 is found at a high prevalence in sooty mangabeys [40, 41] .both hiv-1 and hiv-2 show enormous genetic diversity. hiv-1 comprises three genetically distinct virus groups (m, n, and o) of which the predominant group m consists of 11 subtypes or clades of which all but two have spread throughout the world. in contrast, hiv-2 is mainly confined to the african continent and comprises seven distinct phylogenetic lineages, subtype groups a through g, which can be categorized in epidemic subtypes a and b and non-epidemic subtypes c through g [37, 42] . it has been estimated from phylogenetic and epidemiological data that initial cross-species transfers of both the m group of strains of hiv-1, and the progenitor group of subtypes of hiv-2, may have taken place around 1930 in west africa [43, 44] . hiv-1 may have initially started to spread in africa at the beginning of the 1960s [45, 46] . therefore, more than two decades of 'silent' human-tohuman transmission may have occurred in africa before aids became apparent and hiv was identified as its causative agent in the early 1980s.in the advent of the hiv epidemic early siv strains initially may have crossed the species barrier as a result of an increase of contact between humans and siv-infected simian species. apparently, activities such as hunting, handling and consumption of contaminated uncooked simian meat led to direct exposure to animal blood and body fluids [47] . the following years passaging between infected humans of partially adapted siv strains may have resulted in series of cumulative mutations and genetic changes. the large genetic differences that exist between siv and hiv indicate that the initial siv strains that crossed the species barrier must have undergone adaptation in humans in a relatively short period of time. this suggests the involvement of some modern iatrogenic event. massive vaccination programs carried out at that time using non-sterile injection needles may have provided opportunities for transmission and further adaptation of the virus to humans in africa [48, 49] .the genetic and phenotypic evolution of the hiv virus still proceeds at a high pace not only between individuals worldwide, but also within infected individuals. during the time-course of infection the extensive genetic diversity originates from the rapid viral turnover and replication errors caused by reverse transcriptase [50, 51] . in addition, among the globally pandemic hiv-1 m group, several circulating recombinant forms (crfs) exist. these crfs result from recombination events between two different strains within the same individual and now constitute 10-20% of newly characterized circulating strains [52] . this diversity allows the hiv virus to rapidly adapt under selective pressure generated by antiretroviral drugs and host immune responses. selection of hiv variants has been implicated in the use of different co-receptor molecules and selection for different cell types and tissues and body compartments such as lymph nodes and the brain during late stages of infection and manifestation of different disease patterns [53, 54] .the emergence of hiv exemplifies how multiple independent cross-species transmissions of simian viruses that are not associated with disease in their natural hosts eventually resulted in the establishment of two types of hiv in the human population. while adapting to its new host the virus underwent a myriad of molecular changes. changes in social behaviour of humans may well have offered opportunities for newly evolved hiv strains to become pandemic.pandemic influenza a is a zoonotic disease caused by cross-species transfer of influenza a viruses from animal reservoirs. the twentieth century has witnessed three influenza pandemics, spanish influenza (1918), asian influenza (1957), and hong kong influenza (1968), that killed millions of people worldwide. although influenza a viruses have been isolated from a variety of vertebrates, including pigs, horses, seals, and whales, birds serve as the main reservoir and are a potential source for new pandemic strains [55] .influenza a viruses contain eight negative-sense rna segments that code for at least ten polypeptides of which eight are structural viral proteins and two nonstructural proteins. influenza a viruses are divided into subtypes based on both serological and genetic differences between the surface proteins and their encoding genes, respectively. to date 15 hemagglutinin (ha) subtypes (h1-h15) and nine subtypes (n1-n9) of the neuraminidase (na) proteins have been identified. influenza a viruses containing all different combinations of the ha and na subtypes have been identified in aquatic birds. in humans only influenza a viruses of hemagglutinin subtypes h1 through 3 and neuramidase subtypes n1 and n2 have established permanent lineages. these viruses are considered human influenza a viruses [56] .in nature new influenza a viruses emerge via two mechanisms of antigenic variation. the first, antigenic drift, is caused by accumulation of point mutations in both the na and ha surface proteins enabling new antigenic variant viruses to evade the human immune system and emerge via selection. influenza a viruses that emerge via antigenic drift are responsible for the yearly epidemics in the human population. antigenic shift occurs when a variant influenza a virus arises that is antigenitically completely distinct from former circulating influenza a viruses. the new virus is a reassortant that is characterized by the presence of a novel hemagglutinin gene segment alone or in combination with a complete novel neuraminidase gene segment. influenza a variants that emerge through antigenic shift are potentially capable of causing novel pandemics in an immunologically naï ve human population [55] .the avirulent nature of avian influenza virus infections in ducks and waterfowl results from adequate adaptation to their hosts [55] . avian influenza viruses do not replicate efficiently in humans. similarly, human influenza a viruses do not replicate efficiently in birds [57, 58] . the trachea tissue of the pig contains receptors for both avian and human influenza a viruses. therefore, they are permissive to both human and avian viruses and thought to function as a 'mixing vessel' for reassortment of not only human and avian, but also swine influenza a viruses [59] . pigs are therefore also considered to be ecological niches important for the emergence of new influenza a viruses in humans. in pigs, newly reassorted viruses may further evolve by accumulation of additional mutations, further adapt to a mammalian host and eventually be transmitted to humans. ample data indicate that further adaptation to the human cellular environment is necessary for replication and efficient transmission in humans. adaptation has a polygenic basis and may involve multiple viral gene segments. it should be noted, however, that only in rare cases will cross-species transmission lead to permanent establishment of new lineages of influenza a viruses in humans [56, 60] .analyses of the viruses that caused the asian and hong kong pandemics revealed that these were caused by reassortants that contained a mixture of avian and human genome segments [61, 62] . genetic analysis of the 1918 spanish influenza virus initially suggested that the epidemic originated from a whole avian influenza virus that had been transmitted from infected pigs to humans [63] . however, the origin of the 1918 pandemic strain still remains an enigma since the presence of its ha molecule did not originate from any known avian strain. in addition, there was no evidence of adaptation to a mammalian host [64] . it was not until the 1997 hong kong epidemic that direct transmission of whole avian viruses to humans was observed. analysis of the virus that caused this epidemic revealed that a reassorted influenza a virus (h5n1) of entirely avian origin had crossed the species barrier, apparently without adaptation to a mammalian host. interestingly, the virus was able to replicate in humans but had not acquired human-tohuman transmissibility, preventing efficient spread and, potentially, a global epidemic (reviewed in [65] ).receptor specificity is considered to be a major determinant of the host range of influenza a viruses. the ha protein plays a pivotal role in host-cell receptor recognition and attachment. it binds sialic acid (sa) on the host cells. avian influenza a viruses preferentially bind to terminal sa which is joined by an alpha2,3-linkage to the sugar chain of the glycoprotein or glycolipid in the gut. however, human influenza a strains bind to terminal sa through an alpha2,6-bond to cells in the respiratory tract as a result of acquired mutations [66] [67] [68] . the 1997 hong kong avian h5n1 strain, however, possessed avian binding properties [69] . this indicates that receptor specificity alone is not an absolute requirement for birdto-human transmission. the host range of influenza a viruses is determined by a complex interplay of multiple factors [70] .the influenza a virus illustrates the unpredictability of virus variation as well as the virus's great potential for adaptation. regular close contact between birds, pigs and humans offers opportunities for reassortment and crossspecies transfer. hence, the live-bird markets in south-east asia are considered a risk [71] .a variety of experimental conditions are applied in the laboratory for propagation and isolation of viruses and their genetically modified derivatives. as a result, these viruses are subject to selective forces that are likely to differ from those experienced in nature. although conditions may be well defined and controlled, various selective pressures are generated in culture due to, e.g., changes of concentrations of nucleotide substrates, the addition of mutagenic substances, the use of different incubation temperatures, incubation with antibodies, or a change of host cells. these different selective forces have unpredictable influences on the virus.since cell culture conditions can have profound effects on the composition of viral populations, viral stocks consist of genetically heterogeneous populations (reviewed in [20, 72] the following examples demonstrate that upon persistent infection and passage in cell culture, cross-species transmissibility may be promoted by selection of virus variants with an altered host range. adaptation in cell culture may result in changes in receptor specificity and tropism, and leads to the emergence of host-range mutant viruses.the mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) is characterized by a narrow host-range and tissue specificity, both in vivo and in vitro. this specificity is primarily determined by the virus's surface spike (s) glycoprotein, which is responsible for attachment to specific host-cell receptors [73] . mhv virus variants with both an altered receptor specificity and a broadened host range were selected during continued passaging in murine or mixed cultures consisting of murine and non-permissive hamster cells. here mhv acquired the ability to infect human, hamster and monkey cells. mhv host-range expansion has been attributed to the presence of virus variants recognizing homologues of the normal receptor. adaptation required mutations in the surface s protein and selection of host-range mutants for the use of the alternative cellular receptor [74] [75] [76] [77] .selection of variants with a changed receptor specificity resulting from passage in cell culture has also been demonstrated for foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv). host-cell specificity of the parental virus is based on an rgd motif-dependent integrin-mediated entry pathway [78] . the rgd motif is an arginine-glycine-aspartic protein sequence within the virus capsid that recognizes and binds to some integrins on the cell surface of the host cell [79] . yet, upon multiple passages in bhk-21 cells, fmdv variants emerged that acquired the ability to infect several initially non-permissive human and animal cell lines via an alternative entry pathway. analysis of these variants revealed that adaptation of fmdv in cell culture led to an enhanced affinity for heparan sulfate as a receptor, independent of the rgd motif. interestingly, these host-range variants were able to maintain infectivity in cell culture not only independent of an rgd motif, but also without the requirement to bind to heparin sulfate [80, 81] . this implies the use of alternative receptors. selection of the fmdv host-range mutants was associated with amino acid substitutions in or near the capsid rgd motif [82] [83] [84] . recently it was demonstrated that passaging of fmdv in bhk-21 cells led to an expansion of the host-cell tropism to non-human primate and human cell lines. selection of these host-range variants was also associated with amino acid substitutions in the viral capsid proteins [85] .there is less data on mutation frequencies and adaptation of dna viruses in cell cultures compared to rna viruses. however, there are a number of illustrative examples. adaptation of sv40 and polyomavirus to different cellular environments resulted in the emergence of host-range mutants in cell cultures (reviewed in [86] ). random mutagenesis of human adenovirus followed by repeated passaging in certain cell lines allowed isolation of adenovirus host-range mutants [87, 88] . human adenovirus 2 (hadv2) mutants with altered specificity resulting from reduced binding affinity of the adenovirus penton-base protein for the integrins on the cells were selected in persistently infected cell lines [89] .more recently, upon passaging in cell culture, adaptation led to the emergence of herpesvirus host-range mutants. these viruses use alternative receptors and replicate in different cell types in the natural host, and in cells from different species that were previously nonpermissive. several glycoproteins are essential for the entry of alphaherpesviruses such as pseudorabies virus (prv), herpes simplex virus (hsv) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (bhv-1) (reviewed in [90] ). interaction between, e.g., the viral glycoprotein c (gc) and heparan sulfate mediates primary attachment. for infection, however, a secondary interaction between glycoprotein d (gd) and one of several entry receptors is required. single amino acid substitutions in the gd glycoprotein of herpes simplex 1 (hsv-1) as well as complete ablation of this glycoprotein in the swine pseudorabies virus (prv) led to a gd glycoprotein-independent entry mode using alternate receptors [91] [92] [93] : at least three classes of cell-surface proteins are now thought to be involved in alphaherpesvirus entry [94] . also, cell culture adaptation of human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), a betaherpesvirus, resulted in the selection of phenotypic variants that had lost their endothelial tropism [95] .in cell culture viruses may readily adapt by mutation, selection and competition. these processes are stochastic in nature. adaptation is therefore an unpredictable process, strongly influenced by the experimental setting, e.g. the multiplicity of infection used, the number of passages employed, and the type of selection employed. one should be aware of the potential adaptation when working with virus-infected cell cultures.recombinant dna technology, including 'reverse genetics' and the availability of complete (infectious) clones for a large number of rna and dna viruses, allows genetic modification of viral genomes and generation of recombinant [90, 90] viruses in vitro. these technologies offer the possibility to deliberately change the tropism or host range of the viruses. some of the latest technologies are discussed in the context of two important virus groups, i.e. influenza a viruses and coronaviruses.the advent of reverse genetics systems now allows the generation of recombinant infectious influenza a viruses entirely from cloned cdnas in cell culture. these systems are based on transfection of at least eight plasmids, each containing a copy of one of the eight influenza a virus genomic segments [96, 97] . the technology permits the generation of custom-made recombinant influenza a viruses (reassortants) containing specific (heterologous) gene segments of interest and offers the possibility to study their biological properties in cellular and animal model systems. in addition, reverse genetics can be used in the development of vaccine strategies.the use of reverse genetics allows the deliberate introduction of specific mutations in viral genes allowing selective evaluation of the contribution of individual genes or segments to, e.g., the virus's virulence/pathogenicity, transmissibility and host range. this approach has already been shown to be pivotal for the generation and characterization of reassortants containing heterologous influenza a segments from, e.g., highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) h5n1 strains [98] or the 1918 pandemic strain [99, 100] . in addition, this technology allowed the generation from cloned segments of the hpai h5n1 strain that caused the deadly 1997 hong kong outbreak [101] .reverse genetics systems can also be used as an alternative for the production of both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines in preparing for pandemic influenza a virus threats. conventional annual (inactivated) vaccine production is based on simultaneous infection of chicken eggs with two different influenza a strains followed by selection of the desired vaccine virus. this reassorted virus then contains the na and ha segments of the relevant circulating influenza a virus against the background of six complementary segments derived from an attenuated reference strain (e.g. a/puerto rico/8/34 h1n1), which is safe for humans [102] . to overcome the difficulties of selecting such reassortants and subsequent laborious time-consuming passaging of these viruses, plasmidbased reverse genetics can be used for fast and directed generation of vaccine strains [103] . for vaccines based on hpai viruses the use of reverse genetics has another important advantage. such highly pathogenic viruses are lethal to chicken embryos and cannot be grown in large quantities in this way. the virus's high pathogenicity is associated with the presence of basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site within the ha molecule [104] . by using recombinant dna technology this sequence can be eliminated. plasmid-based reverse genetics can then be used to generate the desired vaccine strain containing the attenuated ha molecule [105, 106] .in conclusion, plasmid-based reverse genetics enables the generation of defined reassorted influenza a viruses consisting of, e.g., human and avian viral gene segments of interest. however, it is usually not possible to predict the biological properties from the gene constellation of such variant viruses. such activities therefore pose potential risks, in particular when the gene constellation is not based on characterized isolates.recombinant dna technology has allowed the construction of infectious cdna clones of large rna viruses such as coronaviruses, including the sars-associated coronavirus (sars-cov) [107] [108] [109] . these reverse genetics systems can now be used as tools for the production of defined genetically modified coronaviruses [110] . this allows the introduction of specific mutations into the genome of coronaviruses, and, e.g., the exchange of specific viral genes between different coronaviruses to study their pathogenesis, replication strategy, and cross-species transmissibility. the possibility to engineer tissue and host tropism using these technologies makes coronaviruses potential vectors for vaccine development and possibly for gene therapy [111] [112] [113] .host-range specificity of coronaviruses is primarily determined at the virus entry level. several studies have demonstrated that sequence changes in the gene encoding the coronavirus surface spike (s) glycoprotein can lead to a change of tropism and host-range specificity [73] . this is illustrated by the generation of a chimeric coronavirus by targeted recombination, in which the ectodomain of the s glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) was replaced by the ectodomain of the s glycoprotein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv). this substitution conferred specific tropism for feline cells, while the ability to infect murine cells was lost [114] . vice versa, a reverse genetics strategy for fipv was developed conferring the ability to infect murine cells [115] . similar techniques may aid the studies on the pathogenicity of the sars-cov.the examples mentioned above indicate that the use of recombinant dna technology now provides for powerful systems to generate and modify, e.g., highly pathogenic viruses such as pandemic influenza a viruses and sars-cov.live attenuated virus vaccines are among the most successful viral vaccines known to date. traditionally, attenuation is achieved by the 'jennerian approach', i.e. serial passaging in cell culture [116] . by this method a number of useful vaccines currently in use have been generated. still, the mechanism by which the attenuated phenotype evolves is largely unknown. for instance, the nature and degree of genetic variation present at different stages of the attenuation process is usually not known. the presumed mechanism of attenuation is based on host-range restriction due to accumulation of changes in surface (glyco)proteins [117] . thus selection of variants seems inherent to the process of generating the desired level of attenuation and genetic stability to prevent reversion to the wild-type virus therefore, dependent on the passage history, diversity within the virus population is likely to represent adaptations to growth in cell culture. as a result, genetic variants with different host-range phenotypes may be present in the vaccine strain of the virus. examination of substrains of live attenuated vaccine lots based on the yellow virus 17d strain and measles virus edmonston strain demonstrate that these virus stocks indeed consist of a heterogeneous population of variants [118] [119] [120] [121] . a number of adverse consequences of the use of such virus stocks have been reported and associated with possible selective growth advantage of host-range variants in the recipient [122, 123] . therefore, caution should be taken before releasing live attenuated viral vaccines based on non-human animal viruses.significant progress has been made in approaches to genetically modify the tropism of vector viruses. such strategies have been used in the development of cancer gene therapy. initially, replication-deficient vectors were used for this purpose. however, to improve efficacy, tumor-targeted replication-competent viruses have been developed for the use of viral therapy of cancer (virotherapy) [124, 125] . here we discuss some of the developments with human adenovirus type 5 (hadv5).hadv5 has been widely used for a number of vector applications [126] . however, the use of genetically modified adenoviral vectors has some limitations [127] . their efficacy relies on the presence of its receptor, car (coxackievirus and adenovirus receptor for hadv5), on target cells. primary binding of the virus to car is mediated by the knob domain of the adenoviral fiber protein. subsequent internalization is mediated by the interaction between the rgd motif in the penton base of the virus and secondary host-cell integrin receptor molecules [128, 129] . to achieve cell-type specificity and a high efficacy in the absence of the car receptor different strategies have been developed. these include redirecting adenoviral binding to alternative cellular receptors by genetic modification of genes coding for the capsid proteins fiber, hexon and penton base [130] . this may result in either an expanded tropism or in abolishment of the adenoviral native tropism. table 2 summarizes a number of properties contributing to the relative risk for the use of vector viruses. for this purpose a numerical hazard score was assigned to each property. table 3 summarizes a number of adenoviral vectors with altered properties and their relative risks. such modified viruses are now being evaluated in a clinical setting for experimental gene therapy. table 3 illustrates that a change of cell tropism, tissue tropism, or host range of a viral vector should be considered as factors in risk assessment for activities with genetically altered vector viruses. in general, the use of replicationcompetent viral vectors poses special concerns with regard to unintended spread to new and undesired cell types, as well as horizontal transmission of the vector [131, 132] . a replication-competent vector virus with an altered tropism or host range virtually constitutes a new viral pathogen with the potential of a new disease manifestation.in nature many factors may contribute to the emergence of a new zoonotic viral disease. these factors consist of viral evolutionary processes such as mutation, natural selection and competition, host determinants, e.g., immune status and physiological factors, and environmental determinants such as ecological and climatological circumstances. as highlighted by the emergence of new viral diseases in the last two decades, the process of adaptation often involves the acquisition of an altered cell tropism or host range. against this background the intensified use of viruses and their genetically modified variants as viral gene transfer vectors for biomedical research, experimental gene therapy and for live-vector vaccines is a cause for concern. this review highlights the importance of identifying and evaluating the risks and consequences of activities that may generate host-range mutants with the capacity of cross-species transmission. the use of such viruses may lead to inadvertent introduction of vector viruses with a changed cell or tissue tropism and/or host range through an immunologically naï ve and non-adapted hosts. interactions between the virus and the cellular receptor often determine the host range of the virus and therefore constitute a species barrier [133] . minor mutations in the viral capsid or surface glycoproteins may already result in profound changes in cell tropism or host range of a virus. in this review we have therefore focused on the level of virus entry to address some implications for activities with viral vectors, and in particular with hostrange mutants. this could contribute to a rational and reasoned inventory of factors that should be considered in risk assessments of activities with viral vectors.in considering possible risks involved in handling replication-competent vector viruses in the laboratory, [134] . this implies that concepts such as host-range barrier and hostcell specificity may be rather flexible than rigid. if the host range and completion of the viral life cycle is exclusively restricted to the level of entry, forced entry may bypass important discriminatory host-cell restriction steps. this may result in distinct pathological phenotypes and new disease manifestations. therefore, precaution should be taken to avoid inadvertent release and spread of such potential harmful vector viruses. it goes without saying that live-virus vaccines are among the most effective modalities to control viral pathogens. it is evident that for such vaccines the benefit is higher than the possible adverse effects. nevertheless, the risks associated with handling vaccine viruses, viral vectors, and exotic viruses are small but finite. we are just beginning to understand the mechanisms that drive the emergence of new viruses and viral diseases in nature. there are parallels between the patterns that are seen in emerging viral diseases and certain virus modifications that are generated, either deliberately or inadvertently, when handling viruses in the laboratory. such patterns and the associated risks should be noted. the capacity of a virus to replicate and spread implies that in the risk evaluation, not only the risks to the laboratory personnel or the patient, but also the effects on the environment (including the human population) should be weighed against the evident benefits. only then can viruses maintain and extend their prominent role as widely applicable entities for clinical and veterinarian use.the need for laboratory assays that rapidly identify infectious diseases is substantiated by a number of government initiatives for their development. the epidemic outbreak surveillance (eos) program was initiated by the u.s. air force as an advanced concept technology demonstration (actd) to create a diagnostic assay that would identify 10 to 20 viruses and bacteria that are associated with upper respiratory infections (uri). the centers for disease control has also established its laboratory influenza test program to develop an improved diagnostic assay(s) that detects seasonal flu and novel influenza a viruses.as with the eos program, the cdc recognizes the importance of being able to distinguish between flu and other uri infections. a device capable of identifying this combination of bacteria and viruses must be able to overcome complexities associated with potentially highly variable genomes, which is especially relevant to influenza a subtyping. to date, there are 16 identified hemagglutinin [1] and 9 neuraminidase subtypes for influenza a. this rna virus has a negative strand, segmented genome, and can infect a broad range of animals including humans. identification of a virus subtype is typically by serological or molecular identification of the subtype of viral hemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na) genes. viruses with any combination of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes can infect aquatic birds whereas fewer subtypes have been found to infect humans. however, interspecies transmission can occur after recombination or mixing of subtypes in birds or pigs [2, 16, 65]. in addition, new human strains of virus can arise by reassortment to accomplish antigenic shift when two or more subtypes infect the same host [3, 4].identification of influenza subtypes is routinely accomplished with viral detection (cell culture) and serological techniques such as complement fixation, hemag-glutination, hemagglutination inhibition assays, and immunofluorescence methods [51–8]. traditional methods are generally effective, but involve labor-intensive protocols and highly trained personnel. because of their speed, specificity and sensitivity, genomic assays are ideal for complementing serological assays for identifying the genotype of an unknown specimen, especially in cases where antigenic tests are not specific enough to differentiate closely related groups [9–14].reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) is widely used for virus identification [15–17]. however, a positive amplification can be verified only by subsequent assays to elaborate sequence information. by overcoming this limitation, microarrays and biosensors have become valuable tools for viral discovery, detection, genotyping, and sequencing [6, 9, 10, 13, 17–26].although traditional assays for pathogen detection and typing represent the gold standard, they alone cannot meet the future needs of rapid, sensitive, specific, and simple methods. for example, although immunological methods are excellent for determining influenza subtypes, they do not give detailed genetic information or information when antigenic shifts occur. rt-pcr techniques depend on specific primers, which may fail when corresponding viral sequences mutate.microarrays offer an excellent solution as a downstream assay to pcr amplification. semiconductor-based oligonucleotide array technology can be used with fluorescent labels and traditional optical scanning devices or used as a biodetector using electrochemical techniques for analysis [27]. this platform is extremely flexible, allowing array designs to be rapidly and easily modified and synthesized, and thus permitting oligonucleotides of interest to be tested empirically. in addition, the ability to use electrochemical detection with semiconductor microchips eliminates the need for expensive optical scanning equipment [27–29]. the use of an endpoint measurement on the pcr reaction, such as with a real-time pcr system, when preparing the target sample that will be hybridized to the array can be used as a decision point to “gate” the choice of samples to be run (i.e., assays are only run if the pcr reaction is positive).two genotyping arrays have been developed: an influenza a subtyping array that contains specific probes for each of 16 hemagglutinin (ha) subtypes and 9 neuraminidase (na) subtypes and also an upper respiratory pathogen diagnostic array that can be used to detect both bacteria and viruses that produce upper respiratory clinical symptoms. these arrays can be hybridized with target generated from all 16 ha and 9 na subtypes or from upper respiratory tract pathogens by a one-tube rt-pcr amplification of virus rna or bacterial dna.the arrays were developed with nonoverlapping probes with similar annealing stabilities that were generated from sequence databases. for the influenza subtyping chip, subtype-specific probes were selected from a pool of over 23,000 ha and 15,000 na sequences and then compared to the database to ensure that each probe was unique to the respective subtype and would hybridize to the maximum number of variant sequences. subtype-specific probes were also subgrouped to give a finer detail for follow-up analysis, such as cluster analysis and sequence reconstruction. the probes for the upper respiratory arrays were developed in a similar manner and then cross-checked against databases to minimize the possibility of cross-hybridization of target and background from host genomic dna.the arrays were validated by hybridizing target (see fig. 6.1) that was generated from rna or dna from all ha and na subtypes on the influenza chip and all viruses and bacteria on the upper respiratory chip, which includes influenza a and b, parainfluenza, adenovirus 4, respiratory syncitial virus, coronavirus, streptococcus pyogenes, bordetella pertussis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and mycoplasma pneumonia (see fig. 6.2a,b). the target sample preparation system used with these arrays is similar to standard rt-pcr-based methods, except that it uses a very redundant/ consensus priming system that maximizes the chance that novel strains of influenza will amplify, and thus, minimize false negative results.    primers and probes for bacteria were developed from conserved genes and then compared to genomes of related organisms. the arrays contain multiple probes that correspond to key distinguishing elements of each organism or subtype. the combination of assay speed (approximately 1 hour hybridization), array sectoring which would allow multiple assays on one array, the potential to strip and reuse the chip up to five times (for conventional hybridizations), and the adaptability to inexpensive electrochemical scanning devices make these arrays a superb adjunct to real-time pcr by supporting multiplex assays and analyses in a single pcr tube.rapid identification of upper respiratory pathogens followed by ha and na subtyping of influenza a viruses, will significantly decrease the time and cost for the identification of potential lethal virus and bacterial strains and lead to better treatment and management of infections. microarray and biosensor technologies show great promise for virus detection and genotyping and are needed for rapid vaccine development, environmental screening, and the detection of bioterrorism agents [14, 15, 20, 30, 31].targets were labeled by biotin incorporation during rt-pcr. briefly, 25 μl reaction mixes included 12.5 μl of reaction buffer (invitrogen; superscript iii one-step rt-pcr kit with platinum taq), 2 μl of 5 mm mgso4, 0.7 μl of 0.4 mm biotin-14-dctp (invitrogen), 2 μl primer pool (idt, coralville, ia), 0.5 μl enzyme mix, 2 μl rna or dna sample (diluted in a solution containing 40.0 μg yeast trna (invitrogen), and 9.6 μg bsa (neb) per 1.0 ml of dh2o), and 4.3 μl dh2o. thermal cycling parameters were: (50°c − 30 min) × 1 cycle; (94°c − 4 min) − 1 cycle; (94°c − 30 s, 56°c − 45 s, 72°c − 45 s) × 40 cycles; (94°c − 30 s, 68°c − 60 s) × 30 cycles and (72°c − 5 min) × 1 cycle. primers were designed so that the forward primer tm was approximately 50°c and the reverse primer tm was approximately 65°c. influenza subtyping was accomplished with a universal forward primer with a 5′ tag and thus the rt stage of amplification was set to 42°c instead of 50°c (5′ctataggagcaaaagcagg). amplification of target was confirmed by visualizing 3.0 μl of each reaction product on 6% polyacrylamide gels (invitrogen) and staining with sybr green i (molecular probes, invitrogen).initially, microarrays were prehybridized for 30 min at 45°c in 50 μl of a solution consisting of 5 ml of 2 × hybridization solution (see below), 1 ml of 50 × denhardt's solution (sigma), and 0.5 ml of 1% sds (sigma). for hybridization (see fig. 6.1), pcr reactions from primer pools were combined and mixed 1:1 with 2 × hybridization buffer, which consisted of 6 ml of 20 × sspe (ambion, austin, tx), 0.1 ml of 10% tween 20 (sigma), 0.56 ml of 0.5 m edta (ambion), 0.5 ml of 1% sds (sigma), and 3.84 ml of dh2o (ambion). microarray hybridization chambers were filled (50 μl volume) and sealed with tape. the arrays were incubated for 1 h at 45°c with rotation in a hybridization oven (fisher scientific, pittsburgh, pa) and washed for 5 min at 45°c with 3x sspe with 0.05% tween 20; twice with 2 × pbs with 0.1% tween 20 (pbst); and then blocked for 5 min with 5 × pbs/casein (biofx laboratories, owing mills, md).for labeling, microarrays were incubated for 30 min with extravidin peroxidase (sigma) diluted 1:1000 in bsa peroxidase stabilizer (biofx). arrays were washed twice with 2 × pbst, and twice with ph4 conductivity buffer substrate (biofx). tmb conductivity 1 component hrp microwell substrate (biofx) was added to the array, and it was scanned immediately with an electrasense® microarray reader (combimatrix corp.). this instrument measures μa at each of 12,544 electrodes on the array in 25 s and outputs data in picoamps to a simple text file that can be used to create a pseudoimage or can be transferred to and graphed with an excel macro.after hybridization to microarrays and data extraction by ecd, graphs of mean subtype intensity values can be used to predict the correct pathogen genotype or subtype. this information can next be broken down into subtype-subgroups. this grouped data can then be used to cluster samples into like groups with alignment software. this software treats each hybridization as an ordered list of intensities, where the value at each position corresponds to the intensity of a unique probe. a distance metric, such as correlation, allows for the determination of the difference between any two hybridization vectors. next a similarity matrix is created containing the distances between all the hybridizations that are being compared. this similarity matrix can then be used with several clustering programs, such as the bioedit sequence alignment editor, as diagrammed in fig. 6.3.  sequence can also be reconstructed with array probe signal intensity data and then aligned with the most similar sequence in genbank (fig. 6.4). briefly, sequence reconstruction software can take all the existing sequences in the database, align them against the chip probe sequences, and then create a probe profile for each sequence. for each hybridization that is analyzed, data are passed through these probe profiles, and the probe profiles with the highest scores are chosen. next, sequence reconstruction proceeds within the small database containing the winning sequences. by limiting the dataset, resulting data have a lower background.  the oligonucleotide probes synthesized on the resequencing microarray chip were 5′ phosphorylated with t4 polynucleotide kinase (pnk, new england biolabs, beverly, ma) for 30 min at 37°c. the array was then preblocked for 15 min at 45°c with 6 × sspe containing 0.05% tween-20 (sspet), 2.0 mm edta, 5 × denhardt's solution, and 0.05% sds. single-stranded target, with an antisense t7 tag added with the forward primer (5′ taatacgactcactataggag caaaagcagg) during pcr as shown in fig. 6.5 (see section 6.1 for details), was heated to 95°c for 10 min, placed on ice and t4 ligase buffer added to 1 × concentration. a 5′ biotin-labeled t7 oligonucleotide (integrated dna technologies, inc., coralville, ia) was added to a concentration of 1 μm to provide signal for detection and primer for extension. this solution was added to the chip array hybridization chamber and incubated at 45°c for 1 h.after washing the array with 2 × pbs-0.5% tween 20, 2 × pbs and 1 × e. coli ligase buffer, a mixture consisting of 1 × e. coli ligase buffer, 0.2 mm dntp, 20 units each of amplitaq dna polymerase, stoffel fragment (applied biosystems, foster city, ca), and e. coli ligase were added to the array and incubated at 37°c for 30 min. the array was washed twice for 2 min each with 0.1 n naoh at room temperature, blocked and labeled as described in section 6.1, and then scanned with electrasense (combimatrix corp., mukilteo, wa).cpg methylation is accomplished by sonicating 2 ug of genomic dna to product fragments of approximately 500 to 1000 bp. genomic dna is diluted to 0.2 ug/ul and sonicated at a power setting of 3 for 10 s. sonicated dna is then purified with a qiagen nucleotide removal column. the dna is then denatured by the addition of 1/9 vol of freshly prepared 3 m sodium hydroxide and incubation for 15 min at 37°c. a 6.24 m urea/2 m sodium metabisulphite (4 m bisulphite) solution is made by dissolving 7.5 g of urea in 10 ml of sterile distilled water, adding 7.6 g of sodium metabisulphite (8.5 g sodium bisulphate), adjusting the ph to 5 with 10 m sodium hydroxide and adding sterile water to a final volume of 20 ml. the urea/ bisulphite solution and 10 mm hydroquinone are then added to the denatured dna to final concentrations of 5.36 m, 3.44 m, and 0.5 mm, respectively.the reaction is performed in a 0.5 ml pcr tube overlaid with 100 μl of mineral oil and cycled 20 times at 55°c for 15 min followed by denaturation at 95°c for 30 s [63]. the bisulphite-treated dna is desalted with a 3 m column: add 9 parts nen a (0.1 m tris 7.7, 1 mm edta, and 10 mm tea), load onto a 3 m empore column and centrifuge into a 15 ml tube and then wash by centrifugation with 10 parts nen a. repeat centrifugation until dry. elute in 500 ul nen b (50% meoh/dh2o) and dry in a lyophilizer. resuspend pellet in 90 ul dh2o and add fresh 3 m naoh to a concentration of 0.3 m (1:10) and incubate at 37°c for 15 min. precipitate by adding nh4oac, ph 7, to the 3 m column-purified material (3 m final) and precipitate with etoh. dry with a lyophilizer, resuspend in 100 ul te buffer, and store at −20°c until analyzed. pcr conditions to produce single-stranded target from methylated dna and wild-type dna are described in section 6.3 as for resequencing arrays.between november 1, 2002 and july 31, 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) virus infected 8,096 people and proved fatal to 774 worldwide. 1 the avian influenza (ai) virus subtype h5n1 alone infected 152 people worldwide between 2003 and january 2006, and 83 died of the disease. 2 luckily, none of the outbreaks of sars and ai infections at the beginning of the new millennium brought about the worst-case scenario. alarmingly, influenza experts seem to agree that another pandemic may be imminent (webby and webster 2003) and, as of this writing, a fearful ai h5n1 virus continues to spread in part of asia and europe.a microarray or a dna chip is a small glass or silica surface bearing dna probes. probes are single stranded reverse transcribed mrnas, each located at a specific spot of the chip for hybridization with its watson-crick complementary sequence in a target to form the double helix (e.g., schena 1999; stears et al. 2003) . microarrays currently use two forms of probes, namely, oligonucleotide (shortly, oligo) and cdna, and have prevalently been used in the analysis of gene expression levels, which measures the amount of gene expression in a cell by observing hybridization of mrna to different probes, each targeting a specific gene. with the ability to identify a specific target in a biological sample, microarrays are also well suited for detecting biological agents for genetic and chronic disease (e.g., eom et al. 2004; heller et al. 1997; lee and lee 2003; liu et al. 2003) . furthermore, as viral pathogens can be detected at the molecular and genomic level much before the onset of physical symptoms in a patient, the microarray technology can be used for an early detection of patients infected with viral pathogens (e.g., sengupta et al. 2003; vernet 2002; wang et al. 2002; zhou et al. 2005) .the success of microarrays depends on the quality of probes that are tethered on the chip. having an optimized set of probes is beneficial for two obvious reasons. one, the background hybridization is minimized; hence true gene expression levels can be more accurately determined (e.g., li and stormo 2001) . the other, as the number of oligos needed per gene is minimized, the cost of each microarray is minimized or the number of genes on each chip is increased, yielding oligo fingerprinting a much faster and more cost-efficient technique (e.g., borneman et al. 2001; li and stormo 2001) . short probes consisting of 15-25 nucleotides (nt) are used in genotyping applications (e.g., stears et al. 2003) . having short optimal probes means a high genotyping accuracy in terms of both sensitivity and specificity (e.g., li and stormo 2001; sengupta et al. 2003) , hence can play a key role in genotyping applications. for example, in a pandemic, an effective method for selecting short optimal probes may be used in the mass production of a cost-efficient device for screening for the disease in suspected or susceptible hosts. reverse genetics would be the most rapid means by which to produce an antigenically matched vaccine in a pandemic (webby and webster 2003) . an effective probe selection methodology can identify conserved regions of a viral family and hence may prove useful in the preparation of a vaccine via reverse genetics. furthermore, the methodology can promote the availability of affordable home testing kits for accurate and confidential diagnosis of genetic and infectious disease and allow advanced and adequate medical treatment planning for patients.a well-studied problem in machine learning and data mining deals with the discovery of a classification rule for different types of data. the probe design, say, for genotyping applications, can be roughly stated as selecting oligo probes for detecting a specific disease-agent in genomic sequences, hence falls into the realm of classical classification. thus far, this interesting problem at the intersection of molecular biology and optimization has received relatively little attention from the optimization community, and systematic oligo design methods proposed so far are based on a simple greedy procedure (herwig et al. 2000) , the set covering-based classification methodology (borneman et al. 2001) , support vector machines (lee and lee 2003) , an evolutionary algorithm (eom et al. 2004; lee et al. 2004) , and mixed integer and linear programming (klau et al. 2004) , briefly summarizing.from the perspective of numerical optimization, genomic data present an unprecedented challenge for supervised learning approaches for a number of reasons. to name a few, first, genomic data are long sequences over the nucleic acid alphabet = {a,c,g,t}. second, for example, the complexity of viral flora, owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes, requires a supervised learning theory to be trained on a large collection of target and non-target samples. that is, a typical training set contains a large number of large-scale samples. furthermore, a supervised learning framework usually requires a systematic pairing or differencing between each target and non-target samples during the course of training a decision rule (e.g., borneman et al. 2001; boros et al. 2000; klau et al. 2004; rahmann 2003) . owing to these and the nature of general data analysis and classification (megiddo 1988 ), a supervised learning approach to classification of genomic data without specialized features for efficiently handling large-scale data is confronted by a formidable challenge.based on a general framework of logical analysis of data (lad) from ryoo and jang (2005) , we develop in this paper a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes of length l nt, where l ∈ [6, 10]. to list some advantages of selecting oligo probes by the proposed method, first, the method selects probes via sequential solution of a small number of compact set covering (sc) instances, which offers a great advantage from computational point of view. to be more specific, consider classification of two types of data and suppose that a training set is comprised of m + target and m − non-target sequences. the size of the sc training instances solved by the proposed method is minimum of m + and m − orders of magnitude smaller than optimization learning models used in borneman et al. (2001) and klau et al. (2004) , for instance. second, the method uses the sequence information only and selects probes via optimization based on principles of probability and statistics. that is, the probability of an l-mer (oligo of length l) appearing in a single sequence by chance is (0.25) l . unless statistically significant, an l−mer appearing in multiple samples of one type and none or only a few of the sequences of the other type by chance is extremely small. third, the proposed method does not rely on any extra tool, such as blastn (altschul et al. 1990 ), a local sequence alignment search tool that is commonly used for probe selection (e.g., sengupta et al. 2003; wang et al. 2002; wang and seed 2003) , or the existence of pre-selected representative probes (e.g., sengupta et al. 2003) . this makes the method truly stand-alone and free of problems that may possibly be caused by limitations associated with external factors. as mentioned earlier, the proposed probe design selects optimal probes via sequential solution of sc instances. although sc is n p-complete (garey and johnson 1979) , its wide practical applications have invited an array of efficient (meta-)heuristic solution procedures to be developed. therefore, last, the proposed method is readily implementable for efficient selection of oligo probes. this paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2, we specialize a lad framework from ryoo and jang (2005) for efficiently analyzing genomic sequences and develop an effective method for selecting short oligo probes. in sect. 3, we test the proposed probe design algorithm in various in silico genotyping experiments using viral genomic sequences and report superb experimental results. to summarize, in all monospecific and polyspecific genotyping experiments on classification of viral pathogens using genomic sequences obtained from the national center of biotechnology information website, the proposed probe design method selected a small number of probes of length 7 or 8 nt that perfectly classified all unseen testing sequences. classifying the "noisy" human papillomavirus (hpv) sequences from the los alamos laboratory by high and low risk types, the proposed probe design method selected optimal probes in a few cpu seconds that classified the testing sequences with 90.6% accuracy. for comparison, eom et al. (2004) and park et al. (2003) experimented with the same hpv dataset and reported the classification accuracy of 85.6 and 81.1%, respectively. these in silico results demonstrate efficacy and efficiency of the proposed oligo design method and further illustrate the usefulness and potential of a well-designed optimization-based probe design method in the forthcoming era of biotechnology. finally, sect. 4 concludes the paper with a few remarks.before proceeding, we refer interested readers to schena (1999) , stears et al. (2003) and vernet (2002) for background in microarray analysis and its usage in the diagnosis of infectious disease. furthermore, as classification of more than two types of data can be accomplished by sequential classification of two types of data (see, for example, cortes and vapnik 1995; ullman 1973; vapnik 1998 and sect. 3), we present the material below in the context of the classification of + and − types of data for convenience and without loss of generality.the backbone of the proposed procedure is lad. lad is a relatively new supervised learning methodology that is based on boolean logic, combinatorics and optimization. a typical implementation of lad analyzes data on hand via four sequential stages of data binarization, support feature selection, pattern generation and classification rule formation. as a boolean logic-based, lad first converts all non-binary data into equivalent binary observations. a + (−) "pattern" in lad is defined as a conjunction of one or more binary attributes or their negations that distinguishes one or more + (−) type observations from all − (+) observations. the number of attributes used in a pattern is called the "degree" of the pattern. as seen from the definition, patterns hold the structural information hidden in data. after patterns are generated, they are aggregated into a partially defined boolean discriminant function/rule to generalize the discovered knowledge to classify new observations.referring readers to boros et al. (2000) , hammer (1986) and ryoo and jang (2005) for more background in lad, we design a lad-based method below for efficiently handling and analyzing large-scale genomic data and selecting optimal oligo probes for genotyping applications.let there be m + and m − sample observations of type + (target) and − (non-target), respectively. for • ∈ {+, −}, let us use• to denote the complementary element of • with respect to the set {+, −}. let s • denote the index set of m • sample sequences for • ∈ {+, −}.a dna sequence is a sequence of nucleic acids a, c, g and t, and the training sequences need to be converted into boolean sequences of 0 and 1 before lad can be applied. toward this end, we first choose an integer value for l, usually l ∈ [6, 10] (see sect. 3), generate all 4 l possible l-mers over the four nucleic acid letters and then number them consecutively from 1 to 4 l by a mapping scheme. next, each l-mer is selected in turn and every training sample is fingerprinted with the oligo for its presence or absence. that is, with oligo j, we scan each sequence p i , i ∈ s + ∪ s − , from the beginning of the sequence and shifting to the right by a base and stampafter this, the oligos that appear in all or none of the training sequences can be deleted from further consideration. we re-number the surviving l-mers consecutively from 1 to n and replace the original training sequences described in the nucleic acid alphabets by their boolean representations. let n = {1, . . . , n}.the data are now described by n attributes a j ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ n . for observation p i , i ∈ s • , • ∈ {+, −}, let p i j denote the binary value the j-th attribute takes in this observation. denote by l j the literal of binary attribute a j . then, l j = a j (l j = a j ) instructs to take (negate) the value of a j in all sequences. a term t is a conjunction of literals. given a term t, let n t ⊆ n denote the index of literals included in the term. then, we have t = j∈n t l j . a • pattern is a term that satisfies t ( p i ) := l j =a j , j∈n t p i j l j =ā j , j∈n tp i j = 1 for at least one p i , i ∈ s • , and t ( p k ) = 0 for all p k , k ∈ s•. note here that n t of a • pattern identifies probes that collectively distinguish one or more • sequences from the sequences of the other type.to aid in presentation, let us temporarily introduce n additional features a n+ j , j ∈ n , and use a n+ j to negate a j . let n = {1, . . . , 2n} and let us introduce a binary decision variable x j for a j , j ∈ n , to determine whether to include l j in a pattern. ryoo and jang (2005) formulated a compact mixed integer and linear programming (milp) model below with respect to a reference sample p i , i ∈ s • , • ∈ {+, −}:proof first, via the first constraint of (milp-2.i • ) and the definition of j i , we trivially havefor the reference observation p i , i ∈ s • . next, the second set of hard constraints yields that at least one of p l j = 0 for j ∈ n t for each p l , l ∈ s•. this givesfor all p l , l ∈ s•, and completes the proof.lemma 1 shows that any feasible solution of (milp-2.i • ) can be used to form a • pattern. now, note that if y l = 0 for l ∈ s • \ {i} in the solution, then the • pattern p formed also distinguishes p l from the• observations. therefore, with the objective of minimizing the sum of y l 's, the milp model can be understood as a way to generate a • pattern that distinguishes (more or less) a maximum number of • observations from the• observations. as easily seen, the number of 1's in the (optimal) solution determines the degree of the pattern generated.as demonstrated in ryoo and jang (2005) , this model efficiently generates patterns of all degree with equal ease, provided that the number of training samples used is moderate and that n is not a big number. genomic data are large-scale in nature, however. furthermore, owing to constantly evolving viral serotypes, the complexity of viral flora is high and this requires large numbers of target and non-target viral samples to be used for selecting optimal genotyping probes. adding to these the difficulties associated with numerical solution of milp in general, we see that (milp-2.i • ) presents no practical way of selecting genotyping probes.with the need to develop a more efficient pattern generation scheme, we select a reference sequence p i , i ∈ s • , • ∈ {+, −}, and setfor k ∈ s• and j ∈ n . next, we setfor l ∈ s • and j ∈ n . now, consider the set covering modelwhere c j ( j ∈ n ) are positive real numbers (refer to remark 4).theorem 1 let (x, y) denote a feasible solution of (sc • i ). then,forms a • lad pattern.proof to show the result, we need to show that the conjunction of literals formed via (2) distinguishes at least one • observation from all• observations. toward the end, recall that p ik = 1(0) indicates the presence (absence) and the absence (presence) of probe k in the reference sequence selected p i , i ∈ s • , and in p k , k ∈ s•, respectively. with the cover (x, y) of (sc • i ) on hand, let us subdivide the index set n t = { j ∈ n :observe now that= 1 implies that exactly one of p i j and p k j equals 1 for p i and p k , k ∈ s•. the cover (x, y) of (sc • i ) by definition satisfies all constraints of (sc • i ), and the hard constraints of the problem in the first set of cover inequalities require that at least one x l in the cover is set to 1 among l ∈ n with a (i,k) l = 1 for all k ∈ s•. this in turn implies that at least one p kl for l ∈ n 1 t or p il for l ∈ n 0 t equals 0 for all p k , k ∈ s• and yieldsnote that p generated on the solution (x, y) of (sc • i ) via (2) also satisfies p( p l ) = 1 for all l ∈ s • \ {i} with y l = 0. the following result is immediate.is also formulated in reference to p i for some i ∈ s • and finds a cover that distinguishes most • observations from the• observations. therefore, although not identical, (sc • i ) can be seen as an sc version of (milp-2.i • ). although smaller than the milp model by only one constraint and one integer variable, (sc • i ) has a much simpler structure and is defined only in terms of 0-1 variables. in addition, owing to having a wide range of practical applications, sc has invited the development of an array of efficient (meta-)heuristic solution procedures (e.g. caprara et al. 1999 and references therein) and any of these can be used for solving (sc • i ) (refer to remark 1). from the computational point of view, therefore, (sc • i ) is much preferred over its milp counterpart.note that (sc • i ) is defined by m + + m − − 1 cover inequalities and n + m • − 1 binary variables. also, recall that n is large for genomic sequences and the analysis of viral sequences requires large numbers of target and non-target sequences, that is, m + and m − are also large numbers. to develop a more compact sc-based probe selection model, we select a reference sequence p i , i ∈ s • , • ∈ {+, −}, and set the values of a (i,k) j for k ∈ s• and j ∈ n via (1). consider the following sc modelwhere c j 's are positive reals (again, refer to remark 4).theorem 2 let x denote a feasible solution of (sc-pg • i ). then, p generated on x via (2) forms a • lad pattern.proof same as the proof for theorem 1.we immediately have the following result that can be used for efficiently identifying the • observations that are also distinguished from the• observations by the pattern generated on the solution of (sc-pg • i ). lemma 3 with a feasible solution x of (sc-pg • i ), generate a • pattern p via (2). then, p distinguishes every • sequence p l , l ∈ s • , with p lk = p ik for all k ∈ n t from the• observations, where n t = { j ∈ n : x j = 1}.note that (sc-pg • i ) can be considered as a relaxation of (sc • i ): to see this, project (sc • i ) onto the space of x. generally speaking, therefore, a feasible solution of (sc • i ) has more x j 's set to 1 in it than in a feasible solution of (sc • i ) formulated on the same data, hence tends to generate a higher degree pattern that generally explains a difference between the target and non-target sequences. as more • observations are distinguished from the• observations at a time by a solution of (sc • i ), it is formulated and solved for a less number of times for generating a set of • patterns that collectively distinguish all • observations from the• data in a dataset under analysis (refer to the oligo selection procedure detailed below). on the other hand, (sc-pg • i ) generates per solution a lower degree pattern that explains the specific difference between the reference • observation and the• sequences and, hence, is formulated and solved for a more number of times for generating a set of • patterns. overall, the two models select about the same number of probes. however, as (sc-pg • i ) is much smaller in size, hence, is more efficiently solved, and because a high specificity is desired in genotyping applications, we prefer (sc-pg • i ) for selecting genotyping oligo probes. using (sc-pg • i ), we design one simple oligo probe selection procedure below, where p • denotes the set of • patterns generated so far.the following is immediate.theorem 3 procedure sc-pg terminates finitely.a few remarks are due now.remark 1 simply put, the number of 1's in the covers generated via procedure sc-pg determines the number of probes to be used for a specific genotyping purpose. in other words, the quality of an sc solution determines the cost of genotyping applications.sc is a well-known n p-complete problem (garey and johnson 1979) . owing to having a wide range of practical applications (despite its simple structure), sc has invited an array of (meta-)heuristic solution procedures to be developed for its efficient heuristic solution (e.g., caprara et al. 1999 and references therein) and any of these can be used for solving (sc-pg • i ). in fact, the genotyping accuracy is not affected at all as long as the covers found are near-optimal and "good enough" (see results in the following section) and this was the rationale behind our developing sc-based probe selection models in this paper: recall that probe selection is a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem in nature.furthermore, the efficiency of sc heuristic solution procedures allows one to apply procedure sc-pg or the similar directly to the binarized data to generate patterns without going through the feature selection phase. this is another benefit the sc-based pattern generation offers over its milp counterparts from ryoo and jang (2005) or the standard term-enumeration-based procedure for generating patterns in the lad literature (e.g., boros et al. 2000) .i ) has all zero coefficients, the sc instance is infeasible. this case arises when the reference sequence p i , i ∈ s • , and the sequence p j , j ∈ s•, have identical 0-1 fingerprints, which is a contradiction. supervised learning methodologies, including lad, presume for the existence of a classification function that each unique sequence in the training set belongs to exactly one of the two classes. when this holds, contradiction-free 0-1 clones of the original data can always be obtained by using oligos of longer length for data binarization.remark 3 if desired, the hybridization affinity of probes can be ensured in a number of ways, including the following. first, during data binarization, one can remove from further consideration each l-mer with the gc content less than a prescribed level or with the melting temperature calculated via, for example, the formula found in wang and seed (2003) that falls outside a certain prescribed range from the median melting temperature of all l-mers generated. next, the proposed lad-based method can be applied to select an optimal set of probes on the surviving l-mers that are "compatible" in terms of their hybridization behavior.i ) is a general-purpose model and can be specialized to select a minimal set of optimal oligo probes by any quantifiable probe selection criterion. for example, one may use the longest common factors from rahmann (2003) or the ovl scores from herwig et al. (2000) for c j values in (sg-pg • i ) to select probes by the (dis-)similarity preference. one may use, for example, the shannon entropy scores from herwig et al. (2000) for c j 's and incorporate the complexity of oligos in probe selection.denote by p + 1 , . . . , p + n + and p − 1 , . . . , p − n − the positive and negative patterns, respectively, generated via procedure sc-pg. in classifying unseen + (target) and − (non-target) sequences, we use three decision rules. first, in polyspecific genotyping applications (see, for example, experiment 4 in sect. 3.2), we form the standard lad classification rule (boros et al. 2000 )where ω • i denotes the number of • training sequences covered by p • i and assign class + (−) to new sequence p if ( p) > 0 ( ( p) < 0). we fail to classify sequence p if ( p) = 0. for the monospecific genotyping, we use a strict classification rule. specifically, for classification of two viral (sub-)types (see, for example, experiment 1 in sect. 3.2), we form a decision rule byand assign p to class • if • ( p) > 0 while • ( p) = 0. when • ( p) > 0 and • ( p) > 0 or when • ( p) = 0 and • ( p) = 0, we fail in classifying the sequence. for the monospecific classification of more than two viral (sub-)types k = 1, . . . , m (see, for example, experiment 7 in sect. 3.2), we use the decision rulewhere p k 1 , . . . , p k n k are the probe(s) selected to for virus (sub-)type k, and assign p to class k if k ( p) > 0 while i ( p) = 0 for all i = 1, . . . , m, i = k. when ( p) > 0 for more than two virus types or k = 0 for all k, then we fail to assign a class to sequence p.in this section, we extensively test the proposed probe design for classification of viral disease-agents in in silico setting. to make these experiments as "realistic" as possible, we design each of these experiments based on information from the literature and the official website of the world health organization (who) and use viral genomic sequences obtained from the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi) and human papillomavirus (hpv) sequences from the los alamos national laboratory. to be more specific about the data used, we obtained the hpv data from the los alamos national laboratory site for illustrative and comparative purposes. these data correspond to the 72 high and low risk hpv sequences that are used in eom et al. (2004) and park et al. (2003) . although some of these manually classified virus sequences contain classification errors (eom et al. 2004 ), we used the data with table 1 , we provide the number and the length (the minimum, average ± 1 standard deviation and maximum length) of each type of the genomic data used in our experiments. in analyzing data in an experiment, we first decided on a length of oligos to use by calculating the smallest integer value l such that 4 l became larger than or equal to the average of the lengths of target and non-target sequences of the experiment. then, 4 l candidate oligos were generated to fingerprint and binarize the data. if the length of oligos turned out to be not long enough during the pattern generation stage (see remark 2), the data binarization stage was repeated with the value of l incremented by 1 and this process was repeated until the binary representations of the data became contradiction free. next, procedure sc-pg was applied to generate patterns, hence, probes. in applying procedure sc-pg in these in silico experiments, we did not consider any oligo picking criterion that is non-theoretical in nature (refer to remark 4) and selected a minimal set of oligo probes with using c j = 1 for all j ∈ n . for solving the unicost (sc-pg • i )'s generated, we used for ease of implementation the textbook heuristic procedure (e.g., nemhauser and wolsey 1988 ) that selects one variable at a time by the rulewhere i j denotes the index of rows k with a (i,k) j = 1 and m u denotes the set of rows that are not yet covered by the partial cover x on hand.in each of the experiments in this section, in order to fairly assess the classification capabilities of oligo probes selected by the proposed probe design procedure, we 1. randomly selected 90% of the target and of the non-target data to form a training set of sequences; 2. binarized the training data; 3. selected optimal oligo probes on the training data via procedure sc-pg; 4. formed a classification rule by one of (3), (4) and (5) with the selected oligo probes; 5. used the classification rule to (sub-)type each of the reserved testing sequences, consisting of the remaining 10% of the target and the non-target sequences; and 6. repeated steps above 20 times to obtain the average testing performance and other relevant information of the experiment.the computational platform used for experiments was an intel 2.66ghz pentium linux pc with 512mb of memory.infection with hpv is the main cause of cervical cancer, the second most common cancer in women worldwide (bosch et al. 2002; muñoz et al. 2003) . there are more than 80 identified types of hpv and the genital hpv types are subdivided into high and low risk types: low risk hpv types are responsible for most common sexually transmitted viral infections while high risk hpv types are a crucial etiological factor for the development of cervical cancer (e.g., mcfadden and schumann 2001) .we applied the proposed probe design method on the 72 hpv sequences downloaded from the los alamos national laboratory with their classification found in table 3 of park et al. (2003) . the selected probes were used to form a decision rule by (3) and tested for their classification capability.results from this polyspecific probe selection experiment are provided in table 2 . in this and the other tables in this section, the target (+) and the non-target (−) virus types of the experiments are specified in the first column. then, the tables provide two bits of information on the candidate oligos, namely, the length l and the average and the standard deviation of the number of features generated and used in the 20 runs of each experiment for data binarization and for pattern generation: recall that we skip the feature selection stage of lad (see remark 1). provided next in the tables is the information on the number of probes selected in the format "the average ± 1 standard deviation" and information on the lad patterns generated. finally, the testing performance of the probes selected is provided in the format "the average ± 1 standard deviation" of the percentage of the correct classifications of the unseen sequences. briefly summarizing, the proposed probe design method selected probes on the hpv data in a few cpu seconds that tested 90.6% accurate in classifying unseen hpv samples. for comparison, the same hpv dataset was used in eom et al. (2004) and park et al. (2003) for the classification of hpv by high and low risk types. in brief, the probe design methods of eom et al. (2004) and park et al. (2003) required several cpu hours of computation and selected probes that obtained 85.6 and 81.1% correct classification rates, respectively.before moving on, we note that the sequences belonging to the target and the nontarget groups in this experiment all have different hpv subtypes (see table 3 in park et al. 2003) . the combination of all target and non-target sequences being different from one another and the presence of noise in the data (the classification errors) gave rise to selecting a relatively large number of polyspecific probes in this experiment.the proposed probe design method was extensively tested on genomic viral sequences from ncbi for selecting monospecific and polyspecific probes for screening for sars and ai in a number of different binary and multicategory experimental setting and performed superbly on all counts. we summarize the results from some of these experiments in this section.before proceeding, we briefly illustrate the benefit of probe selection via (sc-pg • i ) from the computational point of view with experiment 5 below. for the purpose, let us first recall that probe selection is a combinatorial optimization problem. therefore, for the selection of oligo probes for differentiating lethal ai virus h5 and h9 from the other ai virus h subtypes in experiment 5, a supervised learning method based on a complete pairwise differencing of the target and non-target training sequences (e.g., borneman et al. 2001; boros et al. 2000; klau et al. 2004; rahmann 2003) a in format average ± standard deviation b percentage of correct classifications of testing/unseen data would require solving one or more combinatorial optimization problems with between (148+93)×(137+660+77+65) = 226, 299 and 137×660×148×77×93×65 ≈ 6.23 × 10 12 rows (refer to table 1 above for the numbers of the target and non-target viral sequences) and with at least 39, 056 0-1 decision variables (see table 7 for the average number of l−mers generated in this experiment). for experiment 5, we note in comparison that the largest (sc-pg • i ) instance generated and solved by procedure sc-pg had max{148 + 93, 137 + 660 + 77 + 65} = 939 rows and 39, 056 columns.sars virus is phylogenetically most closely related to group 2 coronavirus (snijder et al. 2003) . 105 sars sequences and 39 coronavirus samples were used to select 1 monospecific probe for screening for sars. used in a classification rule (4), the sars probe and one probe selected for coronavirus together perfectly classified all testing sequences (see table 3 ).this experiment simulates a sars pandemic where suspected patients with sarslike symptoms are screened for the disease. we used the 105 sars virus sequences and 107 samples of other influenza virus types (the "other virus" in table 1 ) in this experiment and selected polyspecific probes. used in a classification rule (3), these probes collectively gave the perfect classification of all testing sequences (see table 4 ).ai virus h7n7 is highly pathogenic with the capacity to pass from human-to-human, and this raised concerns for a possible viral reassortment with human influenza h1n1 and h3n2 strains during a large outbreak of h7n7 infection in the netherlands in 2003 (koopmans et al. 2004; webby and webster 2003) .based on information from koopmans et al. (2004) , we replicated the classification of h7 and other influenza virus h subtypes in this experiment by using 77 h7 sequences and 1,103 other h subtype samples. polyspecific probes were selected and tested in a classification rule (3) to give the perfect classification rate (see table 5 ).h5 and h7 have an ominous capacity to pass from human to human (http://www. who.int; webby and webster 2003) . this experiment, using 225 h5 and h7 viral samples and 955 other h subtype sequences, selected polyspecific probes for detecting the two pathogenic h subtypes of the ai virus from the other influenza virus h subtypes and vice versa. a classification rule was formed by (3) for testing the selected probes, and we obtained the perfect testing result (see table 6 ).experiment 5 classification of lethal ai virus h5 and h9 and other influenza virus h subtypes.ai virus h5 and h9 subtypes cause a most fatal form of the disease (koopmans et al. 2004) , and they were separated from the other h subtypes of influenza virus in this experiment. 241 h5 and h9 target sequences and 939 other h subtype sequences were used to select polyspecific probes for detecting ai virus h5 and h9 subtypes from the rest. in a classification rule (3), the selected probes collectively classified all testing sequences correctly (see table 7 ).monospecific classification of sars, human influenza h1, human influenza h3, ai h5 and ai h7 virus.this multicategory classification experiment selects monospecific probes for distinguishing one from another a few notorious viral pathogens. we used 103 sars virus, 137 human influenza virus h1, 660 human influenza virus h3, 148 lethal ai virus h5 and 77 pathogenic ai virus h7 sequences and selected monospecific probes for each virus type in sequential binary classification of "one type against the rest." the selected probes were tested in a classification rule (5) to classify the testing sequences p by a strict decision rule of "assign class i to p only if one or more probes selected for virus type i is found in p while none of the probes selected for the other types are not" and gave the perfect classification result (see table 8 ; note that only a small number of monospecific probes were selected, as in experiment 1).monospecific classification of n1, n2 and n3 influenza virus.the statement "monospecific neuraminidase (na) subtype probes were insufficiently diverse to allow confident na subtype assignment" from sengupta et al. (2003) motivated us to design this experiment on multicategory and monospecific classification of influenza virus by n subtypes. we used the three influenza virus n subtypes with 30 or more samples in table 1 and selected monospecific probes for their classification. tested in a classification rule (5), the selected probes performed perfectly in classifying all testing sequences (see table 9 ; note again that only a small number of monospecific probes were selected and proved "needed" in this experiment, as in the other two monospecific genotyping experiments, experiments 1 and 6).the problem of probe design for hybridization-based experiments is an interesting problem lying at the intersection of molecular biology and optimization but has received relatively little attention from the or community. in this paper, we specialized a general lad framework from ryoo and jang (2005) for efficiently handling 3 ± 0 d e g r e e1 100 ± 0 n2 3.7 ± 0.5 degree 1 only n3 1 ± 0 d e g r e e1a in format average ± standard deviation b percentage of correct classifications of testing/unseen data large-scale genomic data and developed a probe design method for selecting short oligo probes for genotyping applications. extensively tested on genomic sequences obtained from the national center of biotechnology information and the los alamos national laboratory in various monospecific and polyspecific in silico experiments, the proposed probe design method was able to select a small number of oligo probes of length 7 or 8 nucleotides that performed superbly in classifying unseen testing sequences. these in silico results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed oligo design method. experimental results further illustrate a huge potential a well-designed optimization-based probe design method has in hybridization-based genotyping applications.collaborative research activities are planned to realize the in silico performance of the proposed probe design method on microarrays and in real hybridization experiments. also, we plan to investigate the possibility of exploiting frequently used oligo selection criteria (e.g., herwig et al. 2000; lee et al. 2004; li and stormo 2001; rahmann 2003) within the proposed probe design framework to further improve its effectiveness in terms of the number of probes needed.there are sixteen recognized serological subtypes of type a influenza virus hemagglutinin (h1 through h16) and 9 type a neuraminidase subtypes (n1 through n9). among the combina-torial diversity of 144 possible a/hn subtypes, relatively few subtypes have been identified as causes of human disease. four pandemic outbreaks in the last century, one catastrophic, appear to have introduced the subsequently prevalent seasonal human influenza virus subtypes a/h1n1 (spanish flu, 1918), a/h2n2 (asian flu, 1957), a/h3n2 (hong kong flu, 1968), and a/h1n1 again (swine flu, 1976; russian flu, 1977). the current year 2009 has been marked by a late season pandemic-scale emergence of a novel a/h1n1 outbreak strain, raising immediate concerns for public health as well as for pork and poultry production industries worldwide.as with the few common subtypes of human type a influenza viruses, there are similarly few subtypes of type a influenza viruses that are associated with most influenza infections of swine, horses or dogs. in distinct contrast, wildfowl species are natural hosts and a global reservoir for the majority of possible influenza a/hn subtypes. many of these variant strains appear to be associated with endemic infections, often asymptomatic in avian hosts [1] . fortunately, infectious transmission of such avian influenza virus strains between humans continues to be limited. however, history suggests that further evolution of these or other type a influenza strains could emerge as a next pandemic strain. similarly, variant type a influenza virus strains have emerged from time to time, imposing serious costs and burdens upon poultry and livestock production.because the natural history and the molecular biology of influenza viruses reflect such viral genome diversity, there is a critical need for rapid, sensitive, specific, and informative assays to detect and characterize any subtype of influenza virus. benchmark standard methods that employ propagation of virus in cell culture or in embryonating chicken eggs, with assays using panels of specific serological reagents, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)-based assays, using panels of short oligonucleotide primers and probes, are either slow and time consuming, or expensive. as prevailing strains of avian influenza continue to evolve and diverge, diagnostic assays that are based only on specific recognition of short signature sequences or peptide biomarker loci will increasingly fail, through false-positive and/or false-negative results. this will adversely impact critical decisionmaking.this report describes a re-sequencing pathogen microarray (rpm)-based assay for simultaneous detection, identification and characterization of any subtype of type a human or avian influenza virus, based on rapid, sensitive and specimen-specific determination of nucleotide sequences from viral hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and other genes.all specimens described in this report that were originally obtained from human subjects were obtained with informed (verbal) consent of study participants allowing for further research use, following institutional review board-approved research protocol nhrc.1999.0002, triservice population-based surveillance for respiratory pathogens among high-risk military personnel, capt kevin russell, mc, principal investigator. the nhrc irb approved verbal consent for this protocol because of minimal risk to volunteers. samples are collected for accredited diagnostic testing, and only used for further research in a de-identified manner with minimal demographic data (date and site of collection, age, sex), tested only for respiratory pathogens and analyzed in aggregate, and resulting data is not used for patient treatment or management. no part of this study was conducted as experimentation involving live vertebrate animals. reference strains of avian influenza viruses were propagated in laboratory cultures for analysis of viral rna.the naval health research center (nhrc) collects, analyzes, and archives throat-swab specimens from human subjects as part of respiratory infection surveillance at us basic military training facilities. research use of donated specimens is permitted under the local institutional review board's approved protocol-compliant informed consent (see acknowledgments). throat swabs are suspended in stabilizing transport media and archived frozen at 280uc. viral culture and pcr-based testing protocols are used at the nhrc diagnostic laboratory to determine the presence or absence of influenza virus, and these assays are accredited by the college of american pathologists as compliant with the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988, and the department of defense clinical laboratory improvement program of 1994.cloacal swabs and/or tracheal swabs from migratory birds (mostly waterfowl) and commercial poultry; tracheal and lung tissue samples from dead birds; human throat swabs and one human lung sample from a deceased patient were collected by naval medical research unit no. 3 (namru-3, cairo, egypt). avian influenza viruses in these samples were cultured using chicken eggs and/or madin-darby canine kidney cell cultures (mdck, american type culture collection, ccl-34). sample collection and viral culture techniques were as described [3] . total rna was extracted and purified from culture isolates, and 1:100 to 1:1000 dilutions were used for diagnostic evaluations. aliquots were forwarded from nhrc to the naval research laboratory (nrl, washington, dc) for rpm-flu assay (tessarray rpm-flu 3.1 kit (rpm-flu), tessarae, llc, potomac falls, va).the u.s. department of agriculture, agriculture research service (usda-ars) southeast poultry research laboratory (seprl, athens, ga) selected specimens from its reference strain archive for blinded analysis by rpm-flu. these samples comprised 20 representative avian influenza a/hn strains and also included 2 avian paramyxoviruses as controls. total nucleic acid extractions and purifications (magna pure, roche applied science, indianapolis, in) were performed following harvest from infected eggs at seprl. a 30 ml aliquot from the final preparation was frozen and forwarded for rpm-flu analysis.the nrl group evaluated pathogen detection and identification capabilities of the rpm-flu assay and kit components from tessarae, using control nucleic acid templates in assays in lieu of specimen total nucleic acid. figure s1 . a single total nucleic acid preparation from a single aliquot of a single specimen is simultaneously assayed for possible detection and illumination of specimen-specific gene sequences from each of the 188 independent target pathogen gene sequencing detector tiles on the array.the largest segment of the rpm-flu microarray (41,063 bp) is allocated to 40 detector tiles to represent the multiple subtypes of type a and type b ha and na genes, selected type a m genes, and conserved ns and pb2 gene sequences from avian influenza virus a/h5n1. selected specimens were thawed to retrieve aliquots for extraction and purification of total nucleic acid for multiple assays, including rpm-flu testing. each rpm-flu assay consumed about 30 ml (2%) of the originally archived specimen (about 1.5 ml). rpm-flu analysis of specimen total nucleic acid followed the manufacturer's recommendations (tessarae, llc; protocol details are provided with the rpm-flu 3.1 kit user manual and are available online at www.tessarae.com).the rpm-flu assay protocol is executed as a series of specimen and sample processing steps, listed below and indicating approximate time required for each step:1. extraction of total nucleic acid; reverse transcription to convert target rna sequences to cdna -1 hour 2. multiplexed amplification of targeted gene sequences by thermal cycling -2.5 hour 3. pooling, purification and fragmentation of amplification products -0.5 hour 4. end-labeling (biotinylation) of amplification products -0.5 hour 5. hybridization of labeled products to microarrays -4 hour to 16 hour (overnight preferred) 6. washing and staining arrays -1.5 hour 7. scanning arrays for data acquisition -0.15 hourthe abbreviated 4-hour hybridization time (5. above) reduces assay cycle time to single day, which may be helpful if same-day test results are a critical consideration. the overnight (,16 hour) hybridization time is recommended and preferred to optimize both assay sensitivity and the quality and length(s) of assaygenerated gene sequences from detected target pathogens.analysis of rpm-flu assay data now differs from earlier reported through the development of the prototype assay platform rpmv1 [4, 5] . each rpm-flu assay of a specimen generates sequence data as base calls (a, g, c, or t) across each detector tile of affymetrix customseq-formatted microarrays [6] (see affymetrix technical note, 2006, genechip customseq resequencing array base calling algorithm version 2.0: performance in homozygous and heterozygous snp detection). image data acquired from genechip instrument system scanning under genechip operating software control is translated by gseq sequence analysis software (affymetrix inc., santa clara, ca).tessarray sequence analysis (tseq) software evaluates a ''c3 score'' for each rpm-flu detector tile, as a metric of detected dna sequence quantity and quality. the c3 score is the total number of gseq-identified nucleotides that appear in runs of three or more consecutive (non-n) base calls, expressed as percentage of the length (nucleotides) of each rpm-flu detector tile sequence. this approach to definition of a detected sequence reduces background noise from spurious false-positive hybridizations of 25-base oligonucleotide probes that could lead to isolated and relatively uninformative single base calls.relaxed and stringent target pathogen detection and reporting thresholds for the rpm-flu assay have been statistically and empirically established for all of the resequencing detector tiles at c3 score .10 or c3 score $20, respectively. rpm-flu assay results from hundreds of clinical and field specimens as well as laboratory reference strains and synthetic dna templates (aggregate data not shown) have demonstrated that these detection thresholds often represent c3 scores that are more than 6 standard deviations (.6s, p,0.000003) above the mean of c3 scores from thousands of detector tiles from assays performed in the absence of positive control templates.all sequences from an rpm-flu assay that meet a detection and reporting threshold are automatically subjected to alignmentbased search of the tessarray validated reference sequence database (vrsd) (most recently validated instance 10 august 2009), using a dedicated server-based implementation of the basic local alignment search tool, blast, version 2.2.17 [7] . this enables identification of one or several most similar (and equivalently matching) sequence records for each target pathogen gene sequence that may be generated in the assay of every specimen. adjustable parameters for the blast search are set as: word size 11 (or 7 if c3 score ,30), match/mismatch penalty +1/21, gap costs as existence/extension +2/+1, low complexity region filter off, and mask options off.in order to qualify for reporting of target pathogen detection using the relaxed threshold (c3 score .10), a blast alignment and sequence similarity search using the assay-generated sequence of basecalls must return one or more most similar sequence records from the search database (as tessarae's vrsd) that are concordant with the identity of the tentatively identified target pathogen suggested by the identity of the particular resequencing detector tile. infected culture lysates were then diluted for infections of replicate shell vial cultures to determine infectious titers (performed by virapur, san diego, ca). the resulting stocks of brd10622n(h1n1) and brd10601(h3n2) were determined to contain 3.16610 7 tcid 50 /ml and 1.78610 7 tcid 50 /ml, respectively.serial ten-fold dilutions of viral stocks for rpm-flu assays were prepared using fresh cell culture media as diluent, from 10 0 (neat) to 10 23 , and then three-fold dilutions were prepared from 1:3,000 to 1:2,187,000. the routine rpm-flu protocol for total nucleic extraction and purification was performed on each of the triplicate diluted samples of the viral stocks for identity-blinded triplicate rpm-flu assays.the influenza virus subtype a/h1 gene detector tile 'ha1(h1n1)' on the rpm-flu microarray is an array of 11,808 resequencing oligonucleotide probes (25-mers), representing the nucleotides 113 through 1,588 of the a/new caledonia/20/99 (h1n1) strain hemagglutinin gene (genbank accession number ay289929). this is the actual a/h1n1 strain of influenza virus representing the viral ha1 gene product in the 2004-2005 vaccine configuration.an aliquot of flumist vaccine (2004) (2005) was subjected to rpm-flu assay, from which 1,351 specific base calls were determined across the ha1(h1n1) detector tile, resulting in c3 score = 91.5. blast analysis returned ay289929 a/new caledonia/20/99 (h1n1) as the most similar sequence record from alignment-based search across the entire genbank, with the limit (minimum) expectation value of 0.0 (or e-value = 1.0e-180). figure 2 shows the alignment of a 540-nucleotide segment of this rpm-flu assay detected sequence, below corresponding intervals of the rpm-flu detector tile sequence. this part of the rpm-flu ha1(h1n1) detector tile spans the locus of the a/h1 hemagglutinin peptide cleavage site [8] . each of the nine successive 60 bp rpm-flu assay-detected ha1 sequence segments shown in the inset was subjected to blast alignment and similarity analysis. these short query sequences (60 bp) are identical matches to corresponding hemagglutinin sequence segments of many different a/h1n1 isolates, but in each case, the list of identical sequence record(s) returned by blast includes one or more a/new caledonia/20/99 (h1n1) records. this includes those 60 bp lines with runs of up to 12 uncalled bases (n). with the exception of small gaps of uncalled bases, the detected sequence is identical to the prototype sequence of the rpm-flu ha1(h1n1) detector tile.this example of the integrity of rpm-flu assay-generated target pathogen gene sequencing for detection and identification is reinforced by results for the other specific hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix gene sequences from the same rpm-flu assay of the same aliquot of flumist vaccine. table 1 shows that the most similar sequence records returned from blast analysis of assay-generated ha1, na1, ha3, na2, m(h1n1), m(h3n2) gene sequences, as well as type b ha, na and m gene sequences, all correctly correspond to the actual influenza virus strains used to represent these components in the 2004-2005 vaccine configuration. this result is achieved even for instances (ha3, na2, b-ha, b-na and both the type a and type b m genes) where the rpm-flu detector tile sequences and actual vaccine gene sequences do not precisely match. this reflects the robust capability of the rpm-flu resequencing microarray to determine accurately the match or alternative mismatch of each target gene nucleotide relative to corresponding nucleotide of the detector sequence. these results also demonstrate the noninterference of similar assay targets for rpm-flu detection and identification of multiple target gene sequences from the same specimen.similarly specific typing, subtyping and strain identification results to those shown in table 1 tables s1,  s2 , s3 and s4). we note that results of assays using inactivated influenza virus vaccines identify detected type a matrix gene sequences are most closely (and correctly) matched by matrix gene sequence records from the a/puerto rico/8/34 (h1n1) master donor strain that is used for gene segment re-assortment to select for the inactivated vaccine strains.the results in table 1 are similar to those presented by wang et al. [9, that report's table 4 ]. that earlier work was performed using the rpmv1 prototype precursor platform of the tessarray rpm-flu 3.1. the rpmv1 allocated only 7,691 base pairs (bp) to 9 different influenza-specific detector tiles, compared with the rpm-flu assay that allocates 41,063 bp over 40 influenza virusspecific detector tiles (see figure 1 ). the prototype rpmv1 assay also employed random primers in a reverse transcription and pcr-like protocol for total rna amplification, and did not apply the c3 quantity/quality metric methodology described in this report for analysis of rpm-flu assay-detected target pathogen gene sequences. table 2 presents ha, na and m gene detector tile c3 scores from rpm-flu assays of samples representing prevalent human subtypes a/h1n1, a/h3n2, and type b influenza viruses, inactivated trivalent influenza virus vaccine, and selected a/hn subtypes of type a avian influenza viruses. c3 scores that failed to meet or exceed the rpm-flu assay detection and reporting thresholds are shown in parentheses and in smaller font size to distinguish them from c3 scores representing positive detection and identification of one or more of the rpm-flu assay-targeted influenza viruses.except for the vaccine sample, assays of each sample reported sequences from only one hemagglutinin detector tile and one neuraminidase detector tile, those corresponding precisely to the specimen's a/hn subtype or b type.the mean values of c3 scores from the positive detector tiles in table 2 the lowest positive control result from this data set was for the na gene of the nhrc-type b influenza virus-positive specimen (c3 pos = 13.7). the same assay of this specimen generated higher c3 scores for sequences from the b-ha (c3 = 31) and b-m (c3 = 34) detector tiles that exceeded the stringent detection threshold. the type b-na sequence from the assay met the relaxed detection threshold (c3 score .10), in part because blast analysis of the sequence returned nine most similar type b influenza virus na gene sequence records. this corroborated a tentative detection report (relaxed threshold) that might have been made on the basis of the na gene resequencing result alone. the specimen was collected in 2006 at u s army fort leonard wood, mo, and each of these most similar sequence records represented a na gene from various circulating type b influenza virus strains collected during the same influenza season.the rpm-flu microarray includes four influenza virus matrix gene detector tiles, representing matrix gene sequences from selected reference strains of a/h1n1(human), a/h3n2(human), a/h5n1(avian) and b(human) types and subtypes. the results in table 2 demonstrate specific discrimination and no apparent crosstalk between the three type a and the one type b matrix gene detectors. however for each of the human and avian subtypes of type a influenza viruses, it is generally the case that all three of the corresponding type a matrix gene detector tiles generate very similar and overlapping specimen-specific matrix gene sequences.we have reviewed the lists of most similar sequence records returned by blast analysis of rpm-flu assay-generated gene sequences from 12 different human (seasonal) a/h1n1 strains and 31 different human (seasonal) a/h3n2 strains.among rpm-flu assay results from the 12 a/h1n1 samples there were 478, 800, 201, 348 and 312 most similar sequence records returned from blast analysis of sequences generated from the ha1(h1n1), na1(h1n1), m(h1n1), m(h3n2), and ns(h5n1) detector tiles, respectively. without exception, each of these most similar sequence records represents an a/h1n1 strain, including the 660 sequence records found to match the rpm-flu sequences generated from the rpm-flu m(h3n2) and ns(h5n1) detector tiles. among the 31 a/h3n2 samples there were 754, 189, 1267, and 1678 most similar sequence records returned from the ha3(h3n2), na2(h3n3), m(h1n1), and m(h3n2) detector tiles, respectively, and every one of these sequence records represents an a/h3n2 strain.however, the ns (h5n1) detector tile generated 109 specimenspecific ns gene sequences from several of the a/h3n2 samples, and only 19 of the most ns gene sequence records were from a/ h3n2 strains. the other ns gene sequence records that were found by blast to be most similar to the sequences generated from assays of a/h3n2 specimens represent subtypes a/h2n2 (12), a/h1n1 (73), a/h11n9 (2), a/h6n2 (2) and a/h3n6 (1). these results suggest that circulating strains of subtype a/h3n2 harbor diverse ns gene sequences, variations that presumably arise from frequent co-infections and genome segment reassortments in the field. on the other hand, the subtype a/h1n1 specimens led to rpm-flu assay-generated ns gene sequences that are most similar to ns gene sequence records associated with subtype a/h1n1 strains. although it appears that the rpm-flu assay-generated m gene sequences may have some utility to differentiate human a/h1n1 and human a/h3n2 subtypes, the ns gene sequences do not appear to be so reliable for the purpose of inferring a/hn subtype. this consideration will appear again later in results with the subject of indirect, inferred a/hn subtyping of type a avian influenza viruses.the rpm-flu assay was implemented in a blinded analysis of several hundred clinical specimens from the respiratory infectious disease archives at nhrc. selected throat swab specimens had been collected over the period 2005-2007 from basic military trainees at several installations in the united states. the subjects were evaluated at the time of specimen collection and associated with one of three cohorts: apparently healthy and afebrile individuals; those diagnosed with febrile respiratory illness (fri); and those diagnosed with pneumonia (confirmed by chest x-ray). a group of 298 specimens were analyzed using both the rpm-flu assay and a validated benchmark rt-pcr assay for type a influenza virus described by freed et al. [10] . thirty specimens were identified as positive for type a influenza virus by both assays, and only 1 specimen was found to be negative by rpm-flu and positive by rt-pcr. the remaining 267 specimens were found to be negative for influenza virus by both assays. all of the influenza-positive specimens were from participants that had been assigned to the fri cohort. table 3 shows the calculation of high clinical sensitivity (97%) and even higher clinical specificity (100%) of rpm-flu for detection and identification of type a human influenza virus, compared with results from testing the same specimens with the benchmark rt-pcr-based assay. similarly high clinical sensitivity and high clinical specificity of rpm-flu have been demonstrated with in the same ensemble of clinical specimens with respect to other simultaneously targeted pathogens of the assay, when similarly robust rt-pcr test panels were used for benchmark testing of matched specimens (e.g. human adenoviruses of subgroups b1, b2 and e; mycoplasma pneumoniae; results not shown).the benchmark rt-pcr type a influenza virus test used to assess clinical sensitivity and specificity of the rpm-flu assay does not distinguish between the a/h1n1 and a/h3n2 subtypes. however the rpm-flu assay is capable of simultaneous and mutually exclusive identification of a detected type a influenza virus as either seasonal subtype a/h1n1 or seasonal subtype a/ h3n2. results presented in table 4 demonstrate this capability for the 30 specimens representing subtype a/h1n1 (5 specimens) or subtype a/h3n2 (25 specimens). differentiation of the two prevalent subtypes is primarily based upon identification of assaygenerated ha and na sequences as matching ha1 or ha3 and/ or na1 or na2, respectively. a secondary inference of a/hn subtype may be based on which of the m gene detectors m(h1n1) or m(h3n2) has the higher c3 score. these indications of type a human influenza subtype are completely concordant with the corresponding subtypes associated with the most similar m gene sequence records from blast analysis of the sequences generated from both the m(h1n1) and the m(h3n2) detector tiles.in the course of increasing prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant strains of a/h1n1 and amantadine-resistant strains of a/h3n2, the nhrc has implemented a new rt-pcr panel to determine the a/h1 or a/h3 subtype for specimens already shown to be type a influenza virus-positive by the earlier rt-pcr panel (david metzgar, chris myers, personal communication). they have also validated the assay by demonstrating concordance of subtyping results from new rt-pcr panel with a cell culture/ hemagglutinin immunofluorescence assay (hai). type b influenza virus-positive specimens (identified from the first tier rt-pcr typing panel) were negative controls for the second tier rt-pcrbased type a subtyping panel.twelve isolates from the 2008-2009 influenza season, six each testing positive for a/h1 or a/h3 by the rt-pcr panel (and also by culture-hai), were selected for rpm-flu analysis. all of the specimens tested definitively positive in the initial (and only necessary) rpm-flu assay as either a/h1n1 or a/h3n2, matching the results of both the rt-pcr and hai benchmark a/h1 and a/h3 assays. these results are summarized in table 5 , reinforcing the point of mutually exclusive detection and identification of specimen-specific gene sequences from the ha1 and na1 detector tiles (as a/h1n1) or from the ha3 and na2 detector tiles (as a/h3n2). the results for m gene sequences from both the m(h1n1) and the m(h3n2) detector tiles for both sets of specimens shown in table 5 again display significant crosstalk as overlapping and highly similar assay-generated sequences. in every example the two m gene sequences of an individual specimen, generated from the m(h1n1) and m(h3n2) gene detector tiles, are consistent with the a/hn subtype directly indicated the ha and na gene sequences generated in the same rpm-flu assay of the same specimen.all 30 of the influenza-positive specimens described above were also reported by the individual rpm-flu assays to be positive for at least one and up to six other viral and/or bacterial respiratory pathogens, including adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, moraxella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, pseudomonas spp., streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. there was no obvious correlation of the distributions of other co-infecting pathogens with the particular subtype of infecting influenza virus, or with particular specimen collection venue(s). there was no data on clinical presentation or outcomes to correlate with particular states of coinfection(s).we considered whether or not there may be interference with the detection and identification of specific influenza viruses in specimens that test positive in rpm-flu assays for other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. the background distribution of c3 scores for detection and identification of influenza viruses was estimated from rpm-flu assays of 14 different blank samples (water or transport media negative controls). the average c3 score of the 39 type a and type b influenza virus detector tiles to be 1.761.1 (n = 14, results not shown).another set of 25 specimens were found to be negative for influenza virus by both rpm-flu and benchmark rt-pcr tests, while the same rpm-flu assays reported the specimens to be positive with apparently high load (c3 score.75) of at least one other viral or bacterial respiratory pathogen (results not shown).simultaneous pathogen targets of the rpm-flu assay that apparently do not interfere with detection and identification of influenza viruses include adenovirus (types ad4, ad7), coronavirus at least five loci in the m2 trans-membrane peptide-encoding region of influenza virus m gene have been reported to confer some level of in vitro amantadine resistance [12, 13] . this suggested examination of the rpm assay-generated m gene sequences from these a/h3n2-positive specimens, to evaluate possible correlations with resistance of the subject isolates to amantadine. figure 3 shows alignment of m gene sequences from 18 of the 25 a/h3n2-positive specimens, together representing all three of the clades described by nelson et al [11] .the m gene sequences detected by rpm-flu assay of the 24 amantadine-resistant n-lineage or clade-a specimens all reveal -aat-as asparagine (n) codon 31 of the m2 peptide, a genotype consistent with amantadine resistance. the matrix gene sequence of the outlier clade-b specimen (nhrc_393) reveals -agt-as serine (s) codon 31 of the m2 peptide, a genotype consistent with an amantadine-sensitive phenotype. . these more recent a/h1n1 strains appear to have a resistance phenotype due to mutation at the viral na1 gene h275y locus [16] .neuraminidase gene sequences were detected and compared at this locus from rpm-flu assays of specimens from the earlier 2006-2007 season and more recent 2007-2008 season specimens provided by nhrc for analysis. as shown in the figure 4 these results do not explicitly corroborate the h275y resistance genotype, although they are consistent with diminished resequencing efficiency at sites of mismatching detector tile and specimen gene sequences. these runs of n-calls suggest two or more proximal nucleotide mismatches may be present at this na1 gene locus of the selected nhrc 2008 specimens. there were 115 [11] . twenty-four of the samples represent amantadine-resistant n-lineage or clade-a specimens, and each of these reveals -aat-as asparagine (n) codon 31 of the m2 peptide (locus outlined in red box), a genotype consistent with the amantadine resistance phenotype. the matrix gene sequence of the single outlier clade-b sample (nhrc_393) reveals -agt-as serine (s) codon 31 of the m2 peptide, a genotype consistent with the amantadine-sensitive phenotype. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008995.g003 most similar sequence records returned by blast for the three full-length rpm-flu assay-generated na1 gene sequences, and five of these sequence records indicated a second, h275yproximal mutation (at positions of asterisks on either side of the @ symbol). any such pair of proximal mismatches in a specimen gene sequence (template) could disrupt hybridization of the sets of 25-nucleotide oligomer probes used to determine basecalls by the rpm-flu re-sequencing method.future iterations of the rpm-flu microarray design could provide one or more alternative na1 gene sequence detector subtiles. such assay design iterations would enable future rpm-flu assays to deliver more explicit first-assay characterization of the oseltamivir genotype and phenotype.an isolate of subtype a/h1n1 and another of subtype a/h3n2 were selected by nhrc for single-passage propagation in mdck cell cultures, followed by infectivity titrations in replicate shell vial cultures. the resulting neat stocks of brd10622n(h1n1) and brd10601(h3n2) were determined to contain 3.16610 7 tcid 50 /ml and 1.78610 7 tcid 50 /ml, respectively.these two titered stocks were used to determine the analytical sensitivity of the rpm-flu, by blinded assays of samples extracted from triplicate three-fold serial dilutions in the range of 1:1,000 to 1:2,187,000. background c3 scores were used as thresholds for reporting detection of either a/h1n1 or a/h3n2 in these limit dilution assays (as opposed to the relaxed and stringent thresholds used for reporting results from assays of clinical or field specimens). the background detector tiles represent 25 non-a/h1n1 and non-a/h3n2 detector tiles from each individual rpm-flu assay, and a positive detection was reported if one of the target-specific detector tiles from the following lists had c3 score at least 3.29 standard deviations greater than the background mean c3 score (p,0.001). figure 5 and figure 6 illustrate the results of these endpoint dilution titrations of the titered a/h1n1 and titered a/h3n2 stocks, respectively, plotting the average highest c3 score of a/ h1n1 or a/h3n2 detector tiles for each of the triplicate assays at each dilution level. the percent positive assays (3/3, 2/3, 1/3 and/or 0/3) are also shown for the a/h1n1triplicate dilutions ( figure 5 ) and for the a/h3n2 triplicate dilutions ( figure 6 ). these unblinded dilution titration assay results were used to estimate 95% positive detection endpoints. then one of the a/ h1n1 and two of the a/h3n2 dilution tiers were expanded from three to twenty replicates, in order to demonstrate the high likelihood ($95%) of positive detection and identification at the indicated dilution of the respective neat stocks.from these results rpm-flu assay, the 95% positive endpoint dilution limits of detection (lod) be 3 tcid 50 for the a/h1n1 titered stock preparation and 6 tcid 50 for the a/ h3n2 titered stock preparation.from the total of 41 independently extracted dilution specimens of the subtype-confirmed and titered a/h1n1 stock ( figure 5 ), 37 were reported to be influenza-positive by rpm-flu assay, and all of these assays correctly reported by the rpm-flu assays as subtype a/h1n1 (100% specificity). from a total of 58 independently extracted dilution specimens of the subtypeconfirmed and titered a/h3n2 stock (figure 6 ), 44 were reported to be influenza-positive by rpm-flu assay, and all of these assays correctly reported by the rpm-flu assays as subtype a/h3n2 (100% specificity). a total of 268 specimens from the nhrc clinical specimen ensemble were found to be negative for type a influenza virus by the rpm-flu assay and 267 of these were also reported to be influenza virus-negative by benchmark rt-pcr assays for type a influenza virus, supporting the conclusion of 100% subtyping specificity for the rpm-flu test. a collection of 23 reference strain specimens, representing diverse type a avian influenza virus subtypes, were propagated in embryonated eggs by seprl, then extracted for purification of total nucleic acid as input to rpm-flu assays. table 6 presents the results for 19 of these 23 specimens reported by the rpm-flu assays to be positive for avian influenza virus. in each case the rpm-flu assay-generated ha and na gene sequences identified the particular a/hn subtype that precisely matched the unblinded identifications of each reference strain. blast/genbank analysis of these rpm-detected query sequences returned best matching sequence records with the same a/hn types as determined from the ha and na detector tile c3 scores. for 14 of these specimens, the single or multiple most similar ha and na gene sequence records included the particular reference strain actually provided by seprl for analysis. these instances are highlighted as entries with flanking asterisks in the right column of table 6 ).the rpm-flu assay of specimen usda_13 was reported negative for detection of avian influenza virus, but the same assay also reported the specimen to be positive for avian metapneumovirus. this was revealed to be a correct result after unblinding of the specimen identification as a non-influenza control type c avian metapneumovirus.three avian influenza virus-negative rpm-flu assay results were also concordant with subsequently unblinded specimen information. usda_5 was rpm-flu negative for avian influenza and later confirmed to have been from an unsuccessful inoculation of the egg culture.usda_8 was reported by rpm-flu assay to be a/h11n9, and while the initial identification from seprl was subtype a/h9n2, the original specimen apparently represented a mixed infection of h11n9 and h9n2. the ha component of the specimen was subjected to de novo gene sequencing and determined to be a/h11 strain. the rpm-detected neuraminidase sequence (868 bp, c3 = 88.7) unequivocally matched a/n9; the mean c3 score of all other neuraminidase detector tiles in the assay was 3.161.6 (n = 10). usda_16 was correctly negative by rpm-flu assay for avian influenza, but unblinding revealed this specimen to be a second negative control, containing instead avian paramyxovirus type i (newcastle disease virus). after receiving this information, another aliquot of the same nucleic acid preparation from specimen usda_16 was tested using an alternative rpm-tei assay [17] for detecting tropical and emerging infections. this assay resulted in successful detection and identification of avian paramyxovirus type 1.specimen usda_23 was received later as a substitute for the failed inoculum specimen usda_5. the rpm-flu assay of this specimen resulted in detection of sequence for neuraminidase type n4, with most similar sequence record representing an a/h8n4 strain. however, no hemagglutinin gene sequences were detected that met even the relaxed detection threshold. the

plotted against log 10 tcid 50 input per assay. open circles represent the quantal percentage of positive assays (out of three) at each dilution tier. the open and black hexagons correspond to a

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008995.g006 ha1 (h1n1-1918) , a very short detector tile, and fluaha7, but neither of these sub-threshold results triggered a positive detection report.lin et al (2009) recently reported another study of avian influenza viruses using rpm-flu assays for 24 ah5n1-positive field and clinical specimens collected by the namru-3 group from infected birds and humans [18] . supplemental table s5 summarizes results from our re-analysis of their original rpm-flu assay data (gseq fasta files), presenting c3 scores as described in this report for assay-generated sequences from the subtype-specific ha and na detector tiles, or from the rpm-flu m, ns and pb2 detector tiles (that represent conserved gene sequences of a prototype a/h5n1 strain).the rpm-flu assay-generated ha5 gene sequences of all the a/h5n1-positive specimens from namru-3 and also of the a/ h5n2 reference strain specimen from seprl (table 6 , usda_17) were consistent with an extended arginine-rich and lysine-rich motif spanning the ha5 peptide cleavage site, consistent with a viral high pathogenicity (hp) phenotype [19, 20] . blast analysis of the rpm-flu detected ha5 gene sequences from these strains returned most similar sequence records encoding a similar hp-like ha5 cleavage site motif.the hemagglutinin rpm-flu assay-generated ha5 gene sequence for the a/h5n3 reference strain (table 6 , usda_14) had a significant gap of uncalled bases at the ha cleavage site locus, compared to the hp-like ha gene detector tile sequence a/ for 14 of these specimens, the single or multiple most similar ha and na gene sequence records matching sequences from the rpm-flu assay included the particular reference strain actually provided by seprl for analysis. these instances are with asterisks flanking entries in the right column of table 6 ). other instances, without asterisks, represent assayed reference strains for which one or both ha and na gene sequences had not yet been deposited in genbank, but which were nevertheless concordant with sequences generated by the rpm-flu assay. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008995.t006viet nam/1203/2004 (h5n1). the most similar hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene sequence records returned by blast for ha and na gene sequences of usda_14 included strain a/ duck/singapore/3/1997 (h5n3), the actual reference strain submitted (blinded) for rpm-flu analysis. the encoded hemagglutinin gene cleavage site for this reference a/h5n3 strain is consistent with a low pathogenicity (lp) phenotype. these results demonstrate efficacy of rpm-flu for unequivocal diagnostic detection and identification of human and avian influenza virus subtypes, based upon direct determination of specimen-specific sequences of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. the two negative control specimens, usda_13 and usda_16, demonstrated the capability of the rpm-flu assay to identify alternative pathogens to avian influenza virus as components of a more complete differential diagnosis assay for cases of avian influenza-like illness.the results presented in table 6 demonstrated 19 of 19 reference strains of type a avian influenza viruses detected and correctly identified by corresponding a/hn subtype, based upon the specific ha and na gene sequences revealed in the assays of each specimen. the same assays also generated specimen-specific m, ns and/or pb2 gene sequences. we used these results to poll the a/hn subtype(s) of the influenza virus strains corresponding to blast-returned sequence records found to be most similar to these relatively conserved non-ha and non-na gene sequences (supporting information -table  s6, table s7, table s8 ).blast analysis of the m gene sequences from the 19 avian influenza specimens returned 79 most similar sequence records, of which 40 (51%) were associated with different a/hn subgroups than determined from the corresponding specimens' ha and na gene sequences. for five of the 19 specimens there were no most similar m gene sequences returned to match the specimen's actual a/hn subtype (table s6) .blast analysis of the ns gene sequences from the 19 avian influenza specimens returned 63 most similar sequence records, of which 41 (65%) were associated with different a/hn subgroups than determined from the corresponding specimens' ha and na gene sequences. for five of the 19 specimens there were no most similar ns gene sequences returned to match the specimen's actual a/hn subtype (table s7) .blast analysis of the pb2 gene sequences from the 19 avian influenza specimens returned 58 most similar sequence records, of which 22 (38%) were associated with different a/hn subgroups than determined from the corresponding specimens' ha and na gene sequences. nine of the 19 specimens had no most similar pb2 gene sequences from the same a/hn subtype (table s8) .these results suggest little predicate value of most type a influenza virus m, ns or pb2 sequences for determination of the a/hn subtype of the strain from which these sequences were identified.we referred earlier to the complementary set of field and clinical samples (isolates, not original specimens) of type a avian influenza viruses provided by namru-3 (cairo, egypt) and analyzed at nrl using rpm-flu [18] . as noted earlier, table s5 in supplemental information presents the c3 scores from rpm-flu assay-generated gene sequences data for these specimens.eight samples from this previously referenced set of clinical and field specimen isolates of avian influenza virus represented subtypes a/h10n7 (4), a/h7n7 (2), a/h11 (1) or a/h13 (1). in marked contrast to results from rpm-flu assay-generated ha and na gene sequences, there was poor correspondence of the actual specimen a/hn subtypes with the subtypes of sequence records returned from blast analysis of the assay-generated m, and ns gene sequences. of 30 most similar m gene sequence records only 5 were from a/hn subtypes matching the subtypes of the corresponding specimens (table s6 ). none of the 11 most similar ns gene sequence records matched the a/hn subtypes of the corresponding specimens (table s7 ). there were no pb2 gene sequences reported from assays of these eight (non-a/h5n1) specimens (table s5) .twenty-one of the remaining specimens of the set reported by lin et al [18] were of subtype a/h5n1, and the rpm-flu assay results for these specimens are also included in table s1 , as c3 scores for the sequences generated from the corresponding ha5, na1, m, ns and pb2 gene detector tiles. for these 21 a/h5n1positive specimens, the blast analyses of assay-generated m, ns and pb2 gene sequences exclusively represented subtype a/h5n1 avian influenza viruses, as 255 m gene, 146 ns gene and 310 pb2 gene sequence records.this result for a/h5n1strains is reminiscent of the results presented earlier for subtypes a/h1n1 and a/h3n2 and type b human influenza virus sequence records that are found to be most similar to rpm-flu assay-generated m, ns and pb2 gene sequences from the corresponding types and subtypes. it is interesting to consider that these results may reflect the highly biased over-representation of samples a/h5n1 sequences in the genome sequence database(s), reflecting much more of the natural diversity of non-ha and non-na gene sequences than in more sparsely sampled (but naturally far more prevalent) avian influenza virus subtypes.rapid and cost-effective microarray-based resequencing (rpm) of influenza virus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes provides sensitive detection and specific identification for types and subtypes of previously known as well as emergent strains and variants. these capabilities of the rpm platform stand out very favorably on comparisons with the most recently adopted diagnostic methodologies that are based on real-time reverse-transcription, polymerase chain reaction methods (rt-pcr). the fda-cleared cdc rrt-pcr flu panel (510(k) 080570) enables detection and discrimination of influenza viruses having ha subtype components a/h1, a/h3 and a/h5, and also type b influenza virus. however the test provides no assurance that a positive test result correctly identifies one of the inferred target subtypes a/h1n1, a/h3n2 or a/h5n1; there is no neuraminidase subtype component evaluated as part of the test. results presented in this report demonstrate that the tessarray rpm-flu detect and identifies these three targeted subtypes of interest, but also directly distinguishes each of them among the 9 different a/hn subtype categories, or from the background of 144 combinatorial variations of influenza virus a/ hn subtypes.the rpm-flu assay leverages a multiplexed rt-pcr-like strategy to rapidly (,1 hour) amplify trace quantities of specific target gene sequences so that they may be detected if actually present in a specimen. results from this report demonstrated that the 95% endpoint limits of detection (lod) for seasonal a/ california-nhrc/brd10622n/2009(h1n1) and seasonal a/ california-nhrc/brd10601n/2009(h3n2) influenza virus strains were 2.8 infectious doses (tcid 50 ) and 5.8 tcid 50 , respectively. these strains have not been serially passaged at high multiplicity in either egg or mdck cell cultures, so it is not likely that accumulations of defective viral particles would favorably bias determination of sensitivity with genome-based assays relative to infectious doses. furthermore, these two strains were not selected a priori for favorable match of viral sequences with oligonucleotide primers used for target gene sequence amplification. the observed rpm-flu lod for each strain is of similar order of magnitude as comparable estimates of analytical sensitivity reported from rt-pcr based methods, table 7 .each rpm assay of a single specimen is capable of generation from hundreds to thousands of nucleotides of multiple targeted pathogen gene sequence(s). gene sequences generated directly from rpm-flu assays may specify determinants of particular target pathogen phenotypes (virulence, drug resistance, host range, etc.), or support forensic queries of identity of detected strains in different specimens, or support genome diversity-based epidemiological tracking in the course of an infectious disease outbreak.rpm-flu assay-generated nucleotide sequences representing one or more target genes of each detected pathogen convey significantly more informative specificity than can be obtained from any singlet or multiples of rt-pcr tests. some rt-pcr protocols are designed to glean additional detail regarding detected pathogen genotypes, through results from multiple (serially executed) rt-pcr panels, but this approach imposes additional testing costs and time delays and yield far less specific information than actual target gene sequences provided from a single rpm assay.some platforms claim to differentiate selected type a influenza virus subtypes based upon indirect detection or specification of non-ha and non-na viral gene sequences [21, 22] . results in this report of rpm-flu assay-generated viral gene sequences from a variety of reference strains indicate that matrix m gene sequences are correlated with the subtypes of only seasonal human a/h1n1 and seasonal a/h3n2 strains. in general, however, non-ha and non-na viral gene sequences do not support reliable inference of type a influenza virus subtype.the rpm-flu assay panel simultaneously addresses 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria that are more or less likely to be encountered in specimens related to respiratory infections ( figure 1, figure s1 ). each assay simultaneously enables detection and identification of targeted pathogens from one or more of 188 different target gene resequencing detector tiles.for comparison, the recently fda-cleared luminexh respiratory viral panel (rvp) multiplex nucleic acid detection assay respiratory virus panel (510(k) k063765) is a twelve-plex rt-pcr panel for detection and differentiation of a few strains and types of respiratory viruses including adenovirus, influenza a virus (as a/h1 or a/h3), respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus and rhinovirus (no bacterial respiratory pathogens tested). the rvp assay yields no specimen-specific viral gene sequences that could be used for more detailed identification and differentiation of detected virus strains and variants of detected virus(es).for human and avian type a influenza viruses in particular, the rpm-flu provides direct detection and identification capability for any of the combinatorial 144 a/hn subtypes that may be present in a specimen, using an ensemble of 39 different influenza virus target gene resequencing detectors. the luminex rvp multiplex rt-pcr panel uses three of its twelve primer-probe sets to detect type a influenza virus (m gene-specific primer pair) and distinguish a/h1 from a/h3 (ha1-and ha3-specific primer it is not at all clear that such hierarchical rt-pcr protocols, attempting to increase analytical multiplicity through serial testing of the same specimen(s) at different laboratory venues over a period likely longer than a single day can be either efficient or costeffective. far more diagnostic intelligence about the patient and specimen would be available in first-day same-day results from a single rpm-flu test of the original specimen.influenza infections do not necessarily preclude co-infection of the same individual by other viral and/or bacterial pathogens (including other strains of influenza virus). such co-infections may confound a simple diagnosis of influenza, and may also compound morbidity and mortality for a co-infected patient. however it is not common practice that a positive result from a routine diagnostic influenza test would be followed by a call for one or more tests of possible secondary agents of infection. the single specimen single aliquot rpm-flu assay simultaneously targets 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria, and these were each selected as a respiratory pathogens reported to cause ''flu-like'' symptoms at some stage of human infection. implementation of a highly multiplexed differential diagnostic assay as rpm-flu would be of great advantage in anticipation of highly likely future influenza outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics. for many decades, leaders in the area of influenza epidemic and pandemic risk assessment and outbreak management have reviewed the pathology of influenza with respect to rapid deterioration and patient deaths attributable to secondary bacterial infections and pneumonia [23, 24] .it has taken almost twenty-five years from the first research reports of the polymerase chain reaction [25] until recent regulatory clearances have enabled introduction specific pcrand rt-pcr-based diagnostic assays and instrumentation into clinical practice. such a traditional regulatory clearance timeline may assure safety and efficacy of diagnostic devices beyond imaginable limits of liability, but it also assures that best practice standards for clinical diagnostics are constrained to technologies that perform with nearly obsolete capabilities and specifications. within the last decade resequencing microarrays have been introduced for research applications and clinical research [26, 27, 28] . it would be disappointing to anticipate that another decade or more may pass before benefits from diagnostic implementations of rpm or other highly multiplexed sequencing-based platforms can be realized in routine clinical diagnostics. table 1 ). found at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0008995.s003 (0.06 mb doc) the clinical significance of respiratory viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza viruses (pivs), human metapneumovirus (hmpv), rhinovirus (rhv), and adenovirus (adv) in patients with hematologic malignancies or recipients of autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) is well described [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . far less data have been published that specifically address the impact of coronavirus (cov) infection in these patients [9] . lower respiratory tract disease (lrtd) due to cov has been described on a case-report level [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , but a retrospective analysis of 46 bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) samples obtained from hsct recipients with any acute pulmonary process did not identify cov in any sample [3] . later, a prospective surveillance study in allogeneic hsct recipients performed at a single center over the course of one year found a relatively high cumulative incidence of cov infection (11%) in the first 100 days following allogeneic hsct, but only one case in which cov was detected in a lower respiratory tract sample [15] . other series studying the impact of respiratory viral infections have not specifically or directly assessed the clinical impact of cov in patients with hematologic malignancies and hsct recipients [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .with an apparently high frequency of infection but relative paucity of information pertaining to the impact of cov in patients with hematologic malignancies and hsct recipients, we conducted a retrospective review of all cov infections at our institution over a three year period in order to further characterize the role of cov in respiratory tract infections in these patients.all nasopharyngeal (np) and bal samples submitted from outpatient clinics and inpatient wards for respiratory virus testing between june 01, 2010 and july 01, 2013 at oregon health and science university (ohsu) were included in this study. demographic and clinical information pertaining to each patient testing positive for cov or other respiratory viruses assayed as part of a multiplex pcr panel (described below), were obtained by medical chart review.a patient was considered to have a hematologic malignancy if they were diagnosed with, and were receiving treatment for, any type of leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, mastocytosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, or amyloidosis. all patients who underwent allogeneic or autologous hsct, or cord blood transplant (cbt), were included and classified as such regardless of the underlying disease necessitating transplant.testing was performed using a multiplex respiratory virus pcr panel assay (xtag rvp; luminex) [23] per manufacturer's instructions. since this assay does not distinguish between rhv and enterovirus (env), these results are grouped together in this analysis. the cov pcr reagents that are included in the rvp testing kit were further validated for clinical testing (under college of american pathologists (cap)-and clinical laboratory improvement amendments (clia)-regulatory conditions) by the ohsu molecular diagnostics lab.a unique episode of infection was counted at the initial identification of a respiratory virus in an np or bal sample. when the same respiratory virus was identified in multiple consecutive samples from the same patient without interim negative test results, this was considered as representative of prolonged shedding, and was therefore counted as a single unique episode of infection.mortality was attributed to respiratory virus infection if death was due to respiratory failure without identification of a cause other than a respiratory virus [19] .respiratory virus inpatient-acquired infection was defined as onset of new symptoms, 4 days or more after admission to an inpatient ward.criteria for possible and proven lrtd were identification of a respiratory virus in an np sample (possible lrtd) or bal sample (proven lrtd), along with new pulmonary infiltrates on thoracic imaging [24] .comparison of categorical variables between viral groups was performed using two-tailed fisher's exact test. a total of 1661 np and bal samples obtained from the general hospital inpatient and outpatient populations -inclusive of, but not limited, to hsct recipients and hematologic malignancy patientswere analyzed. of these, 631 samples (38%) submitted during 461 unique episodes of infection tested positive for a respiratory virus (table 1) . cov was the third most-common virus identified after rhv/env and piv3, accounting for 43 (6.8%) positive samples. three bal specimens were positive for cov (see below), representing 7% of all cov-positive samples.of the 461 unique episodes of infection, 339 (73.5%) were in the hematologic malignancy and hsct patient populations (table 1) . cov was identified in 38 (8.2%) episodes among all patients, and 33 (9.7%) of episodes among hematologic malignancy and hsct patients. 19 (57.5%) of the 33 episodes of cov infection in the hsct and hematologic malignancy population were diagnosed during the winter months of december-march ( fig. 1 ).38 samples from the 33 hematologic malignancy and hsct patients tested positive for cov, with the majority (76.3%) being group i subtypes (nl63 (n = 15) and 229e (n = 14)), as compared to group ii subtypes (oc43 (n = 5) and hku1 (n = 4)). 30 of the 38 (78.9%) cov positive samples were positive only for cov, and the other 8 samples were co-infected with rhv [4] , rsv a [2] , hmpv [1] , and both rsv a and adv [1] .in order to better define the role of cov in respiratory tract syndromes among patients with hematologic malignancies and hsct recipients, we limited our clinical analysis to patients infected only with cov, excluding those co-infected with other respiratory viruses ( table 2 ). 29 patients were infected only with cov, and of those 28 (96.5%) had an underlying hematologic malignancy (n = 8) or had undergone allogeneic (n = 15) or autologous (n = 5) hsct. the clinical characteristics of cov infection in these 28 patients were examined and compared to episodes of mono-infection with other respiratory viruses (piv1-4, hmpv, rsv, and rhv/env) in the same patient population. the median age of those infected with cov was similar to the other respiratory viruses analyzed. surprisingly, cov was identified significantly more often in females (64%) than males compared to hmpv, piv1-4, and rhv/env, with a trend toward the same finding for rsv.five episodes of cov infection (17.8%) were hospital-acquired. four of these cases, all subtype nl63, occurred on the same inpatient hsct/oncology ward within a 60 day period between january 27 and march 24, 2012. while indicative of an epidemiological link, we were unable to conclusively prove this. according to surveillance performed as part of ohsu's infection control program, during this time period, only two other cases of nosocomial acquisition of a respiratory virus occurred on this ward -one rhv/env and one influenza a (personal communication, dr. lynne strasfeld).of cases acquired as an outpatient, 7 (30.4%) required admission to the hospital, typically for evaluation of fevers or new pulmonary infiltrates. the requirement for hospitalization during cov infection was not significantly different from those during infection with other respiratory viruses.similar to most other respiratory viruses, the majority of patients (85.7%) in whom cov was detected had uri symptoms (rhinorrhea, congestion, or sore throat). however, evidence of lrtd such as cough and new radiographic abnormalities was observed less frequently during cov infection, with a trend toward less hypoxemia as well. three patients (10.7%), all allogeneic hsct recipients, met criteria for possible cov lrtd (tables 2 and 3 ) based on the identification of cov from an np specimen and new radiographic abnormalities [24] , significantly less than during infection with the other respiratory viruses except rhv/env. none of these patients underwent bronchoscopy. two patients, both allogeneic hsct recipients, met criteria for proven lrtd based on identification of cov in a bal sample along with new radiographic abnormalities (tables 2 and 3 ) [24] . however, one of these patients also had rsv, adv, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus identified in the bal specimen, making the contribution of cov to lrtd unclear. the combined incidence of possible and proven lrtd was significantly lower during cov infection compared to all of the other respiratory viruses analyzed except rhv/env.four of the five cases of possible or proven lrtd occurred after day +100 following hsct, and all five were associated with acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (gvhd). a third episode of proven lrtd, accounting for the third cov-positive bal (table 1) , occurred in a patient who had not undergone hsct and did not have an underlying hematologic malignancy; characteristics of that case were therefore not further analyzed. there were no cases in which mortality was directly attributable to cov infection.the results presented here complement and expand upon the few existing studies evaluating the role of cov infection in the immunocompromised host [15] [16] [17] 25] . cov, primarily group i subtypes, was frequently identified in the hsct and hematologic malignancy populations when suspicion for a respiratory viral infection prompted diagnostic testing. in this population, cov infection was associated with similar rates of uri symptoms, nosocomial acquisition, and requirement for hospital admission compared to most other respiratory viruses. however, cov infection resulted in less possible and proven lrtd than other respiratory viruses with the exception of rhv/env.the frequency of detection of cov among all samples tested in this study is consistent with previous reports of cov detection in patients hospitalized with respiratory syndromes [15] [16] [17] . however, our results may not reflect the true prevalence of cov infection in our patients as we do not routinely screen asymptomatic patients; doing so would most likely increase the prevalence of infection due to detection in asymptomatic shedders [15] . it is also important to note that the true rate of influenza a and b infection is under-represented in our results since the initial test of choice for these pathogens at our institution is an influenza-specific pcr assay, not the respiratory virus panel used in this study. accounting for this would reduce the relative frequency of cov as well as that of all other non-influenza respiratory viruses.we found that the hematologic malignancy and hsct populations accounted for the majority of patients testing positive for cov and the other respiratory viruses. this finding almost certainly reflects testing bias in that these patients are more likely to be tested for respiratory viruses when symptomatic given the importance placed on these pathogens [9] . interestingly, we also found a female-predominant gender distribution among those infected with cov, which to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported before [15] [16] [17] 25, 26] . while the frequency of respiratory illnesses in the general population has been described to be higher among females, perhaps due to increased exposure [27] , if this was responsible for the higher burden of cov infection among women compared to men, then a similar pattern might be expected for the other respiratory viruses as well. this finding requires confirmation by additional studies.the majority (76.3%) of cov identified in the hematologic malignancy and hsct patients in this study belongs to group i. similarly, group i covs have been associated with infection in the immunocompromised host more than group ii covs in several series and case reports [12, 13, 15, 26, 28] . in contrast, studies involving general or pediatric patient populations have reported a majority of cov belonging to group ii [16, 17, 25, 26, [29] [30] [31] [32] . group i and ii covs differ in the mechanism of virus entry into the host cell and the degree of genetic variability, but whether these differences affect pathogenicity is not known [33] . indeed, reports associating cov subtypes with disease manifestations are conflicting [17, 26, 31] . further studies into the relative incidence of cov subtypes among various patient populations are necessary and may provide insight into fundamental biological differences between group i and ii subtypes.similar to previous reports [3, 15] , the rate of cov-proven lrtd was low but was not significantly different from other respiratory viruses. however, these results must be interpreted with caution since bronchoscopy, which we used as a criteria for defining "proven lrtd", is no longer done in many cases when a respiratory virus is identified in an upper airway sample at this institution or others [24] . analyzing "possible lrtd" instead, cov was indeed associated with significantly less disease compared to all the other respiratory viruses analyzed except rhv/env, with the rate of possible lrtd due to the other respiratory viruses in this report being generally consistent with the published literature [9, 24] . however, not all patients had radiography performed at the time of diagnosis of respiratory viral infection, which may bias the results toward those more likely to have evidence of lower respiratory tract illness. interestingly, all cases of possible and proven cov-associated lrtd occurred in hsct recipients, whereas the cases of possible and proven lrtd during infection with the other respiratory viruses were divided more evenly among hsct recipients and hematologic malignancy patients. additionally, all cases occurred in the setting of acute or chronic gvhd. taken together, these findings suggest that cov may be inherently less virulent compared to other respiratory viruses, and therefore, requires augmented immune suppression after hsct in order to progress to lrtd. the low number of cov-associated lrtd in this study precludes meaningful risk factor assessment but additional studies may make this more feasible.aside from lrtd, cov infection was associated with other clinically-relevant consequences. namely, 30% of outpatients were admitted to the hospital based on manifestations of cov infection, and hospital acquisition occurred in 5 cases, with a cluster of 4 nosocomially-acquired cases occurring within a 2 month span. additionally, 50% of cov-infected patients received an empiric course of antibacterial therapy (data not shown). notably, while cov is detected as part of the respiratory virus panel used at our institution during the study period, the cov results were not reported in the medical record since the assay was not approved by the food and drug administration for this purpose. in theory, a "negative" respiratory virus panel result may lead to more frequent admission to the hospital for further medical evaluation, antibacterial use, or nosocomial transmission. however, we found the rates of these events during cov infection to be similar to those during infection with other respiratory viruses ( table 2 and data not shown), highlighting the overall impact of respiratory viral infections in these patients in terms of utilization of medical resources.in conclusion, we found that cov is detected frequently in patients with hematologic malignancies and hsct recipients in whom suspicion for a respiratory viral infection exists, but is associated with less lrtd than other respiratory viruses except rhv/env. the retrospective nature of this work mandates confirmation of our findings by additional, prospective studies.statistical and epidemiological analyses in weekly data of active dynamic surveillance of influenza and influenza-like illness (ili) were carried out in shizuoka prefecture and all japan for the last 17 years (1986 -2003) .furthermore, virological, serological and genetic analyses were done with regard to (1) pathogen's information -mainly the viral subtypes (vaccine, herald and pandemic/ endemic strains) and (2) patient's information-mainly percentage (%) of hemagglutination inhibition (hi) antibody titers of shizuoka prefectural people in order to serve the prediction of usual and new (avian) types of influenza pandemics -interpandemics in the near future in all japan.(1) the weekly data were utilized from national and prefectural, active dynamic surveillance of influenza and ili in 1986-2003, reported due to the new raw of infectious disease control reestablished in 1999 and 2003. (2) several kinds of test samples from gurgled waters, pharyngeal wipes, sera and liquor derived from babies, young and school children, adults and old men in clinical institutions in shuizuoka prefecture were stocked at 4 jc. (a) from statistical and epidemiological analyses in weekly data of active dynamic surveillance of ili in shizuoka prefecture and all japan for the last 17 years (1986 -2003), differences were found in geographical (prefectural), annual and seasonal (winter and others) and age (generation) distributions [1 -3] . during the past 17 years, with the exception of a few seasons, the influenza pandemics usually started at about week 50 every year, showing the incidences over 1.0 patient per clinical institution, reached the peak at about week 5 of the next year, and ended over 10-15th week in shizuoka prefecture as well as all japan [1] [2] [3] . two biggest pandemics due to a/h3n2 subtype were seen in the 1989/1990 and 1997/1998 seasons, showing over 1 million (10â10 5 ) patients with ili in all japan. three bigger pandemics of a/h3n2 subtype were also seen in the 1992/1993, 1994/ 1995 and 1998/1999 seasons, showing over 8â10 5 patients [1 -3] .(b) the following results [1] [2] [3] were clarified from viral and serological analyses of influenza pandemics in japan:(1) by viral and genetic analyses of pandemic subtypes of influenza in shizuoka prefecture and all japan in three recent years (1998 -2000) , a/h3n2 and b subtype strains were isolated as one peak with shoulder in 1998/1999 season, however a/h1n1 and a/h3n2 subtype strains were isolated at the same time as a single peak, namely without viral interference, in 1999/2000 season [1 -3] . (1) the early detection of herald strains like b/shizuoka/1/98 strain in interpandemic periods every year is very important for vaccine-candidated strains and those productive supply in the following seasons [1] [2] [3] .(2) low anti-ha antibody (hi) titers under 10 in massive prevention suggest that the next pandemics due to new avian subtypes, e.g., h5n1 in hong kong, h7n7 in the netherlands and other highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) also could be predicted for a world-scale outbreak in the near future among unvaccinated population [1] [2] [3] .
