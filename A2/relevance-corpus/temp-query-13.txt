could apparently conclude given entirely new coronavirus nobody immune necessarily spread throughout world infect us kills <NUMBER> percent people follows total <NUMBER> billion people <NUMBER> million necessarily die difficult anyone specialist field understand outcome prevented vaccine virus yet exist medicines question casefatality rate among infected covid<NUMBER> exposed general lack epidemiological knowledge among general public media beginning pandemic people claimed new coronavirus disease milder even flu also believed significantly dangerous recent days issue finally caught attention world media world health organisation reported <NUMBER> infected coronavirus died <NUMBER> sounded terrifying media public president usa mr donald trump also made public statement saying number released wrong said hed talked people knew something impression number certainly <NUMBER> significantly less <NUMBER> guest appearance sunday <NUMBER> influential croatian tv programme march <NUMBER>st made estimate casefatality rate <NUMBER> allowing possibility could even smaller <NUMBER> namely point properly distinguish infectionfatality rate casefatality rate insights seroprevalence become available may even bring estimate however president trump actually right way shows best difficult many people keep track really going lack knowledge epidemiology beginning every epidemic new virus virus jump animals humans humans humans quite difficult therefore virus likely successfully infect weakened immune system find difficult reject first patients often people either older already underlying illnesses make vulnerable end hospital point one suspects pneumonia experiencing may epidemic potential infect hospital patients health care professionals latter spread disease patients hospital mainly susceptible ailing immunocompromised treated serious illnesses elderly reason casefatality rate among covid<NUMBER> patients initially high wuhan later italy many people died covid<NUMBER> infections hospitals mostly old sick people <NUMBER> meantime virus started spread among general population community outside hospitals infected many people otherwise healthy much better imeditorial mune response large number people would thought cold flu perhaps even severe flu resting home letting respiratory infections run course considering flu season wuhan time outbreak media reported strange epidemic causing many deaths wuhan hospitals quite likely many wuhan residents infected coronavirus stayed home treated people would choose go hospital test whether flulike symptoms caused novel coronavirus deadly epidemic spreading struggled fevers symptoms eight nine days sought help wuhan hospitals china typically primary health care family medicine know large hospitals huge cities patients report directly likely explanation casefatality rate among patients wuhan hospitals beginning epidemic frighteningly high epidemic seemed even dangerous first created great deal pressure hospital intensive care units unprepared infection result severely ill patients could receive intensive care increased casefatality rate beginning epidemic chinese started building two new hospitals wanted ensure sufficient capacity provide intensive care also needed move infected covid<NUMBER> away seriously ill people sick diseases highest risk dying became infected based understood total number infected covid<NUMBER> wuhan could much higher confirmed health statistics specifically coronaviruses eventually admitted hospital confirmed infected tested new virus means representative infected new coronavirus wuhan therefore early estimates casefatality rates wuhan cannot extrapolated even confirmed coronavirus infection wuhan let alone would representative entire population wuhan reasons wrong look number deaths number confirmed infected cases divide two numbers draw conclusions <NUMBER> reported deaths divided total number people confirmed infection numerator denominator wrong comes calculating actual casefatality rate even deaths numerator would wrong monitor confirmed infected died real time great many infected people even chance either recover die number deaths numerator underestimate people presently intensive care expected die several days weeks maybe even months number deaths corresponds number presently infected inevitably increase time therefore future number deaths numerator increasingly correspond current number registered infected persons denominator result casefatality rate deaths among confirmed infection longer <NUMBER> <NUMBER> percent may increase quite considerably time perhaps <NUMBER> percent even therefore simply say <NUMBER> confirmed infected far died really wrong world health organisation missed explaining casefatality rate among confirmed infected people quite unrepresentative mortality rate among infected <NUMBER> true rate much lower would surprise epidemiologist ten times smaller perhaps even <NUMBER> depending actual true number infected people used denominator could ultimately make covid<NUMBER> less deadly disease even common flu given virus new unknown key question unfortunately possibility virus quite different known viruses must also allowed may casefatality rate among confirmed infected people <NUMBER> <NUMBER> times higher infectionfatality rate ie number deaths among infected people may ten thirty times higher many epidemiologists would expect thing reasonably sure number confirmed infected people equal number infected people wuhan current global totals confirmed infected fatalities covid<NUMBER> still largely determined happened wuhan beginning epidemic twothirds cases worldwide still originate wuhan day <NUMBER> already explained sunday <NUMBER> tv programme casefatality rate

need tested presence antibodies coronaviruses detected measure seroprevalence <NUMBER> would allow us estimate number people wuhan got infection novel coronavirus without ever seeing doctor far one conducted studies health system preoccupied diagnosing treating epidemic covid<NUMBER> hospitals struggled understood days wuhan outbreak enough tests reported hospitals symptoms however additional lines evidence beginning emerge first report international panel experts visited china <NUMBER> looked cases across china reported february <NUMBER>st point identification infected significantly improved also hospitals better prepared epidemic casefatality rate cases came health surveillance tested dropped <NUMBER> <NUMBER> anyone may remain skeptical china data first reports recently provided south korean authorities country really led example proactively testing people seeking infected contacts isolating treating analyses date casefatality rate infected people slightly <NUMBER> <NUMBER> estimates could still increase albeit substantially also included likely die time currently counted infected still low casefatality rate many additional deaths fact likely many infected people remained undiagnosed casefatality rate actually even lower <NUMBER> another interesting recent new source study <NUMBER> hospitalized covid<NUMBER> patients followed end infection sample collected <NUMBER> chinese hospitals result published recently leading medical journal <NUMBER> analysis quoted overall casefatality rate <NUMBER> however include infected rather requested hospital

converge values predicted sunday <NUMBER> tv show march <NUMBER>st ie <NUMBER> president usa donald trump likely right say number closer <NUMBER> believes could even well <NUMBER> <NUMBER> everything know epidemiology previous pandemics gives us hope case virus succeed infecting everyone number reasons first line defence consists antiepidemic measures experiencing symptoms may infected tested

increase quickly new cases emerge slowly staff national health care systems able provide quality care patients severe cases also offer intensive care absence measures would exponential increase number infected people number would soon outgrow capacity health system many people within countries also protected geographical dispersion ie many people live smaller towns settlements large number probably never exposed infected person furthermore people become infected develop covid<NUMBER> get well become immune virus result fewer people virus still infect point number susceptible persons infected people spread coronavirus decrease substantially point infected person average pass virus less one susceptible person time eventually limit stop epidemic reason vaccinate even virus infects unvaccinated people options spread vaccinated people already immune virus bodies react vigorously virus tries enter <NUMBER> many processes nature selflimiting similar way forest fires stock market crashes epidemics furthermore casefatality rate directly applicable entire population country estimate possible death toll first reason virus mainly endangers elderly whose casefatality rates much higher young people children rarely get unwell death rates much much lower age sex structure population diminish potential virus cause high number covid<NUMBER> casualties population reasonably young <NUMBER> situation taken seriously people cautious reason overly afraid especially reason panic many people afraid pandemic probably think completely unfamiliar situation anything could happen unlikely much could happen science could find explanations answers epidemiological services could respond timely manner unwise serious scientist try predict spread completely new unknown virus entire human population world let alone predict specific outcomes still recent weeks collected enough information new covid<NUMBER> virus least predictions new coronavirus spreads across country time manages

serious dangerous serious flu actually especially vulnerable elderly already ill globally influenza causes editorial <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> deaths annually depending strain circulating virus <NUMBER> different strains cause milder severe symptoms virus mutates year however try protect vulnerable flu season begins vaccinating therefore number deaths influenza reduced preventive health intervention ie vaccination cannot done spread covid<NUMBER> first reason flu seems less dangerous covid<NUMBER> however may much less dangerous inherently especially seasons flu severe protect vulnerable addition flu vaccinations make difficult spread among population fewer options transfer uninfected due slower spread new cases emerge slowly health care system time deal properly especially require intensive care another reason number deaths directly flu several times lower number deaths indirectly caused flu influenza often cited direct cause statistics causes death merely led exacerbation longpresent chronic underlying disease chronic diseases cited primary cause death rather influenza therefore actual role influenza annual mortality often significantly underestimated several times higher causes death reclassified end year based increase deaths chronic diseases flu season third reason caution comparing covid<NUMBER> flu much better idea total number people truly infected flu novel coronavirus influenza disease typically managed within primary care patients referred home care serious cases flu referred hospital obligation report total number people infected influenza population central registry well sick leave makes denominator casefatality rate influenza better known us estimate novel coronavirus covid<NUMBER> far diagnosed treated exclusively hospitals severe cases clustered early estimates casefatality rates covid<NUMBER> included patients suffering hospital outbreaks affected elderly sick immunocompromised casefatality rates hardly comparable spread would occur general population concluded casefatality rates influenza another dangerous viral disease mathematically reduced compared current reports casefatality rates coronaviruses three reasons mentioned first vaccinate vulnerable flu second health statistics assign majority flu deaths influenza rather exacerbations preexisting underlying illnesses cardiovascular diseases diabetes malignant tumours others third denominator use calculate casefatality rates influenza much closer actual number infected denominator coronavirus yet known sufficient certainty experience respiratory

comparisons casefatality rates flu novel coronavirus learn seroprevalence latter general public underestimates risk influenza three reasons mentioned also likely overestimate risk new coronavirus due intense media focus influenza infections deaths monitored way year public would realise dangerous flu really reasonable vaccinated therefore still seem possible least stage pandemic decisively state two diseases inherently dangerous human beings eventually cause human deaths <NUMBER> flu cause fewer deaths vulnerable vaccinated health statistics properly attribute many indirect deaths flu really caused covid<NUMBER> turn cause fewer deaths due epidemiological surveillance prevention spread possible strict quarantine may also seasonal characteristics simply disappear arrival late spring means

could situation become much difficult first epidemiologists based experience previous epidemics pandemics expect covid<NUMBER> casefatality rate fall <NUMBER> total death toll divided better estimate total number infected people however virus new possible principle specific virus number infected individuals confirmed testing may large epidemiologists would expect would come surprise science would

higher registered infected population two three times eg ten times casefatality rate infected covid<NUMBER> could significantly higher flu combined lack available vaccine case would lead significantly higher number deaths flu however occurrence still prevented measures isolation patients contacts well quarantines applied case flu also hope winter ending new seasons arriving seasonality would slow completely hinder spread virus furthermore virus could spread infected people dangerous forms well milder forms previous experiences epidemics shown mutation milder forms likely mutation dangerous forms easily spread impossible either <NUMBER> countries variant would increase casefatality rate locally compared countries accelerate infection would put health systems really difficult situation intensive care units would soon become overburdened poorer care available casefatality rate infected would increase likely collapse part health system also tricky scenario many health care

fakenews routinely associated misinformation twitter users also means chances check tweet might misinformation checking replies replies tagged instance fakenews would indicator suspicion <NUMBER> fourth advise particularly study news partially false despite observed slower propagation might dangerous routinely resorting information provides desired reality rather facts mentioned may challenging users recognise claims false contain elements truth found case even professional factcheckers <NUMBER> still open question whether less partially false false information circulating twitter whether fact checkers likely debunk completely false claims fifthly recommend authorities carefully tailor online responses found spreading fake news emojis used appeal emotions one one hand would rather expect trusted source neutral noncolloquial tone hand seems advise able get typical tone social media eg also using emojis degree also advise authorities employ tools social media analytics help keep updated developing misinformation found example psycholinguistic analysis reveal particularities differ misinformation compared usual talk social media debunking fake news keeping information sovereignty arms race using social media analytics keep pace therefore advisable fact would recommend authorities employ methods ones discussed paper work expost also ongoing infodemic however owed limitation data analysis regarding api usage cf prior following section recommend making social media monitoring part communication strategy potentially also manually monitoring advise

show economic models good explain predict behavior people include motivations behaviors following third perspective relevant modeling pandemic social science particular social network analysis often used understand possible ways virus might spread firestone et al <NUMBER> nowadays much work area related online social media networks lot data easily available networks however spread virus physical social networks friends family colleagues etc main interest given enough data construct physical social networks good tool determine people might potentially big virus spreaders due role eg nurses elderly care due fact many contacts different contexts eg sports culture otherwise sparsely connected form bridges densely connected communities however knowing people roles one would like target controlling spread mean one device effective policies eg current pandemic clear closing schools possible bridge communities acceptable closing hospitals elderly care centres additional aspects included models order use theory practice semantics nodes networks needed well links nodes constituted links indicate number contacts per day people also change network based perception situation ie avoid contacts different types contacts establish new contacts etc social network analysis looks people nodes network people ones actually create maintain change social network government tries contain spread virus social networks give good indication might done effective people constituting network react policies included social network theory thus whether new links arise bypassing previous links persons take place socalled super spreaders cannot derived theory given short discussions different modeling perspectives crisis one conclude perspectives include assumptions human behavior models however behavior especially people influence others behavior part models propose take human behavior central perspective use linking pin connect different perspectives illustrated fig <NUMBER> next section discuss agent model assocc framework used fulfill central role couple different perspectives design assocc framework based fact individuals always balance needs many contexts research done past twenty years come sketch fig <NUMBER> illustrates people manage balancing act daily life assume people value system reasonably consistent times contexts domains value system based schwartz value circumplex schwartz <NUMBER> quite universal depicts number basic values everyone possesses relations people differ prioritize values rather values although priorities differ individuals reasonably consistent within cultural groups therefore values also seen linking individual drivers social group used abstract social science framework already vanhee et al <NUMBER> vanhée <NUMBER> cranefield et al <NUMBER> heidari et al <NUMBER> order use simulations formalized extended framework coupled concrete behaviour preferences context thus values give stable guideline behavior kept satisfied certain degree whenever possible thus conservatism important person general direct behavior things benefit preservation community second type drivers behavior fig <NUMBER> motives people common based theory mcclelland <NUMBER> four basic motives distinguished achievement motive drives us progress current situation something better whatever better might mean affiliation motive drives us together people socialize thus sometimes things together friends family power motive actually mean want power others rather want autonomous ie able tasks without anyones help finally avoidance motive lets us avoid situations know behave expect others motives active time whenever possible drive concrete behavior thus might go grandparents ask question rather text want chat third type elements determine behavior affordances context provides affordances determine kind behavior available also type behavior salient eg bar one often drinks alcohol even though obligatory salient also afforded easily individuals balance values motives affordances determine behaviour would appropriate situation one imagine quite tricky take much time energy done every situation scratch therefore human society developed social structures standardize situations behaviors order package certain combinations acceptable usually good even optimal social constructs things like norms conventions social practices organizations institutions note constructs give general guidelines defaults behavior physical restrictions possible implementing whole architecture would inefficient social simulation therefore use theoretical starting point translate simpler model efficient scalable thus assocc simulation framework fix important aspects values motives described architecture set needs illustrated following fig <NUMBER> figure seen model values motives needs deplete time nothing done satisfy model prevents agent look need highest priority ones need completely satisfied calibrating size threshold depletion rate need calibrate balance needs longer period different contexts several domains eg using model becomes possible decide individual whether important work bit go home family simple model crux behind combining health wealth social wellbeing simulation model fig <NUMBER> complete mapping values importance given type activities choices agents make moreover achievement motive

usually good others thus contributes social survival seen agents assocc wide range needs range social health economic dimensions society therefore also show interventions intended remedy eg spread virus influence dimensions due dependencies intended effect next section describe examples scenarios simulated assocc illustrate use range possible scenarios importance approach section briefly discuss two scenarios simulated assocc quite different aspects covid<NUMBER> crisis first question whether schools closed employees work home pandemic second investigates economic effects lockdown several weeks even months scenarios built model described shows richness model possibilities exploration new policies typically schools places children parents community gather potentially leads spreading virus epidemics emerge one common measure taken closure schools case influenzalike illnesses proven effective measure since children highly susceptible disease however covid<NUMBER> pandemic different seems less contagious children sweden one european countries kept primary junior school <NUMBER> years old open based premise closing schools would mean many parents jobs vital society like healthcare personnel would stay home take care children instead going work would delay efforts stem spread virus chang et al <NUMBER> already indicated closing schools would much effect australian situation scenario explore potential consequences keeping schools open spread virus also social economic aspects model direct indirect effect spread virus schools closed people work home assume schools closed soon certain amount infected people within city reached different thresholds tested paper schools closed whenever one infected person detected scenario assumes children staying home least one adult home take care caregiver assumed work home duration school closure particular look effect spreading coronavirus schools closed thus parents working home compared parents already working home children still going school fig <NUMBER> results closing schools working home shown show graph health status population activities taking place schools closed left two graphs people forced work home take care children scale horizontal axis denotes time four ticks make one day runs cover <NUMBER> months depending whether differences still appear <NUMBER> months vertical axes show

peaks saturday sunday show people go shopping weekend findings show measures lower peak expected even increase peak explained fact people want leave house weekend worked home week less social interaction public places typically people different communities gathered work school less group people present thus closing schools increases spreading virus thus without additional restrictions like social distancing closing restaurants effect working home closing schools surpassed side effect namely people wanting go covid<NUMBER> pandemic severe medical social consequences vast economic consequences well recession expected predictions show way severe banking crisis <NUMBER> recession thus governments trying minimize economic impact pandemic try minimize financial issues people companies giving massive b c fig <NUMBER> results financial support also pandemic dealt restarting economy big challenge many people lost jobs economic activity slowed minimum scenario demonstrate relation pandemic health measures economy shows complex interconnected nature situation many countries government locked country closed business operations cuts cycle income companies subsequently either people become unemployed governments temporarily take paying wages employees scenario show two different situations first shows happens lockdown government support second shows situation government supports companies taking wages government closes nonessential shops prevent spread orders lockdown curve pandemic really flattened within time span simulation see still experiencing many infections hardly deaths note lockdown starts one person infected much earlier real life people almost working home essential shops seem well seen hoarding behavior people want make sure enough essential products still money buy things buy anything nonessential shops closed online shopping simulation nonessential shops go bankrupt simulation assume could postpone fixed costs like loans rent etc fixed costs taking account nonessential shops go bankrupt pretty quick without government intervention velocity money flowing system decreases due lockdown fig <NUMBER> second situation government takes wages people working nonessential shops overall see capital increasing slightly explained due fact people cannot spend money nonessential products leisure activities going cafes sport events etc number unemployednonpayed people relatively small fig <NUMBER> economic activity kept government however government reserves quickly depleting less tax coming subsidies paid situation sustainable paper shown crises like covid<NUMBER> crisis interventions government made quick often based little information partial insights consequences interventions cases health perspective leading perspective inform government decisions however models used epidemiologists lack part human behavior therefore translate government interventions expected reactions citizens parameters parameters epidemic model without able check interdependencies shown assocc platform good addition current epidemiological economic models putting human behavior model central core connect health wealth social perspectives general several advantages using agent based tool like assocc first tool like assocc explicitly avoids providing detailed predictions rather supports investigating consequences perspectives government policies comparing variations policies like government subsidizing people economic scenario becomes clear consequences fundamental choices made taking stance avoids politicians able blame model giving wrong advice technology give single solutions decision makers support decision makers good insight consequences decisions fundamental priorities weighed eg joy life elderly people risks meeting family becoming infected risk contagion happening schools vs social disruption schools closed due agent based nature also possible explain results come eg closing schools might positive effect spread virus due kinds side effects scenario could see people going nonessential shops weekend home take care children week need belonging went going shops option left leisure places closed tracing behavior back way helps explain basic cause chain something done one wants avoid behavior steps causal chains based solid theory socialpsychological economic epidemiological case thus checked plausibility well theoretical foundation using agent based models makes easier adjust parameters simulation based differences demographics cultural dimensions different countries also different regions even neighbourhoods big towns therefore finegrained analysis performed impact government interventions different parts country eg rich poor neighbourhoods urban rural areas affected different ways measure finally stress claim agent based models like used assocc replace domain specific models actually one could use assocc simulate intervention scenarios study human reactions consequences good insight

might mean affiliation motive drives us together people socialize thus sometimes things together friends family power motive actually mean want power others rather want autonomous ie able tasks without anyones help finally avoidance motive lets us avoid situations know behave expect others motives active time whenever possible drive concrete behavior thus might go grandparents ask question rather text want chat third type elements determine behavior affordances context provides affordances determine kind behavior available also type behavior salient eg bar one often drinks alcohol even though obligatory salient also afforded easily individuals balance values motives affordances determine behaviour would appropriate situation one imagine quite tricky take much time energy done every situation scratch therefore human society developed social structures standardize situations behaviors order package certain combinations acceptable usually good even optimal social constructs things

rules staying inside lockdown going school work requested need negative value case agent decides break rule need autonomy satisfied agents able follow plans agents satisfy need autonomy able make

believes sick need also fitted conformity need people conform people uncertain context action best take conforming others safe usually good others thus contributes social survival seen agents assocc wide range needs range social health economic dimensions society therefore also show interventions intended remedy eg spread virus influence dimensions due dependencies intended effect next section describe examples scenarios simulated assocc illustrate use range possible scenarios importance approach section briefly discuss two scenarios simulated assocc quite different aspects covid<NUMBER> crisis first question whether schools closed employees work home pandemic second investigates economic effects lockdown several weeks even months scenarios built model described shows richness model possibilities exploration new policies typically schools places children parents community gather potentially leads spreading virus epidemics emerge one common measure taken closure schools case influenzalike illnesses proven effective measure since children highly susceptible disease however covid<NUMBER> pandemic different seems less contageous children sweden one european countries kept primary junior school <NUMBER> years old open based premise closing schools would mean many parents jobs vital society like healthcare personnel would stay home take care children instead going work would delay efforts stem spread virus <NUMBER> already indicated closing schools would much effect australian situation scenario explore potential consequences keeping schools open spread virus also social economic aspects model direct indirect effect spread virus schools closed people work home assume schools closed soon certain amount infected people within city reached different thresholds tested paper schools closed whenever one infected person detected scenario assumes children staying home least one adult home take care caregiver assumed work home duration school closure particular look effect spreading coronavirus schools closed thus parents working home compared parents already working home children still going school figure <NUMBER> results closing schools working home shown show graph health status population activities taking place schools closed left two graphs people forced work home take care children scale horizontal axis denotes time four ticks make one day runs cover <NUMBER> months depending whether differences still appear <NUMBER> months vertical axes show number agents around <NUMBER> number vary slightly depends household distribution way households generated results based <NUMBER> runs although number people home course much higher people places green line bottom plots compared baseline simulation implies less spreading virus peak infected people higher around <NUMBER> <NUMBER> resp peak reached around time ie <NUMBER> ticks <NUMBER> days number people died <NUMBER> <NUMBER> resp means differences significant closing schools health b working home health c closing schools activity working home activity figure <NUMBER> results also see difference people going nonessential shops black line activity graphs number people nonessential shops right last two peaks saturday sunday show people go shopping weekend findings show measures lower peak expected even increase peak explained fact people want leave house weekend worked home week less social interaction public places typically people different communities gathered work school less group people present thus closing schools increases spreading virus thus without additional restrictions like social distancing closing restaurants effect working home closing schools surpassed side effect namely people wanting go covid<NUMBER> pandemic severe medical social consequences vast economic consequences well recession expected predictions show way severe banking crisis <NUMBER> recession thus governments trying minimize economic impact pandemic try minimize financial issues people companies giving massive financial support also pandemic dealt restarting economy big challenge many people lost jobs economic activity slowed minimum scenario demonstrate relation pandemic health measures economy shows complex interconnected nature situation many countries government locked country closed business operationsthis cuts cycle income companies subseqently either people become unemployed governments temporarily take paying wages employees scenario show two different situations first shows happens lockdown government support second shows situation government supports companies taking wages government closes nonessential shops prevent spread orders lockdown curve pandemic really flattened within time span simulation see still experiencing many infections hardly deaths note lockdown starts one person infected much earlier real life people almost working home essential shops seem well seen hoarding behavior people want make sure enough essential products still money buy things buy anything nonessential shops closed online shopping simulation nonessential shops go bankrupt simulation assume could postpone fixed costs like loans rent etc fixed costs taking account nonessential shops go bankrupt pretty quick without government intervention velocity money flowing system decreases due lockdown second situation government takes wages people working nonessential shops overall see capital increasing slightly explained due fact people cannot spend money nonessential products leisure activities going cafes sport events etc number unemployednonpayed people relatively small economic activity kept government however government reserves quickly depleting less tax coming subsidies paid situation sustainable paper shown crises like covid<NUMBER> crisis interventions government made quick often based little information partial insights consequences interventions cases health perspective leading perspective inform government decisions however models used epidemiologists lack part health population b activity c capital per age group government reserves figure <NUMBER> results government subsidy human behavior therefore translate government interventions expected reactions citizens parameters parameters epidemic model without able check interdependencies shown assocc platform good addition current epidemiological economic models putting human behavior model central core connect health wealth social perspectives general several advantages using agent based tool like assocc first tool like assocc explicitly avoids providing detailed predictions rather supports investigating consequences perspectives government policies comparing variations policies like government subsidizing people economic scenario becomes clear consequences fundamental choices made taking stance avoids politicians able blame model giving wrong advice technology give single solutions decision makers support decision makers good insight consequences decisions fundamental priorities weighed eg joy life elderly people risks meeting family becoming infected risk contagion happening schools vs social disruption schools closed due agent based nature also possible explain results come eg closing schools might positive effect spread virus due kinds side effects scenario could see people going nonessential shops weekend home take care children week need belonging went going shops option left leisure places closed tracing behavior back way helps explain basic cause chain something done one wants avoid behavior steps causal chains based solid theory socialpsychological economic epidemiological case thus checked plausability well theoretical foundation using agent based models makes easier adjust parameters simulation based differences demographics cultural dimensions different countries also different regions even neighbourhoods big towns therefore finegrained analysis performed impact government interventions different parts country eg rich poor neighbourhoods urban rural areas affected different ways measure finally stress claim agent based models like used assocc replace domain specific models actually one could use assocc simulate intervention scenarios study human reactions consequences good insight dependencies one feed domain specific models better information make precize optimizations predictions effect

inclusion sample cities becomes technical trouble since reported number laboratoryconfirmed patients lagged accurate especially early stage outbreak large number potential patients epicenter rush hospitals local hospitals lack test kits confirm whether patients novel coronavirus short period time main reason lagged report confirmed numbers addition patients mild symptoms may cured timely confirmed covid<NUMBER> case wuhan city earlier stage epidemic also case emerging epicenters elsewhere cities europe us therefore paper try three groups estimation using full sample subsample without

paper total length built urban metro lines matter affect virus infection every increase <NUMBER> km lines increases confirmed infection number <NUMBER> although quantity appears tiny statistically

two findings show clearly direction shall pay attention contain virus spread first glance findings counterintuitive since common sense familiar suggests larger cities denser population easily spread

especially wuhan small cities even rural cities <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> areas result two reasons special time period transmission risk novel coronavirus small cities even rural areas may larger big cities statistical result shown paper fact confirms proposition addition cities annual quantity wastewater discharged <NUMBER> larger increase confirmed infection number <NUMBER> p value around <NUMBER> significant statistic sense well also cities residential garbage connected transported <NUMBER> larger increase confirmed infection number <NUMBER> see p value around <NUMBER> strong signal influence infection two findings statistically strong enough provide new clues possible direction investigation spread covid<NUMBER> although coronavirus type disease typically considered infection

decline peoples current income constitutes economic cost pandemic preparedness shown figure <NUMBER> sense question whether onset decline demand supply shock essential pertinent question whose income reduce governments counterpandemic measures reduced income individuals firms basically reducing supply goods services whether directly indirectly short reduced supply goods services faced income

respect industrial health capital income production goods services figure <NUMBER> economic cost lockdown peacetime point peacetime income lockdown point minimum required income economic cost lockdown employment conditions depends government regulation affects firm household incomes demand supply shocks hence many governments dealt pandemics simultaneously offered form financial assistance compensation lost work fixed benefits companies individuals bear particularly heavy burden policy objectives public support always clear following benefits generally expected first livelihood compensation economically deprived households lost income primarily measure aimed lowincome people little savings second provision economic incentives leaves absence work becomes especially important government measures remain moral imperative rather legal regulation absence absenteeism fixed benefits always people willing go work instead staying home financial reasons trend particularly strong among lowincome people savings sense governments support measures focused livelihood compensation also serve economic incentive keep people home instead permitting go work another important role governments economic support enable social sharing economic costs incurred due counterpandemic measures noted economic costs preventing spread infection securing necessary health capital epidemic

therefore mass media outlets pundits already begun express concern future expansion budget deficit since expansion budget deficit due public support government inevitable concerns probably become

situation crowdingout mechanism arise deficit financing lead burden future generations economist articulated logic clearly paul samuelson one leading economists <NUMBER>th century discussed detail problem future generations burden government deficit financing <NUMBER> samuelson first presents conclusion issue follows main ways one generation put burden later generation using currently nations

generalized proposition government debt burden future generations unless reduces future consumption possibilities conversely government debt future generational burden reduces future consumption possibilities people may called lernersamuelson proposition future generational burden government deficit financing since abba lerner laid foundation reasoning lerner pointed whether public debt

bonds still receive payments consumption possibilities whole necessarily decline <NUMBER> contrast case external debt current generation cut spending future generations truncate government tax collection repay debt citizens consumption possibilities future generations necessarily reduced amount <NUMBER> thus external public debt necessarily burden future generations lerners argument implies future generational burden necessarily arise long public debt external imply arise principle case internal debt samuelson points even public debt internal future possibilities production consumption decrease renewal accumulation capital stock inhibited debt generally deficitfinancing policies undertaken full employment economy likely result tighter capital markets higher interest rates crowding private investment therefore future generational <NUMBER> noted generation discussion lerner samuelson means people living certain point time different usual generational concept people born certain point time <NUMBER> lerner says economists need reminded children grandchildren repay national debt payments made children grandchildren nobody else taking altogether impoverished making repayments enriched receiving lerner <NUMBER> p<NUMBER> burdens certainly arise even debts internal consideration leads precise version lernersamuelson proposition public debt burden future generations absorbed domestically reduce domestic capital stock subsequently implying reduction future consumption possibilities proposition holds strictly true ricardian economy wherein people behave equate current tax increases future tax increases due bond issues case peoples saving spending behavior change whether government spending financed higher taxes bond issues therefore fiscal deficits mean neither higher interest rates greater external debts even nonricardian economies lernersamuelson proposition holds least approximately underemployment economy unemployment due lack demand exists traditional keynesian models islm model show government implements deficit fiscal policy increase interest rates crowding private investment however degree crowding contained income savings increase due demandled growth induced fiscal spending short public debt necessarily imply future generational burden whether burden arises depends entirely economic situation samuelson points impact buildup public debt internal debt appears much expansion future burden rather income transfer different strata society government bonds public debt nothing assets bondholders right acquire goods services future thus long governmentissued bonds continue absorbed country private sector assets continue grow economic conditions country decide macroeconomic effect expansion private assets ricardian economy private sector asset signifies future tax increases therefore would completely offset public debt thus deficit financing would macroeconomically neutral means robert barro argued government debt cannot net wealth private sector barro <NUMBER> however nonricardian economy traditional keynesian economics premised economic expansionary effect deficitfinancing government spending usually greater taxfinancing government spending obvious difference two arises domestic distribution purchasing power holders government bonds private sector relatively greater access goods services without purchasing power effect depend whether economy ricardian nonricardian decision economic agent whether cut spending buy governmentissued bonds created debt merely result intertemporal consumption choices economic agentwhether cut current spending obtain future goods services simply desire current goods services important message samuelsons argument future burden deficit financing economic truth burden created government spending whether financed bond issues tax increases ultimately borne current generation future generations samuelson uses example wartime costs illustrate worth considering following context supplementary argument chapter <NUMBER> economics debt came world war ii samuelson <NUMBER> p<NUMBER> war usually requires artillery ammunition government spending funded either higher taxes public debt suppose costs covered bonds rather taxes even burden future generations arise public debt absorbed domestically result crowding private investment confirm consider economy capital stock therefore investment people devote income time time consumption speak economy based solely hunting gathering consumptiononly investmentfree economy selfevident matter much manpower used production artillery ammunition result burden future generations future generations could produce artillery ammunition cannot bring present unless possess time machine thus case burden producing artillery ammunition would eventually borne entirely current generation form reduction consumption always constraints production resources labor human resources allocated production artillery ammunition production consumer goods must reduced conclusion whether wartime costs financed higher taxes public debt merely question burden shared within current generation financed tax increase taxpayer reduced disposable income bear cost reduced consumption contrast financed public bonds cost borne voluntarily reduce consumption purchase bonds however strong conclusion fiscal burdens borne future generations present generation derived assumption foreign sector capital stock thus means universally true always future burdens public bonds absorbed overseas even absorbed internally future burdens reduce domestic investment capital stock regardless burden future generations individuals must reduce consumption due governments policy clearly burden generation people sense burden governments policy considered borne current generation rather future generations conclusion holds governments counterpandemic measures shown previous section imposing public regulations prevent spread infection necessarily reduces level economic activity reduction demand supply lockdown difference income peacetime lockdown precisely economic loss figure <NUMBER> thus public regulations prevent spread infection affects economy form demand supply shocks shrinking overall production goods services however extent impact vary depending circumstances firm household located areas devastated entertainment industry food beverage industry others rather expand supply maskmaking industry economic burden thus created entirely borne present generation whether financially supported public debt exactly case burden war expenditures current generation people reducing production consumption goods services imposed counterpandemic measures amount public debt piles time deter private investment unemployment expands due falling demand interest rates continue fall thus future production consumption possibilities depressed bond rather possibilities would better would without governments economic support measures successfully prevented expansion corporate bankruptcies unemployment apparently measures deficitfinanced involve tax since must implemented without reducing peoples disposable income wartime economy people sometimes forced severely cut back consumption japan world war ii moral slogans luxury enemy dont want win imposed people government comes economic principle free lunch everything involves tradeoffs therefore obtain artillery ammunition needed carry war current generation choice reduce consumption divert productive resources used produce consumer goods production artillery ammunition resulting decline consumption burden current generation meanwhile economy pandemic preparedness lockdowns greatest burden current generation come form decline income present generation subsequently involuntarily forced produce nonincomegenerating leisure instead producing artillery ammunition people would prefer earn income engaging economic activities enjoy consumption goods services income rather excessive leisure current generations income consumption lost situation resulting economic burden counterpandemic measures society faced pandemic preliminary decisions involve measures used extent imposed deter spread disease goal minimize losses society suffers goal quite simple decision far simple stronger policy prevent spread disease greater economic losses likely tradeoff economic activity epidemic prevention precisely tradeoff continue struggle decision impose lockdowns infection spread duration continue fact lockdown result economic loss society happily continue comply tradeoff economic activity epidemic prevention signifies decisions regarding pandemic deterrence nothing less judgments priorities extent given quarantine policy effective deterring infection purely empirical epidemiological question nothing value judgments however matter epidemiologically effective policy may immediate justification implementation involves economic loss results income reduction order implement policy social consensus based exact value judgment necessary benefits reducing social losses sure exceed economic losses caused another issue must consider regarding economic costs pandemic deterrence ultimately shared society see economic burden policies prevent spread infection falls class society unequal way varies across industries depends individuals employment category people lost jobs income entirely policies others able maintain existing income enjoy extra leisure time preventing spread infection obvious public good benefits members society yet cost unequally shared therefore governments provide form financial support absenteeism fixed benefits along policies deter spread infection biggest obstacle public support measures universal concern lead deterioration government finances existence apprehensions may cases distort judgments far go deter spread infection plausible nations may lift lockdown avoid expansion public assistance even though remains significant risk spread infection however samuelson argued since many governments policies carried using current rather future labor resources much burden eventually borne current generation even public bonds issued implement measures mean burden passed future generations extent public debt merely changes distribution goods services future according current saving spending behavior economic agent applies public assistance provided part counterpandemic measures current generation already bearing heavy burden shrinking incomes consumption even public support provided issuing public bonds thereby expanding government debt burden current generation could passed future generations therefore basis notion government economic support withheld much possible order avoid leaving burden future generations however considerations future burden deficit financing deny accumulation public debt effect economy whole generally economy nonricardian increase public debt would act greater expansion peoples spending would mean increase private assets future claim goods services therefore stage governments central banks may carry macroeconomic tightening using fiscal monetary policies contain price increases due expansion private spending suggests failure governments central banks make macroeconomic adjustments could lead economic disruptions fiscal collapse soaring
