right getting messaging president difficult hear frontline health care provider dont feel like back thats unfortunate political issue coronavirus neither democrat republican neither look president incident commander time crisis like president choice two ways lead one either lead inspiration rally troops battle confuse via mixed messaging even accusing us stealing masks selling back door like
