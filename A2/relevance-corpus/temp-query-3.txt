félins et porcins le virus de lib ibv le coronavirus de la dinde meleagridis gallopavo et celui du faisan de colchide phasianus colchicus avec lesquels il des relations génétiques font partie du

néphrite mineure ou majeure de loviducte et en différents endroits du tractus alimentaire oesophage proventricule duodénum jéjunum bourse de fabricius amygdales caecales rectum et cloaque sans causer de troubles cliniques le virus peut persister puis être reexcrété au début de la ponte à lâge de <NUMBER> à <NUMBER> mois passant pour être une conséquence du stress au moment de lentrée en ponte des lignées génétiques de poulet réagissent différemment à libv notamment en ce qui concerne la mortalité chez les poulets et la clearance du virus après la phase aiguë les souches dibv atténuées par passage sur oeufs embryonnés ont été utilisées comme vaccins dans les années <NUMBER> puis une vingtaine dannées plus tard des vaccins inactivés ont été développés pour booster la protection des animaux en ponte les vaccins à virus vivants sont généralement administrés à lâge dun jour chez les poulets de chair dans les conditions expérimentales ceci peut entraîner une immunité stérile lors dune épreuve à virus virulent homologue bien que <NUMBER> des poulets peuvent être protégés contre les signes cliniques et la perte de lactivité ciliaire au niveau de la trachée il arrive que <NUMBER> des poulets vaccinés ne présentent pas de réponse immune protectrice la protection conférée par les souches vivantes est courte elle commence à décliner neuf semaines après la vaccination pour les vaccins préparés avec des souches très atténuées libv présente de nombreux sérotypes définis par séroneutralisation la protection croisée est souvent faible en conséquence les poulets doivent être revaccinés avec le même ou un autre sérotype deux ou trois semaines plus tard une simple administration de vaccin inactivé entraîne généralement une protection des sujets inférieure à <NUMBER> daprès certaines publications deux administrations entraînent <NUMBER> à <NUMBER> de protection mais pour dautres la protection est inférieure à <NUMBER> sur le terrain les vaccins inactivés sont administrés aux futures adultes qui ont reçu au préalable deux ou trois vaccins à virus vivants atténués ceci augmente la protection des animaux adultes contre les pertes de protection en oeufs et induit des

du ibv exprimée en baculovirus ou chez des oiseaux ayant reçu le vecteur viral variole aviaire induit des anticorps neutralisants vn des réponses immunes et protectrices ont été induites mais plusieurs inoculations sont nécessaires et pour autant le pourcentage de poulets protégés est trop faible b <NUMBER> pour être utilisés sur le terrain il est à souligner que lexpression de s<NUMBER> chez des oiseaux après administration dun vecteur adénovirus aviaire non pathogène induit une protection de <NUMBER> et de <NUMBER> des poulets au cours de deux expérimentations des différences aussi

acides aminés peuvent changer le sérotype suggérant quun petit nombre dépitopes sont immunodominants en ce qui concerne les anticorps neutralisants des études préliminaires sur le rôle de la protéine de capside n de libv au niveau immunitaire ont suggéré que limmunisation avec n exprimé en bactérie bien que ninduisant pas directement une protection amélioré linduction de la protection lors de linoculation ultérieure dun ibv inactivé dans une autre étude deux immunisations intramusculaires dun plasmide exprimant n ont induit une immunité protectrice la base de limmunité de libv nest pas encore parfaitement connue les taux danticorps sériques ne sont pas corrélés avec la protection même si les anticorps locaux jouent un rô le des transferts de cellules alphabéta induisant linfection de libv portant lantigène cd<NUMBER> ont protégé des poulets contre une épreuve virulente en conclusion les vaccins vivants atténués de libv induisent une bonne protection bien que de courte durée visàvis dune épreuve homologue même si une minorité dindividus ont des réponses faibles les vaccins inactivés de libv sont insuffisamment efficaces quand ils sont administrés une seule fois en absence de vaccins à virus vivants administrés préalablement deux administrations de vaccin inactivé dibv sont beaucoup plus efficaces bien que cela ne soit pas une proposition valable pour lindustrie avicole quoi quil en soit le coût et la logistique de ladministration multiple de vaccin inactivé du sars devraient être beaucoup acceptables pour la protection des populations humaines principalement sil sagit de groupes ciblés tels que le personnel soignant et les contacts à risque élevé ladministration dun vaccin contre le sars est certainement mieux si elle est limitée à un petit nombre dindividus ciblés qui pourront être suivis en effet les personnes vaccinées peuvent si elles sont infectées par le coronavirus du sars devenir asymptomatiques excrétrices de virus et ainsi présenter un risque
