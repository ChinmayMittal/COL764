antigene variatie van het influenzavirus kan klein groot zijn het eerste geval spreekt men van antigene drift binnen één tot vijf jaar ontstaat er zo telkens een nieuwe virusvariant tijdens een infectie ontstaan er namelijk grote hoeveelheden viruspartikels met veel varianten de variant met veranderingen het hemagglutinine en neuraminidase die het minste hinder ondervindt van bestaande antilichamen wordt verantwoordelijk voor de jaarlijkse epidemieën maar het virus kan op nog veel drastischer wijze veranderen bij de antigene shift wordt een compleet gen dat codeert voor een oppervlakteeiwit uitgewisseld voor een ander gen van een virus uit een nietmenselijk reservoir de meeste gevallen betreft het dan een vogelgriepof aviair virus een dergelijke antigene shift kan de

geven aan dat er voor dit merkwaardige fenomeen nooit een goede verklaring gevonden terwijl anderen suggereren dat een cytokinestorm aan dit verschijnsel debet geweest eenvoudig gezegd komt deze hypothese erop neer dat een op hol geslagen afweersysteem waarbij vooral wordt gedacht aan tlymfocyten binnen korte tijd fatale schade toebrengt aan het lichaam en dat niet zozeer het virus zelf hiervoor verantwoordelijk dit zou verklaren dat vooral jonge gezonde volwassenen met een optimaal functionerend afweersysteem zo snel en zo zwaar werden getroffen <NUMBER> werden hongkong achttien

het h<NUMBER>n<NUMBER>virus een vaccin een dergelijk vaccin zou al vó ó r een epidemie gegeven kunnen worden om het immuunsysteem te primen bij het vaststellen van het definitieve pandemische virus zou dan slechts een tweede iets gewijzigd vaccin nodig zijn om het voorbereide systeem te boosteren de registratie zou dan snel kunnen verlopen zodat daarmee geen tijd verloren zou gaan de gezondheidsraad bereidde begin <NUMBER> een advies daartoe voor de zeggenschap de gezondheidszorg berust de europese unie bij de lidstaten het europese centre disease control ecdc het verleden wel toegezien op de pandemische voorbereiding de lidstaten maar speelde de advisering vaccinatie en behandeling met antivirale middelen geen enkele rol het gevolg dat er europa <NUMBER> verschillende protocollen voor de bestrijding van de pandemie bestonden het unieke aan deze pandemie dat nooit eerder een pandemisch virus zo snel gedetecteerd en getypeerd ook de verspreiding van epidemiologische gegevens ging snel en het beleid kon op basis van deze evidence voortdurend worden bijgesteld via elektronische media kon de implementatie van dat beleid ook snel plaatsvinden de voorlichting aan de bevolking en ook aan de gezondheidszorgmedewerkers kon dit maar net bijhouden waardoor soms de indruk van een zwalkend beleid ontstond zo het oorspronkelijke advies om iedere patiënt met griep tijdens de pandemie met een antiviraal middel te behandelen dit advies lag ten grondslag aan de opslag van vijf miljoen kuren oseltamivir en kleinere aantallen zanamivir bij een geschatte ziektelast van een derde van de bevolking zou dan voldoende medicijn beschikbaar zijn de bedoeling vooral om daarmee de top van de epidemie af te vlakken waardoor complicaties minder zouden voorkomen en een grotere tijdspanne zouden worden gespreid daarmee zou de beschikbare ziekenhuiscapaciteit langer voldoende zijn aangezien bleek dat de pandemie tot milde ziekteverschijnselen leidde leek behandeling van iedere patiënt met griep met oseltamivir niet meer aan de orde de bijwerkingen van het middel zouden bij een dergelijk uitgebreide toepassing wellicht erger zijn dan de kwaal de sterfgevallen bleken vooral bij patiënten uit de bekende risicogroepen te liggen bij kinderen onder de <NUMBER> jaar en bij zwangeren het derde trimester bij die laatste groep leek de beperkte bewegingsmogelijkheid van het diafragma een belangrijke oorzaak want ook bij mensen met fors overgewicht werd meer sterfte gevonden het rivm bracht samen met de gezondheidsraad een advies uit om deze groepen met oseltamivir te behandelen mits mogelijk binnen <NUMBER> uur na de start van september het vaccin nog niet beschikbaar en gezondheidszorgpersoneel liep dus grote kans op besmetting voorzorgsmaatregelen als mondkapjes en handalcohol werden geadviseerd de adviezen van vó ó r die tijd met bijvoorbeeld disposable schorten werden teruggedraaid wel bleef het advies om patiënten thuis te bezoeken om zo besmetting op de praktijk te voorkomen vooral op huisartsenposten bleek dit advies moeilijk te implementeren en leidde het tot veel telefoontjes en gescheiden patiëntenstromen de dreiging van het instorten van de gezondheidszorg door overbelasting met patiënten massale uitval van personeel bestond nog steeds de ghor de geneeskundige hulpverlening bij ongevallen en rampen maakte plannen om de gezondheidszorg zo veel mogelijk intact te houden regionale verschillen uitvoering van de plannen maakten het voor de huisarts weinig overzichtelijk er kwamen plannen voor zorgmeldpunten die ingericht zouden worden bij uitval van huisartsenpraktijken deze zouden gevestigd worden hotels en kazernes en zij zouden bemand moeten worden door dezelfde huisartsen die nu net uitgevallen waren plannen om huisartsenposten ook overdag open te stellen waren wellicht reëler de vaccins waren besteld maar de levering zou nog even duren bovendien de afspraak met de producent dat per maand een bepaald percentage van de bestelde hoeveelheid zou worden afgeleverd landen die weinig bestelden bijvoorbeeld alleen voor de risicogroepen kregen slechts een gedeelte tijdig geleverd aangezien nederland voor de totale bevolking besteld kwamen voldoende vaccins voor de risicogroepen november binnen op <NUMBER> augustus adviseerde de gezondheidsraad om de bekende risicogroepen te vaccineren aangevuld met werkers de gezondheidszorg met directe patiëntencontacten en zwangeren <NUMBER> gezinsleden van patiënten met een hoog risico kwamen ook aanmerking voor de vaccinatie de huisartsen hadden het seizoensvaccin al huis en er genoeg tijd om ook dat toe te dienen nog steeds het onduidelijk de gewone griep met influenza h<NUMBER>n<NUMBER> niet ook nog zou gaan circuleren gevolg dat de risicogroepen drie vaccinaties moesten krijgen eenmaal voor de seizoensgriep en twee keer voor de mexicaanse griep de omvang van de risicogroep voor de mexicaanse griep groter vanwege de toevoeging van de zwangeren de huisgenoten van hoogrisicopatiënten en het personeel van de huisartsenpraktijk zelf nadat de vaccinatie van de bekende risicogroepen afgesproken ontstond angst voor verdere verspreiding onder kinderen veel kinderen werden vaak uit voorzorg opgenomen maar sommige belandden op de kinderic tijdens de jaarwisseling wanneer vaak het rsvirus en het influenzavirus elkaar afwisselen de bezetting van kinderics normaliter al hoog teneinde te voorkomen dat de kinderafdelingen zouden worden overspoeld met kinderen met influenza werd op <NUMBER> november besloten om alle kinderen ouder dan <NUMBER> maanden en jonger dan <NUMBER> jaar te vaccineren de gezinsgenoten van kinderen onder de <NUMBER> maanden voor die jonge leeftijd het vaccin niet geregistreerd kregen ook het advies tot vaccinatie om zo besmetting van die kwetsbare babys te voorkomen twee weken later startten de ggds met het vaccineren van meer dan een miljoen kinderen al deze berichten leidden tot een grote informatiebehoefte bij het publiek en de gezondheidszorgmedewerkers het ministerie coö rdineerde de voorlichting aan het publiek met een huisaanhuisfolder televisiespotjes en een speciale website het rivm verzorgde de voorlichting aan professionals dit gebeurde wat betreft de voorlichting aan huisartsen nauw overleg met de lhv en het nhg beide beroepsorganisaties richtten een website de mexicaanse griep en zorgden ervoor dat alle informatie afgestemd bleef met die van vws en het rivm en voor de vaccinatie met het nationaal programma grieppreventie <NUMBER> tabel <NUMBER> staat als voorbeeld een opsomming van de activiteiten van het nhg zoals vermeld het jaarverslag alle voorlichting werd voortdurend onderzocht op consistentie vooral het geadjuveerde vaccin kwam veel informatie op het web terecht op websites van bijvoorbeeld kritischprikkennl een vragenlijstonderzoek bleek dat de informatie van het rivm en vws door <NUMBER> van de bevolking werd gewaardeerd <NUMBER> de informatie van de ggd werd door <NUMBER> van de ondervraagden betrouwbaar geacht ruim <NUMBER> beoordeelde de informatie van de huisarts als het betrouwbaarst de vaccinatiegraad ondanks al deze wisselende publiciteit niet anders dan tegen de seizoensgriep van de risicopopulatie kreeg <NUMBER> de seizoensprik <NUMBER> minstens één vaccinatie tegen de mexicaanse griep en <NUMBER> zelfs beide vaccinaties <NUMBER> de vaccinatiegraad van de huisarts en het praktijkpersoneel zelf lag op gelijke hoogte <NUMBER> de huisartsenpraktijken gaven de periode oktobernovember totaal <NUMBER> miljoen vaccinaties de ggds haalden de eerste ronde <NUMBER> van de opgeroepen kinderen en de tweede ronde <NUMBER> de percentages liggen aanzienlijk hoger dan andere landen zo werd frankrijk nog geen <NUMBER> gevaccineerd daar werd de huisarts gepasseerd bij de vaccinatie en dat bleek geen goede zet de omvang van de mexicaanse griep bleek uiteindelijk na juist door de vaccinatie mee te vallen zie figuur <NUMBER> het aantal gevallen zoals bijgehouden door de peilstations van het nivel kwam niet boven de normale seizoensgriep uit doordat bij ouderen de ziekte weinig voor kwam bleef de sterfte ver achter bij de normale jaarlijkse mortaliteit door influenza totaal werden <NUMBER> mensen opgenomen een ziekenhuis en stierven <NUMBER> patiënten aan de gevolgen van de mexicaanse griep de discrepantie tussen de uitgebreide voorbereiding en de uiteindelijke omvang van de pandemie heeft wereldwijd geleid tot behoefte aan evaluatie de de raad van europa het europees parlement en vele ministeries van gezondheidszorg startten onderzoek naar het effect van alle maatregelen nederland zal het ministerie van vws voor eind <NUMBER> daarover een rapport uitbrengen een belangrijk aspect de rol die de farmaceutische

crisis van <NUMBER> zijn de vette jaren alleen gebruikt om geld opzij te leggen voor slechte tijden die tijd ook gebruikt om systeemfouten aan te pakken parallellen en verschillen tussen de crisis van <NUMBER> en nu worden de rijken rijker en de armen armer nlangs big short weer eens op televisie de film de weg naar de financiële crisis van <NUMBER> schetst een ontluisterend beeld van de financiële sector de vs en het rotsvaste vertrouwen dat het nooit fout zou kunnen gaan met het stijgen van de huizenprijzen en de groeiende rendementen op kapitaal uiteindelijk leidde de crisis de financiële sector tot een wereldwijde economische crisis en daarmee gepaard gaande massawerkloosheid het terugzien van big short en alle herinneringen aan de economische crisis die daarop volgden riepen de vraag op welke parallellen kunnen trekken tussen toen en nu hoeverre mogen verwachten dat geleerd hebben van de lessen uit de vorige crisis die zich nog zo kortgeleden voltrok die vraag dringt zich des te meer op omdat nederland net als duitsland nog dezelfde regeringsleider aan het roer staat als destijds er zou sprake moeten zijn van enig geheugen omdat groeiende werkloosheid en daarmee inkomensdalingen bij huishoudens zich nu al aankondigen de vraag de vette jaren niet alleen gebruikt zijn om geld opzij te leggen voor slechte tijden maar ook die tijd gebruikt om systeemfouten aan te pakken ik wil hier met name kijken naar de mate waarin het systeem verbeterd het bieden van een minimaal noodzakelijke bestaansen inkomenszekerheid en daar waar dat niet te laat gebeurt het systeem voldoende voorbereid op het voorkomen en helpen oplossen van grote schulden bij huishoudens ik beperk hier even tot mensen loondienst en zzpers vragen bestaanszekerheid en ondersteunen van het mkb <NUMBER> zijn niet minder relevant maar ik heb hier niet de ruimte om ook op die groepen te gaan wellicht een volgende keer de regering doet veel om bedrijven te stimuleren personeel dienst te houden met name de zogenaamde noodmaatregel overbrugging voor werkgelegenheid <NUMBER> die ingericht om de loonkosten van bedrijven tot <NUMBER> procent nemen hierop gericht <NUMBER> het een maatregel die vooral helpt te voorkomen dat bedrijven direct omvallen en daarmee dat de werken bestaanszekerheid van hun werknemers wegvalt dat dit op korte termijn helpt leert een snelle vergelijking tussen nederland en de vs de toename van het aantal wwaanvragen nederland nog beperkt tot enkele tienduizenden de vs zijn een kleine twee maanden ruim <NUMBER> miljoen aanvragen voor werkloosheidsuitkeringen geregistreerd percentage van de beroepsbevolking <NUMBER> versus ruim <NUMBER> procent de maatregel na de eerste drie maanden recentelijk verlengd om massawerkloosheid en inkomensterugval op ongekende schaal te voorkomen daarbij moet aangetekend worden dat het ontslagverbod voor bedrijven die een beroep doen op de komen te vervallen de nabije toekomst zal leren welke effecten dat heeft op de werkloosheidsontwikkeling en daarmee op de bestaanszekerheid van veel huishoudens ook bedrijven die slechts gedeeltelijk kunnen herstarten zoals de horeca en het toerisme zullen gecompenseerd moeten blijven worden opdat ze niet omvallen alternatief dat deze bedrijven een faillissement aanvragen de maatschappelijke kosten daarvan zullen nog hoger zijn de tweede noodmaatregel de tozo tijdelijke overbruggingsregeling zelfstandig ondernemers deze regeling moet een vangnet bieden aan zelfstandig ondernemers onder wie zzpers wanneer zij aannemelijk kunnen maken dat zij met hun inkomen uit onderneming als gevolg van de coronacrisis onder het sociaal minimum terecht zijn gekomen kunnen zij via de gemeente een inkomensaanvulling ontvangen tot aan dat sociaal minimum de vermogensen partnertoetsen die normaal gelden wanneer mensen een beroep doen op het besluit bijstandsverlening zelfstandigen bbz zijn tot <NUMBER> juni niet van toepassing de tweede tozoperiode zijn de regels inmiddelsinkomen sociaalbestek juni <NUMBER> <NUMBER> aangepast de partnertoets wordt van toepassing doel om de grote groep zzpers die werkzaam zijn onder andere de cultuursector de evenementenbranche de horeca de fitnessen sportsector en op iets langere termijn de bouw en de landen tuinbouw <NUMBER> niet door het financiële ijs te laten zakken dit bij de nieuwe voorwaarden nog gaat gebeuren moet overigens betwijfeld worden de kernvraag hier huishoudens met een vast inkomen en een weggevallen zzpinkomen de vaste lasten nog wel kunnen betalen zo niet dan dreigen betalingsachterstanden op vrij forse schaal voor deze groep deze maatregelen zullen sommige sectoren net zo lang gecontinueerd moeten worden totdat de beperkingen op contact het kader van de anderhalvemetersamenleving grotendeels zijn opgeheven veel van de genoemde sectoren kunnen niet rendabel opereren met <NUMBER> tot <NUMBER> procent van de klanten de enige sector die ik tot nu toe voorbij heb zien komen die suggereert dat het wellicht mogelijk die van de fitnessbedrijven en juist die moet vooralsnog dicht blijven tot <NUMBER> september naast directe inkomensmaatregelen ook een aantal indirectere maatregelen getroffen zo al vrij snel steun toegezegd aan de voedselbanken die last hadden van het kortdurendehamsteren door die groepen die zich dat konden permitteren daarnaast kregen voedselbanken al heel kort na het afkondigen van de intelligente lockdown te maken met een snel groeiende vraag met hulp van de overheid en aanvullende financiering van een aantal fondsen konden zij deze vraag vooralsnog opvangen hoeverre dat op de korte en de lange termijn voldoende zal zijn nog niet duidelijk vanuit maatschappelijke fondsen vermogensfondsen en de sociale basis wordt verder veel gedaan om kwetsbare huishoudens te ondersteunen met bijvoorbeeld maaltijden die zij de oude situatie tegen een zeer beperkte vergoeding buurthuizen en dergelijke konden eten afhalen ten slotte sneltreinvaart voorzien additionele dagen nachtopvang voor daken thuislozen om te voorkomen dat deze groep gedwongen de openbare ruimte moet verblijven ten aanzien van deze maatregelen mogen wellicht rijkarm voor de een het park een plek om te recreëren de ander vindt er zijn nachtelijke slaapplaats ook bedrijven die slechts gedeeltelijk kunnen herstarten zullen gecompenseerd moeten blijven worden opdat ze niet omvallen inkomen sociaalbestek juni <NUMBER> <NUMBER> hopen dat een groot deel ervan overeind blijft na afloop van de coronacrisis de noodmaatregelen lijken op het eerste gezicht wanneer ze lang genoeg geldig blijven redelijk te passen bij de huidige situatie toch vallen er wel een paar kanttekeningen bij te maken maar eerst wil ik even kijken naar de maatregelen die getroffen zijn het kader van de preventie en het voorkomen van betalingsachterstanden en schulden al heel snel na het afkondigen van de eerste coronamaatregelen duidelijk dat grote groepen nederlanders niet alleen een forse inkomensachteruitgang zouden gaan ervaren zij zullen als gevolg daarvan ook niet aan hun lopende verplichtingen kunnen voldoen betalingsachterstanden zullen ontstaan wanneer mensen een fors deel van hun inkomen verliezen veel jongeren hebben hun inkomen al helemaal zien wegvallen zij hebben op zn best drie maanden recht op een kortdurende wwuitkering maar ook anderen zullen betalingsachterstanden moeten laten ontstaan omdat de verplichtingen niet snel kunnen worden teruggeschroefd zorgverzekering huur energie water verzekeringen mobiele abonnementen et cetera tot slot er een vraag die de afgelopen tien jaar regelmatig gesteld maar nooit beantwoord de vorm van een aanpassing van het systeem er niet nagedacht een algemene inkomensof bestaanszekerheidsgarantie al dan niet de vorm van een basisinkomen mensen zullen dus bij overgang van de ene inkomstenbron werk naar andere inkomstenbronnen uitkeringen nog steeds geconfronteerd worden met weken langer zonder inkomen een dergelijke garantie de vorm aanneemt van een onvoorwaardelijk basisinkomen een garantie via de belastingdienst een negatieve inkomstenbelasting zoals de earned income tax credit uit de vs niet zo belangrijk belangrijk dat moeten constateren dat er niet nagedacht en dat zon garantie er dus niet het verlengde daarvan het systeem van toeslagen dat inkomensdalingen voor een deel zou kunnen opvangen niet vereenvoudigd en de uitvoering ervan niet gemoderniseerd ook andere oplossingen zijn niet beeld gekomen zoals het verschuiven van belastingen van arbeid naar arbeidsloos inkomen winst dividend erfenissen en dergelijke het risico daarmee levensgroot dat na deze crisis de rijksten wederom veel rijker zijn geworden en de armen nog armer de eerste bewijzen zijn daarvoor inmiddels aanwezig

tot voor enkele jaren geleden bestond er slechts een beperkte voorziening voor het overplaatsen van icbehoeftige kinderen naar een picu het interklinisch transport werd veelal verzorgd door de insturend kinderarts sommige gevallen door een anesthesioloog van het insturend ziekenhuis deze persoon de meeste gevallen weinig tot geen ervaring met het transport van ernstig zieke gewonde kinderen <NUMBER> daarnaast beschikte men tijdens het transport niet onvoldoende de juiste apparatuur uit nederlands onderzoek bleek dan ook dat het voor het kind beter als het interklinisch transport plaats zou vinden door een transportteam van de picu waar het kind zou worden opgenomen <NUMBER> op grond van deze gegevens heeft de sectie intensive care kinderen van de nederlandse vereniging voor kindergeneeskunde een notitie opgesteld waarin de zorg voor ernstig zieke gewonde kinderen werd besproken <NUMBER> deze notitie volgde op een beleidsnotitie met een soortgelijke strekking opgesteld door de inspectie voor de gezondheidszorg <NUMBER> beide notities werd gesproken het transport van ernstig zieke gewonde kinderen naar een picu dit leidde onder andere tot de afspraak om <NUMBER> een landelijk dekkend transportsysteem functionerend te hebben uit diverse onderzoeken uitgevoerd australie¨ het verenigd koninkrijk en de verenigde staten blijkt dat de kwaliteit van zorg tijdens een

ernstig zieke gewonde kinderen evenals kennis van het voortschrijden van het ziekteproces beyond golden hour ten tweede het gebruik van de trolley met eigen materialen en als derde een veel lagere

zieke gewonde geıntubeerde kinderen bij patie¨nten bij wie geen noodzaak tot endotracheale intubatie bestaat wordt het transport door het insturende ziekenhuis verzorgd het voordeel van het <NUMBER>uurssysteem dat insturend artsen niet meer hoeven te zoeken naar een beschikbaar picubed als zij een patie¨nt willen plaatsen naar hun regionale picu wordt contact gezocht en wordt de overname gerealiseerd het geval van een niet te realiseren opname zorgt het regionale centrum voor opname op een andere picu inclusief het transport naar deze afdeling vanwege de centralisatie van picubedden worden ernstig zieke gewonde kinderen lange afstand getransporteerd uit diverse onderzoeken echter gebleken dat dit geen bezwaar hoeft te zijn mits aan een aantal randvoorwaarden voldaan deze randvoorwaarden zijn primaire opvang en stabilisatie door verwijzend arts de insturende specialist blijft verantwoordelijk voor de primaire opvang van ernstig zieke gewonde kinderen toenemende mate hebben kinderartsen maar ook anesthesiologen en sehartsen van perifere ziekenhuizen met succes deelgenomen aan de advanced pediatric life support aplscursussen waarin de opvang van ernstig zieke gewonde kinderen op gestructureerde wijze eigen wordt gemaakt de insturende specialist heeft telefonisch overleg met de dienstdoende kinderartsintensivist de conditie van het kind en de indicatie tot endotracheale intubatie daarnaast kan de dienstdoende kinderartsintensivist adviezen geven omtrent de verdere stabilisatie van het kind het kind zal volgens de abcmethodiek gestabiliseerd worden de veiligheid van het transport net als de outcome van de patie¨nt wordt voor een groot deel bepaald door de kwaliteit van primaire opvang en stabilisatie het picutransportteam bestaat uit een
