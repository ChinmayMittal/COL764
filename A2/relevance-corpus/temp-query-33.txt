hypothetically, almost all proteins of the miniature organism (viruses) are potential vaccine 116 targets (shi et al., 2015) . in an incredibly fast piece of study, it has been shown that once this 117 virus installed itself into the human body, it encodes its "tool proteins" which helps in the 118 replication. these "tool proteins" i.e. non-structural proteins are the key (toolkit) to 119 synthesize the other structural proteins (spike, membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid) and 120 factors which requires to grow its progeny (lewis et al., 2020) . in our strategy of vaccine 121 development, we have engineered the toolkit i.e. non-structural proteins which includes 3-c 122 like proteinase (yp_009725301.1), rna dependent rna polymerase (yp_009725307.1), 123 helicase (yp_009725308.1), 3'-5' exonuclease (yp_009725309.1), 2'-o-ribo methyl 124 transferase (yp_009725311.1) & endornase (yp_009725310.1). all these proteins have 125 also used as a drug target for commercially available antiviral drugs to fight against sudden 126 outbreak of covid-19, since there are no specific antivirals available (beck et al., 2020) . 127 further, several non-structural proteins make the replicase-transcriptase complex, which 128 ultimately helps in the replication and transcription of virus genomic rna (ziebuhr, 2005) .the 3-c like proteinase is a protease present in all coronaviruses, which helps in proteolysis 130 of the non-structural protein 5 (nsp5) during replication process of virus (tomar et al., 2015) .this makes it a high value vaccine candidate against the coronavirus. further, a key enzyme 132 of coronavirus replication and transcription system is rna-dependent rna polymerase 133 (rdrp), which is encoded by nsp12, also appears as an attractive target for therapeutics (gao prediction of cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctl) epitopes for vaccine designing 185 the ctl epitopes for vaccine designing were predicted by using netctl 1.2 server 186 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netctl/). this server comprises of two datasets, one is of 187 hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) ctl epitopes and other one is their source proteins.the proteins present in the datasets have been cleaved into all probable 9 mers. the exception 189 was only for the annotated epitopes and the remaining ones are considered as non-epitopes.the protein sequences in fasta has been required as input for the prediction of potential apart from this, the average antigenic propensity of the designed vaccine candidate was grand average of hydropathicity (gravy) 0.060 candidate was probably non-allergen and will not lead to any allergy during pre and post 454 vaccination. subsequently, with the help of toxinpred server we have checked the toxicity of 455 the epitopes, as this server accepts the protein sequences of >500 amino acids and here, in 456 this study the designed vaccine candidate was of 561 amino acid. so, after doing this it was 457 found that all the epitopes involved in the designing of vaccine candidate was non-toxic and 458 will not release any toxic components after administration (supplementary table-5a, 5b and   459 5c). this above data suggested that the designed vaccine candidate was highly stable, raptorx server.tertiary structure refinement and validation 485 the tertiary structure refinement was achieved with the help of 3d refine server. as an output 486 the server generated five refined models and the selection of best model was done on the 487 basis of various parameters. the model number fifth was selected as its 3d refine score was 488 40460.5 which was less than all the other four models. additionally, the gdt-ts score of the 489 selected model was 0.9960 whereas the gdt-ha score was 0.9501, these higher scores 490 denotes the conservative refinement. next, the rmsd (root mean square deviation) was 491 0.450, this higher score indicates the aggressive refinement in comparison to initial non-492 refined one. the molprobity score was 3.790 and the rwplus (potential energy) score was - the score obtained by qmean4 server was -7.25 whereas the global iddt score of the 501 model was 0.9182 (this score should be ranges between 0 and 1). next, with the help of 502 qmeandisco scoring function we have predicted the global quality of model, the obtained 503 global score was 0.35 ± 0.05. this data suggested that the score (global, local, iddt) 504 obtained for our model structure was higher and in between the range, hence, we can 505 conclude that designed model has best scoring and was of exceptional quality (figure-4) . reported that mice lacking tlr3 and tlr4 are more vulnerable to sars-cov in 540 comparison to mice having tlr3 and tlr4 receptors; exceptionally weight loss was 541 observed when exposed to infection, but no mortality was detected (totura et al., 2015) . one immune receptor tlr-3 using haddock server. the immune simulation experiment was performed using c-immsim server which, gives a 595 real immune response result. in our results, we have observed the proliferation in secondary 596 and tertian immune response which is identified by igg1 + igg2 and igm. also, while 597 decreasing the antigen count igg + igm also showed the proliferated response in figure 8 a.result revealed the immune response development upon immunization. b-cell population 599 level was also stimulated and seems to be very high upon immunization (figure 8 b) . sars-cov-2. four of them (hcov-hku1, hcov-oc43, hcov-229e, and hcov-nl63) have 46 been circulating in the human population worldwide and cause mild symptoms 2 . coronavirus 47 and m protein can be delivered as recombinant dna vaccine and viral vector vaccine (table 2) conservation suggested the potential of n protein as a candidate for the cross-protective vaccine 119 against sars and mers. the n protein was also evaluated and used for vaccine development 120 (table 2 ). the n protein packs the coronavirus rna to form the helical nucleocapsid in virion 121 assembly. this protein is more conserved than the s protein and was reported to induce an 122 immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections 20 . however, a study also showed the 123 linkage between n protein and severe pneumonia or other serious liver failures related to the 124 pathogenesis of sars 21 . 125the vaxign-ml pipeline computed the protegenicity (protective antigenicity) score and 139 predicted the induction of protective immunity by a vaccine candidate 16 . the training data 140 consisted of viral protective antigens, which were tested to be protective in at least one animal 141 challenge model 27 . the performance of the vaxign-ml models was evaluated (table s1 and 142 figure s1 ), and the best performing model had a weighted f1-score of 0.94. using the optimized 143 vaxign-ml model, we predicted three proteins (s protein, nsp3, and nsp8) as vaccine candidates 144 with significant protegenicity scores ( 26 . therefore, we selected nsp3 for further investigation, as described 150 below. 151the multiple sequence alignment and the resulting phylogeny of nsp3 protein showed that 154 this protein in sars-cov-2 was more closely related to the human coronaviruses sars-cov and 155 mers-cov, and bat coronaviruses btcov/hku3, btcov/hku4, and btcov/hku9. we studied 156 the genetic conservation of nsp3 protein ( figure 1a ) in seven human coronaviruses and eight 157 coronaviruses infecting other animals (table s2 ). the five human coronaviruses, sars-cov-2, 158 sars-cov, mers-cov, hcov-hku1, and hcov-oc43, belong to the beta-coronavirus while 159hcov-229e and hcov-nl63 belong to the alpha-coronavirus. the hcov-hku1 and hcov-160 oc43, as the human coronavirus with mild symptoms clustered together with murine mhv-a59. 161the more severe form of human coronavirus sars-cov-2, sars-cov, and mers-cov grouped 162 with three bat coronaviruses btcov/hku3, btcov/hku4, and btcov/hku9. 163when evaluating the amino acid conservations relative to the functional domains in nsp3, 164 all protein domains, except the hypervariable region (hvr), macro-domain 1 (mac1) and beta-165 coronavirus-specific marker βsm, showed higher conservation in sars-cov-2, sars-cov, and 7 used to generate the phylogenetic of nsp3 protein ( figure 1b) . the sars-cov domains were also 169 plotted ( figure 1b) , with the relative position in the multiple sequence alignment (msa) of all 15 170 coronaviruses (table s3 and figure s2 ). 171the immunogenicity of nsp3 protein in terms of t cell mhc-i & mhc-ii and linear b cell 172 epitopes was also investigated. there were 28 and 42 promiscuous epitopes predicted to bind the 173 reference mhc-i & mhc-ii alleles, which covered the majority of the world population, 174 respectively (table s4 -5). in terms of linear b cell epitopes, there were 14 epitopes with bepipred 175 scores over 0.55 and had at least ten amino acids in length (table s6 ). the 3d structure of sars- (table 2 ). but the inactivated or attenuated whole virus vaccine might induce strong 8 immune response 20, 29, 30 . in some studies, these structural proteins, including the s and n proteins, 200were reported to associate with the pathogenesis of coronavirus 21,31 and might raise safety concern. 201 a study has shown increased liver pathology in the vaccinated ferrets immunized with modified 202 vaccinia ankara-s recombinant vaccine 32 . although there were no other adverse events reported 203 in other animal studies, the safety and efficacy of these vaccination strategies has not been tested 204 in human clinical trials. our study applied the state-of-the-art vaxign reserve vaccinology (rv) 205and vaxign-ml machine learning strategies to the entire sars-cov-2 proteomes including both 206 structural and non-structural proteins for vaccine candidate prediction. our results indicate for the 207 first time that many non-structural proteins could be used as potential vaccine candidates. 208the sars-cov-2 s protein was identified by our vaxign and vaxign-ml analysis as the 209 most favorable vaccine candidate. first, the vaxign rv framework predicted the s protein as a 210 likely adhesin, which is consistent with the role of s protein for the invasion of host cells. second, 211our vaxign-ml predicted that the s protein had a high protective antigenicity score. these results 212 confirmed the role of s protein as the important target of covid-19 vaccines. however, the s 213 protein exists in many coronaviruses, and many non-pathogenic human coronaviruses also use s 214 protein to cell invasion. for example, despite markedly weak pathogenicity, hcov-nl63 also 215 uses s protein and employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) for cellular entry 33 . this 216 suggests that the s protein is not the only factor determining the infection level of a human 217 coronavirus. in addition, targeting only the s protein may induce high serum-neutralizing antibody 218 titers but cannot induce sufficient protective efficacy 34 . thus, alternative vaccine antigens may be 219 considered. 220the sars-cov-2 nsp3 protein was predicted to be a potential vaccine candidate, as shown 221 by its predicted second-highest protective antigenicity score, adhesin property, promiscuous 222 of the viral structural particle, and none of the non-structural proteins have been evaluated as 232 vaccine candidates. the sars/mers/covid-19 vaccine studies so far target the structural 233 (s/m/n) proteins. still, the non-structural proteins have been used effective vaccine antigens to 234 stimulate protective immunity against many viruses. for example, the non-structural protein ns1 235 was found to induce protective immunity against the infections by flaviviruses 35 . the non-236 structural proteins of the hepatitis c virus were reported to induce hcv-specific vigorous and 237 broad-spectrum t-cell responses 36 . the non-structural hiv-1 gene products were also shown to 238 be valuable targets for prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines 37 . therefore, it is reasonable to 239 consider the sars-cov-2 non-structural proteins as possible vaccine targets, as suggested by the 240 present study. 241instead of using a single protein as the vaccine antigen, we would like to propose the 242 development of a "cocktail vaccine" as an effective strategy for covid-19 vaccine development. 243a typical cocktail vaccine includes more than one antigen to cover different aspects of 244 protection 39,40 . the licensed group b meningococcus bexsero vaccine, which was developed via 245 reverse vaccinology, contains three protein antigens 9 . to develop an efficient and safe covid-19 246 cocktail vaccine, it is possible to mix the structural (e.g., s protein) and non-structural (e.g., nsp3) 247 viral proteins. the other proteins identified in our study may also be considered as possible vaccine 248 targets. the benefit of a cocktail vaccine strategy could induce immunity that can protect the host 249 against not only the s-ace2 interaction and viral entry to the host cells, but also protect against 250 the accessary non-structural adhesin proteins (e.g., nsp3), which might also be vital to the viral 251 entry and replication. the usage of more than one antigen allows us to reduce the volume of each 252 antigen and thus reducing the induction of adverse events. nonetheless, the potentials of these 253 performance of these models was evaluated using a nested five-fold cross-validation (n5cv) 294 based on the area under receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, weighted f1-295 score, and matthew's correlation coefficient. the best performing xgb model was selected to 296 predict the protegenicity score of all sars-cov-2 isolate wuhan-hu-1 (genbank id: 297 mn908947.3) proteins, downloaded from ncbi. a protein with protegenicity score over 0.9 is 298 considered as strong vaccine immunity induction (weighted f1-score > 0.94 in n5cv). 299 300 phylogenetic analysis. the protein nsp3 was selected for further investigation. the nsp3 proteins 301 of 14 coronaviruses besides sars-cov-2 were downloaded from the uniprot (table s2 ). multiple 302 sequence alignment of these nsp3 proteins was performed using muscle 59 and visualized via 303 seaview 60 . the phylogenetic tree was constructed using phyml 61 , and the amino acid 304 conservation was estimated by the jensen-shannon divergence (jsd) 62 . the jsd score was also 305 used to generate a sequence conservation line using the nsp3 protein sequences from 4 or 13 306 coronaviruses. 307 308 immunogenicity analysis. the immunogenicity of the nsp3 protein was evaluated by the 309 prediction of t cell mhc-i and mhc-ii, and linear b cell epitopes. for t cell mhc-i epitopes, 310 the iedb consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 4 out of 27 311 mhc-i reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 1.0 score 50 . for t cell mhc-312 ii epitopes, the iedb consensus method was used to predicting promiscuous epitopes binding to 313 more than half of the 27 mhc-ii reference alleles with consensus percentile ranking less than 10.0. 314the mhc-i and mhc-ii reference alleles covered a wide range of human genetic variation 315 representing the majority of the world population 63,64 . the linear b cell epitopes were predicted 316 using the bepipred 2.0 with a cutoff of 0.55 score 65 . linear b cell epitopes with at least ten amino 317 acids were mapped to the predicted 3d structure of sars-cov-2 nsp3 protein visualized via 318 pymol 66 . the predicted count of t cell mhc-i and mhc-ii epitopes, and the predicted score of 319 linear b cell epitopes were computed as the sliding averages with a window size of ten amino acids. 320the nsp3 protein 3d structure was predicted using c-i- tasser to better understand the current status of coronavirus vaccine development, we 94 systematically surveyed the development of vaccines for coronavirus from the clinicaltrials.gov 95 database and pubmed literature (as of march 17, 2020). extensive effort has been made to 96 develop a safe and effective vaccine against sars or mers, and the most advance clinical trial 97 study is currently at phase ii (table 1) . it is a challenging task to quickly develop a safe and 98 effective vaccine for the on-going covid-19 pandemic. 99there are two primary design strategies for coronavirus vaccine development: the usage 100 to improve vaccine safety and efficacy. the coronavirus antigens such as s protein, n protein, and m protein can be delivered as recombinant dna vaccine and viral vector vaccine (table 2) conservation suggested the potential of n protein as a candidate for the cross-protective vaccine 119 against sars and mers. the n protein was also evaluated and used for vaccine development 120 (table 2 ). the n protein packs the coronavirus rna to form the helical nucleocapsid in virion 121 assembly. this protein is more conserved than the s protein and was reported to induce an 122 immune response and neutralize coronavirus infections 20 . however, a study also showed the 123 linkage between n protein and severe pneumonia or other serious liver failures related to the 124 pathogenesis of sars 21 . 125the vaxign-ml pipeline computed the protegenicity (protective antigenicity) score and 139 predicted the induction of protective immunity by a vaccine candidate 16 . the training data 140 consisted of viral protective antigens, which

preprintcoronavirus disease 2019 is caused by the novel beta-coronavirus family member coined sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) (oberfeld et al., 2020) . in december 2019 (and potentially earlier, though unrecognized), sars-cov-2 emerged as a pneumonia-causing disorder in hubei province, china, most likely the result of natural selection in animal hosts (bats, pangolins) prior to zoonotic transfer (andersen et al., 2020; wu et al., 2020a; zhu n. et al., 2020) . there are now seven members of this viral family known to infect humans with three having the potential to cause severe respiratory disease (andersen et al., 2020) . the two outbreaks preceding sars-cov-2 include the first sars virus emerging in late 2002 in guangdong province in china (now referred to as sars-cov-1), followed by the middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) in 2012 in saudi arabia (de wit et al., 2016) . sars-cov-2 has rampaged exponentially around the world since the start of 2020; the world health organization (who) declared it a public health emergency of international concern on january 30, 2020 and a pandemic officially on march 7, 2020 (sohrabi et al., 2020) . at the time of revision of this review (june 7, 2020) , infections are at 7 million individuals in at least 195 countries with ≈400,000 in the mortality column 1 . collateral damage to global economies and many professional business and recreational sectors (travel, hospitality/tourism, sport, etc.) is ongoing and widespread due to governmentally imposed lockdowns.the virus spreads primarily from respiratory droplets of infected individuals ( figure 1 ) in enclosed spaces, and to a much lesser extent by fomites, to mucosal epithelial cells in the upper airway and oral cavity (pambuccian, 2020) . here, the virus uses its trimeric spike protein to latch onto host cell ace2 (angiotensinconverting enzyme-2) receptor binding sites (figure 1 ), via the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of this glycoprotein in the "prefusion" state (cyranoski, 2020; walls et al., 2020; wrapp et al., 2020; yuan et al., 2020) . proteases such as tmprss-2/furin cleave viral spike (figure 1 ) to enable membranes of the virus and host cell to fuse (hoffmann et al., 2020; oberfeld et al., 2020) . the virus enters cells by endocytosis. the 30 kb single-stranded plus-strand rna is released directly into the cytoplasm and hijacks the cell to translate the viral replication-transcription complex (rtc) in a double membrane vesicle. the rtc then produces rnas that translate into protein, the orfs coding for 16 nonstructural proteins, four main structural proteins and other special proteins (oberfeld et al., 2020) . virions are assembled with rna encased by nucleocapsid (n) and a "coat" consisting of membrane (m), envelope (e) and spike (s) proteins. once released, the viral particles can infect cells in the lower airways (type ii pneumocytes) and enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract lamers et al., 2020) .clinical symptoms of infection, although highly variable, are fever, dry and persistent cough, fatigue, anosomia/dysgeusia, loss of appetite and dyspnea but a plethora of other signs may, or may not, be present (e.g. headaches, sore throat, myalgia, rigors, intestinal discomfort/diarrhea, ocular manifestations, etc) oberfeld et al., 2020; vetter et al., 2020) . severe symptoms leading to hospitalization that progress rapidly to hypoxia and respiratory distress requiring supplemental oxygen and ventilator support are most prevalent in the elderly with underlying comorbidities . however, an unusual presentation in children, similar to kawasaki disease, termed mis-c (multisystem inflammatory disease in children) is emerging (viner and whittaker, 2020) . why many viral-positive individuals are asymptomatic, or exhibit only minor cold symptoms, remains incompletely understood. increasingly clear is the multifocal nature of covid-19 pathogenesis with sars-cov-2 sometimes instigating destruction to blood vessel endothelial cells leading to coagulopathy and strokes, as well as potential kidney and neurological problems (sardu et al., 2020) . blood sampling in moderate-severe cases may reveal lymphocytopenia, elevation of inflammatory markers like creactive protein (crp) and the cytokine interleukin 6 (il-6), along with a pro-coagulant state exhibiting elevated d-dimer (a fibrin-degradation product), indicative of an immune response out of control called a cytokine storm (chen g. et al., 2020) . there are no therapies or preventative vaccines for our immune naïve global population. hundreds of existing drugs and a common vaccine, repurposed for covid-19, are undergoing clinical trials. the existing vaccine being studied in the netherlands and australia is for tuberculosis. bcg (bacille calmette-gueŕin) has previously shown mixed, but broadly protective, effects against a variety of respiratory infectious diseases (o'neill and netea, 2020) . the early hype revolved around (hydroxy)chloroquine (malaria, autoimmune indications with antiviral properties) but the drug appears to offer minimal benefit for covid-19 resolution, with the potential for harm, and some clinical trials have been shut down (ferner and aronson, 2020; tang et al., 2020) . remdesivir, an antiviral drug currently under fda emergency use authorization (eua), has shown modest benefit reducing symptoms and recovery by approximately 4 days in one study 2 but no effect in another . tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-human il-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, may be effective at rendering the cytokine storminducing effects of il-6 less capable of initiating damage to the airways but more studies are required 3 . interferon (ifn)-a2b is looking promising as early results suggest it reduces viral load in the upper airways and can reduce crp and il-6 (zhou q. et al., 2020) . drug therapy aside, a major step forward in this current pandemic is the generation of a safe and effective preventative vaccine. several articles have already appeared on this topic (ahn et al., 2020; amanat and krammer, 2020; caddy, 2020; callaway, 2020a; cohen, 2020; kim et al., 2020; lurie et al., 2020; wang f. et al., 2020; wu, 2020) . this article deals with a late may 2020 snapshot of the global race for a sars-cov-2 vaccine that is taking place at breakneck speed, with a brief prelude on diagnostics and history of vaccines.knowing the genetic makeup of sars-cov-2 is essential for covid-19 diagnostics. the 30 kb sars-cov-2 genome sequence analysis of a patient isolate from wuhan at the epicenter in china, published in early january 2020, took place swiftly after viral isolation . from january-may 2020, the genome has been sequenced a multitude of times in clinical isolates obtained from patients around the world (mavian et al., 2020) . the sars-cov-2 genome is about 80% similar to that of sars-cov-1 and 50% to mers-cov but 96% to a bat coronavirus (andersen et al., 2020; .since deciphering the original sequence, some genetic drift is occurring in worldwide cases with mutations even arising in the spike-encoding region, the key gateway to host entry, which could be altering virulence (becerra-flores and cardozo, 2020). besides the four structural proteins of sars-cov-2 mentioned above (s, e, m, n), and the critical rtc, there are several additional open-reading frames (orfs) encoding nonstructural proteins and a viral protease within the sars-cov-2 genome, some with clear functions deduced from prior study with sars-cov-1 but others with unknown function (ahn et al., 2020) . interestingly, orf3b appears to suppress strongly the important type i cytokine host immune response by blocking interferon (konno et al., 2020) .reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) is the hallmark laboratory diagnostic technology to detect viral nucleic acid obtained from nasal swabs. each jurisdiction around the world has designated screening assays using primer sets from either n, e, rna-dependent rna polymerase, orf1a or orf1b sequences (ahn et al., 2020) . reliable covid-19 diagnostic tests to detect individuals exposed to the virus is of paramount importance. many asymptomatic infected people and those that have recovered from covid-19 should carry immunity to further infection (danchin and timmis, 2020) . this includes the production of neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov-2 . the hunt is on for rapid detection assays for those immune-privileged individuals. our colleagues have carried out detailed analyses of over 300 viral antigen/serological antibody tests seeking approval (or already with eua) for this important area (ghaffari et al., 2020) . figure 1 | transmission and life-cycle of sars-cov-2 causing covid-19. sars-cov-2 is transmitted via respiratory droplets of infected cases to oral and respiratory mucosal cells. the virus, possessing a single-stranded rna genome wrapped in nucleocapsid (n) protein and three major surface proteins: membrane (m), envelope (e) and spike, replicates and passes to the lower airways potentially leading to severe pneumonia. the gateway to host cell entry (magnified view) is via spike-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) interaction with cleavage of spike in the prefusion state by proteases tmprss-2/furin. a simplified depiction of the life cycle of the virus is shown along with potential immune responses elicited.generating the "ideal" vaccine for protection against covid-19vaccines are one of the monumental achievements in human medical intervention to mitigate the dispersion and impact of infectious disease. polio was a serious crippling disorder for decades until the development of two separate vaccine candidates by jonas salk and albert sabin (melnick, 1996) . from the time of the first polio outbreak in the united states to testing and development was almost 60 years 4 ( figure 2 ). more recently, a vaccine for the lethal infectious hemorrhagic fever elicited by ebola disease took on a substantially different timeline with development by a canadian team (jones et al., 2005) preceding the worst outbreak in western africa in 2014, with the disease first described in isolated cases in 1976. taking into account the prolonged development and testing phases it still took at least 15 years ( figure 2 ) for authorized clinical use of an ebola vaccine 5 . looking at the other coronavirus diseasecausing outbreaks (sars and mers) that led to regional epidemics in various countries, the impetus was strong initially to develop vaccines but fizzled out with their spontaneous resolution. although vaccine candidates were brought forward for both sars-cov-1 and mers, and projects continue, there are still no approved vaccines for either infectious agent 17 and 6 years, respectively (de wit et al., 2016; song et al., 2019) , since the original outbreaks ( figure 2 ). in view of this, the bar is set high for developing an effective vaccine targeting covid-19. will sars-cov-2 go the same direction as the other coronaviruses, or will it become a seasonal outbreak like influenza and persist as a moderately benign to severe nuisance-causing infectious disorder that lasts for years?given the worldwide magnitude of the covid-19 pandemic and comparisons to the great spanish flu of 1918, the race for a vaccine candidate has taken on unprecedented urgency and commitment across the globe. established organizations are maintaining databases of vaccines under development including the world health organization 6 (who), the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations 7 (cepi), the milken institute 8 (a nonprofit think-tank out of california), and biocentury inc 9 (a partner to the biopharmaceutical industry). unparalleled data sharing and collaborative team efforts are breaking down barriers in an attempt to reduce the time from the usual 10 + years for an approved vaccine down to 12-18 months. cepi, the biomedical advanced research and development authority 10 (barda), gavi, the vaccine alliance 11 (formerly global alliance for vaccines and immunization), various governments and other sources are either pouring money into the efforts to fund projects or providing logistical support with additional initiatives. one such initiative is the strategic alliance activ 12 (accelerating covid-19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines), a publicprivate initiative bringing together more than a dozen leading biopharmaceutical companies, the cdc (centers for disease control and prevention), fda (u.s. food and drug administration), and ema (european medicines agency) to develop an international strategy for a coordinated research response to the covid-19 pandemic. another massive undertaking to expedite the process is operation warp speed 13 , which includes scientists, pharmaceutical companies and us federal officials and is being compared to the manhattan project 14 what does the "ideal" vaccine look like for covid-19 prevention? in clinical terms, three main factors are essential: (i) a robust immune response generating long-lasting neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov-2 antigens (e.g. s and/ or n) is imperative (figures 1 and 3) . when individuals are infected with foreign antigens on viruses, they evoke both innate and adaptive immune reactions with a coordinated antigen-presenting cell (apc) attack on the virus and thelper cell activation that leads to b-lymphocytes producing antibodies. in this context, ideally the antibodies will directly interfere with sars-cov-2's knack for latching onto epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes via ace2 ( figure 1 ) in order to neutralize the virus. this would curtail successfully the virus from infecting the host and be protective if an infection resulted. however, there remains critical shortfalls in the current knowledge of what comprises a protective immune response against covid-19 and how long it lasts [as of may 2020]. (ii) the ideal sars-cov-2 vaccine will also induce potent t-lymphocyte immunity. ideally, this would be a well-coordinated, orchestrated t-cell response that includes t-helper and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte subsets that recognize sars-cov-2 infected cells in the body and annihilate them to block viral replication, along with acquisition of memory t-cells to prevent reinfection months to years later. (iii) the candidate vaccine should limit any serious adverse events (saes) at the injection site or systemically, for example, fever in infants and young children. in the case of respiratory disorders caused by infectious agents, it is essential that vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (vaerd), antibody-dependent en hanc emen t (ade), a n tibo dy -depende nt ce llular cytotoxicity (adcc), complement-dependent cytotoxicity, including cytokine storm-inducing effects are completely avoided (graham, 2020; hotez et al., 2020; vardhana and wolchok, 2020) . some of these clinical sequelae have been associated with past vaccines in development (figure 3) , with a prominent example that for respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) during the late 1960s (graham, 2020) . since the virus apparently activates complement deposition in small blood vessels of some infected individuals (magro et al., 2020) , blocking adverse host responses is essential. complement, inflammation, and coagulation systems are intertwined (oikonomopoulou et al., 2012) and hyperactive in covid-19 positive cases and the vaccine should not provoke these host response systems.in logistical terms, there are a few essential parameters for the ideal candidate vaccine for covid-19: (i) the vaccine should be easy to administer and preferably in a single dose at the lowest possible amount. an oral or intranasal vaccine would be ideal.(ii) the vaccine should be facile to produce and scale-up. manufacturing millions to billions of doses required to immunize the human population must be feasible and rapid. (iii) long-term storage of the vaccine at room temperature should be a sought after goal to facilitate transport and stockpiling in underdeveloped nations with inadequate supply chains and cold chain capacities (figure 3) . the ideal vaccine targeting covid-19 would fit into a proposed target product profile as described in table 1 .the normal strides taken to achieve successful vaccine development are similar to those for any drug. the process should be very stringent seeing that it will culminate in administration of the vaccine candidate to billions of humans. the typical paradigm is depicted in figure 3 and is explained in the legend.the scientific publications to date (ahn et al., 2020; amanat and krammer, 2020; caddy, 2020; callaway, 2020a; callaway, 2020b; cohen, 2020; chen wh et al., 2020; kim et al., 2020; lurie et al., 2020; thanh le et al., 2020; wang f et al., 2020; wu, 2020) , as well as databases mentioned above, have various formats for classifying vaccine platforms. in our analysis, we consider seven main platforms of vaccine development, along with an eighth catch-all "other" category ( figure 4 ). there are two nucleic acid platforms: dna (12 candidates) and rna (20 + candidates), which could be sub-divided further according to particular traits related to delivery and carriers (e.g. electroporation with special devices intradermally vs oral formulation or lnps vs exosomes) but for simplicity are considered only as two categories. these nucleic acid platforms belong to the new generation of vaccines. neither has reached licensing for human use but a number are being tested in humans (cohen, 2020) . a third category termed "protein-based" (also referred to as "subunit" vaccine) includes a broad range of technologies to prepare immune-stimulating viral protein antigens and represents the largest category of all current covid-19 figure 2 | timelines for the development of various vaccines for polio, ebola virus, and three betacoronaviruses (sars-cov-1, mers-cov and sars-cov-2). on the left side of each timeline is a reference point for the first clinical case description and/or first recognized cases) for each type of viral infection. significant events are depicted along the timeline (not according to scale). solid horizontal red bars indicate the approximate period from first outbreak/vaccine to clinically approved use. dotted red lines indicate no availability of vaccines since first outbreak and the green dotted line represents a rapid emergency use authorization timeline for a putative sars-cov-2 vaccine.vaccine candidates (currently 44 + ) in development. like nucleic acids, protein-based vaccines represent a newer technology but some are already in use in the clinical realm (e.g. gardasil for human papillomavirus). the fourth and fifth categories are viralbased vectors, similar to those used in gene therapy and include nonreplicating (16 + candidates) and replicating (14 + candidates) vectors. the next two are the sars-cov-2 viruses themselves, either inactivated (usually with a chemical such as bpropriolactone, which chemically inactivates enveloped viruses and can inhibit viral membrane fusion in a dose-dependent manner) or in a live-attenuated version, generated by techniques such as codon deoptimization or serial passaging in cell culture (mueller et al., 2020) . the "other" category includes virus-like particles (vlps), the use of non-sars-cov-2 virus carriers such as killed rabies (coravax) and live modified horsepox (tx-1800). there are 10 + in this category. repurposed existing vaccines for polio or tuberculosis to evoke general immunity, various cellular immunotherapies to stimulate the host immune system, encapsulated convalescent serum, and "unknown" platform designation (listed in the milken institute database) are excluded from our analyses ( figure 4 ). according to these criteria, there are over 125 sars-cov-2 vaccines in development, which is astounding, from all across the globe in such a short time-frame.for the ideal covid-19 vaccine to reach routine use in humans, it is imperative that the vaccine protects against both clinical disease and viral transmission, in order to break the chain of person-to-person pandemic spread. some of the advantages/ disadvantages of each platform are considered in table 2 .in this section, we provide some specific details on 16 (of >125) vaccines in the pipeline that are registered for clinical trials or already being tested (as of may 25, 2020), in addition to those that are currently cepi-and/or barda-sponsored from each platform that are, or not yet, in clinical trials. this is to provide a snapshot of the field in early endeavors to procure a functional sars-cov-2 vaccine in man and their proposed developmental pipeline ( figure 5 ). one can also refer to table 3 for an abbreviated account of the 16 candidates. where the vaccine candidate's name has not been specified, we refer to it as "lead." figure 3 | development of the "ideal" vaccine for covid-19 depicted by concentric circles converging to the target. normally, development occurs in three discrete phases: research and development (r&d) involving platform selection, designing targets (e.g. whether that might be selection of an rna sequence and decisions on nucleoside substitutions, lipid nanoparticle (lnp) formulation, etc, or decisions on how to create a live-attenuated viral preparation) and preclinical testing in vitro in cell culture and in vivo in animals. for sars-cov-2 r&d, some of the animal models used are transgenic mice that overexpress the spike-binding protein ace-2, syrian hamsters, ferrets, and non-human primates (nhps). if encouraging results are apparent in the preclinical phase (indicated by various parameters in green boxes), the candidate vaccine is taken to the second phase, which consists of testing in human volunteers in three stages of clinical trials (phase i, phase ii, and phase iii). these may be concatenated to expedite approval (e.g. phase ii/iii). due to the pandemic nature of covid-19, both these outer concentric phases are being pursued simultaneously under expedited approvals with potential for emergency use authorizations. if, and only when, vaccine safety and efficacy is achieved in human volunteers, the logistical operations become the major hurdles to ensure worldwide distribution in a coordinated and inter-connected manner (manufacturing, supply chain distribution, storage, etc.). vaccine candidates that do not achieve satisfactory results in clinical trials, due to various factors shown in the red boxes, will be dropped from further development. ade, antibody-dependent enhancement; adcc, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; cdc, complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; vaerd, vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease; ae, adverse event.we do not endorse any particular candidate. cepi/who/ barda/gavi and governments are taking the pan-platform approach, recognizing that this is the best path forward. antigen: sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein (s) details of platform: dna plasmid expressing

press release of interim data 15 and ensuing evaluation (callaway, 2020c) , the company reported that in the initial eight participants mrna-1273 on the two lower doses (25 and 100 µg) evoked neutralizing antibody titer levels reaching or exceeding neutralizing antibody titers generally seen in convalescent sera as measured by a plaque reduction neutralization assay against live sars-cov-2. mrna-1273 was generally safe and well tolerated and provided full protection against viral replication in the lungs in a mouse challenge model. in view of these data, the company is forging on with phase ii and iii studies with an anticipated dose for phase iii using between 25 µg and 100 µg rna. since the level of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 is generally quite variable, and in some cases undetectable, in people who have recovered from covid-19 without hospitalization (wu et al., 2020b) , it remains to be seen how effective the moderna vaccine candidate will be at providing long-term immunity. this should come into focus in the upcoming large clinical trials.in this preclinical trial (van doremalen et al., 2020) , nhps (rhesus macaques) were administered a very high dose of sars-cov-2 after receiving a single dose of the vaccine (very similar to regimen being used in the current clinical trials). the active treatment group of animals (n=6) produced elevated levels of sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies compared to no increase in the control group (n=3). there were indistinguishable amounts of virus in the nasal compartment compared to control animals but significantly reduced viral load in the lungs. the vaccinated nhps were free of clinical-grade pneumonia, in contrast to the controls. although the levels of antibodies and cell-mediated cytokine responses in the vaccinated nhps were substantial, nobody knows yet whether this level of immune response will be protective in humans and how long that protection will last.in this complete analysis of phase i data obtained between march 16 and march 27, 2020, n=108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 36 y.o.) with equal numbers receiving low-, mid-and high-doses of the vaccine, there were mild-moderate aes in 75%-83% in each group (injection site pain, fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain) with no saes within the first 28 days post-vaccination. neutralizing antibodies increased significantly in the 14-28 day timeframe post-vaccination, along with specific t-cell responses.the data indicate that this ad5-vectored covid-19 vaccine warrants further investigation and they will continue with their phase ii randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study (see above).in this preclinical nhp study there was robust sars-cov-2-specific neutralizing antibody responses in the rhesus macaques that received three doses of the inactivated virus, which importantly afforded partial to full protection from clinical signs of lung injury after viral challenge. in addition, there were no signs of ade.the world is anxiously awaiting a safe, effective vaccine to protect against covid-19 in order to resume a "normal" lifestyle, free from public health agency/government lockdowns and fear of ongoing pandemic waves over the coming months-years. never before in the modern era of science has the accumulation of scientific papers in preprint archives (biorxiv/medrxiv, ≈5000 preprints) and peer-reviewed publications (pubmed, ≈22,000 papers) reached such exponential heights in such a short period with thousands of "all-things-considered" covid topics. mobilization of data sharing and joint global efforts toward this vaccine goal are monumental. it is hoped that the collaborative framework (such as activ, and others around the world) for prioritizing vaccine and drug candidates, streamlining clinical trials, coordinating regulatory processes and/or leveraging assets among various partners to rapidly respond to the covid-19 and future pandemics will soon be a reality. however, a successful path forward will be challenging and is certainly not guaranteed. for instance, no efficacious and approved vaccine for hiv/aids has come forward in over 30 years. the main hiv surface protein for host cell entry is covered in sugars, as is the spike protein of sars-cov-2, but to a lesser extent (watanabe et al., 2020) . will this site-specific glycan shield provide difficulties in target antigen recognition, if not properly reconstituted, in some of the vaccine platforms? will it be necessary to target more than just the spike protein, which most approaches are banking on? cryptic epitopes for antibody recognition need to be considered (yuan et al., 2020) and multivalent formulations may be required to generate effective long-lasting immunity with the ideal target product profile ( table 1) . sars-cov-2 antibody-based therapeutics derived from consortia such as covic 16 (coronavirus immunotherapy consortium) and other research groups/biopharma for covid-19 have already entered clinical trials 17 . these biologics, as well as repurposed drugs, will likely provide mid-term solutions while we wait patiently for the much-anticipated vaccine.cf and aa conceived the design and concepts. cf wrote the manuscript. cl contributed key information for table 1 . all authors contributed to the article and approved the submitted version.this research was funded by queen's university special research project 379415 (cdf).'companies that have the skill to be able to do it are not going to just sit around and have a warm facility, ready to go for when you need it', said anthony fauci, the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at nih, usa, and a member of the white house coronavirus task force, at a panel discussion (florko 2020) . he has been aware of the mood of vaccine-manufacturing big pharma, which has not changed much since the 1980s and is largely driven by a few very pertinent questions. will the demand fade away with the end of the outbreak? will the people choose, sometimes due to foolish reasons of vaccine hesitancy, not to use the product? what would be the timeline to reach breakeven and create wealth? with negligible prospects for profits, most drug makers have been neglecting emerging infectious disease areas. however, due to the present spread of the covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed, at the time of writing this article, 217,192 lives and infected 3,117,204 individuals so far, across all the continents except antarctica, the need for vaccines have rekindled new interests and with a higher enthusiasm (johns hopkins university 2020). this can be understood from the rapidity in response to contain the outbreak and designing modalities for treatment. according to reports from institute pasteur, shanghai, the first notice on treatments provided for pneumonia from hospitals in wuhan, china, was received on 30th december 2019. within 8 days, the coronavirus was identified, and by 10th january 2020, the very first genome of the virus was shared by the university of sydney on behalf of the chinese academy of sciences (fontanet 2020; huang et al. 2020) . consequent to that, a number of efforts are being made to socially contain the outbreak, screen available drugs for repurposing for covid-19 and design specific vaccines against the new coronavirus. this review highlights the genomic features of coronavirus that should be considered for vaccine design, current innovations in vaccine technology, global efforts, and future challenges in vaccine developments for covid-19.covid-19 is a new infectious disease of the respiratory tract with chances of developing fulminant pneumonia similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and is caused by the new coronavirus (sars-cov-2), which spreads through contact with respiratory droplets from nose and mouth (chan et al. 2020; who 2020a) . notably, 80% of people who are exposed or infected do not develop the active disease and show mild symptoms of seasonal flu and recover without major treatment. however, its estimated rate of incidence is much higher and is in the range of 20-60% in comparison with 8% for flu, and initial observations concludes that those developing severe disease require hospitalization for a period twice as much as that for acute flu (lenski 2020) . it originated in the hubei province of china in late 2019, and spread rapidly around the world through human-to-human transmission along the international air-travel routes. the case fatality rate for covid-19 at the time of writing this article stands at 10 times more than 0.1%, as reported for the seasonal flu (lenski 2020) . sars-cov-2 is the third member of the pathogenic coronavirus after sars-cov and mers-cov (causes the middle east respiratory syndrome) that shows severe pathology in humans among few others that only cause mild clinical symptoms like the flu (cui et al. 2019) . in the absence of a clinically proven effective treatment regime, current therapies for covid-19 mainly receive supportive care supplemented by different combinations of antiretroviral drugs. a few fda approved drugs and immune therapies are being repurposed and currently in clinical trials at several stages and available only on compassionate grounds. they have been proven efficacious in controlling sars, influenza, hiv, and the ebola virus replication by either targeting the viral rna polymerase or the poly-protein protease or by boosting host immunity as adjunct therapy (harrison 2020) . convalescent plasma from recovered individuals and monoclonal antibody therapies, which showed some success during the ebola outbreak in western africa, are being developed (van griensven et al. 2016) . these antibodies will also form the basis for the serological diagnosis of asymptomatic spreaders, which are absent at the moment. however, here we will restrict our discussion to the multiple vaccines being developed against sars-cov-2.3. origin of sars-cov-2 and genomic insights for vaccine development from the entire initial set of five genome sequences available, it was concluded that the new coronavirus is 99.9% identical among themselves, suggesting its recent entry into humans (zhou et al. 2020) . all the 3365 viral genomes known today form a tight cluster based on phylogeny and show evidences of only 20 mutational events, much lower than the expected rate of 10 -4 substitutions per site per year. this slow evolution is despite carrying rna as the genome and much to the advantage for vaccine researchers (dong et al. 2020) . the closest match with 88-96% overall identity is that of the bat-derived beta-coronaviruses, indicating a zoonotic origin of the disease, similar to sars and mers but genetically distinct from the respective coronaviruses (andersen et al. 2020) . interestingly, genomic and evolutionary evidence places the coronavirus found in malayan pangolins (pangolin-cov) as the next best match with greater than 91% identity, thus hinting at the anteater as a possible intermediate host to the new coronavirus after spillover from bats, like the palm civets and the dromedary camels in case of sars-cov and mers-cov, respectively ). further, the study posits pangolins-cov as the possible common ancestor for the human and bat versions based on the key amino acid residues present in its surface protein and crucial for interaction with the host receptor. recombination events among the small sub-genomic regions are very common in coronaviruses due to the high level of coinfection that exists in their hosts. therefore, tracing the evolutionary history of coronaviruses can be quite challenging and debatable.its positive-strand rna genome consists of six major open reading frames and accessory genes coding for the typical non-structural proteins, including the rna-dependent rna polymerase, proteases, and the structural proteins, including the matrix (m), envelope (e), spike (s) and nucleoprotein (n). the surface spike (s) glycoprotein is responsible for binding to the human cell surface receptor, followed by membrane fusion and entry (figure 1) (de wit et al. 2016) . this spike protein is also pivotal for determining host specificity, estimating the capacity of disease transmission, and for production of neutralizing antibody in human. generally, the spike protein of coronaviruses consists of a signal peptide, extracellular, trans-membrane and intracellular regions. the hostrecognizing extracellular domain, responsible for cell membrane fusion, is divided by a polybasic cleavage site into a receptor binding s1 domain and the s2 domain (andersen et al, 2020) . when it comes to sequence identity at the amino acid level, which determines molecular recognition to the host receptor, the s1 domain shows only 68% identity in comparison with the bat version. expectedly, phylogenetic analysis also places the receptor binding domain to a lineage closer to that of the sars-cov version, thus suggesting a binding to the same angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) zhou et al. 2020) . further, it underscores the emergence and reservoirs of sars-cov-2, which originated from bats but may have jumped into pangolins, with a plausible long period of natural selection in human or human-like ace-2. the receptor binding domain appears to have accumulated mutation at five amino acid positions for optimizing binding to host following an early zoonotic transfer much before november 2019 (andersen et al. 2020 ). an educated speculation indicates that a covid-19-type epidemic may recur at any time in the future, by a different sars-cov-2 variant evolving from the early isolates under selective pressure in animals, further emphasizing the need for a vaccine.vaccination strategies can be effectively used to reduce disease severity, control transmission by viral shedding and prevent future infections. vaccines are usually directed to induce both arms of the adaptive immune response producing neutralizing antibody that prevents attachment to host cells and activate the body's t killer cells that recognize and kill infected cells. vaccine candidates are chosen from the various approaches available as per the level of protection required. the simplest method involves introducing a virus into the body after inactivation by chemicals, gamma irradiation or heat. proteins expressed on the dead viral surface serves as antigen and induce the production of neutralizing antibodies as in the case of the early polio vaccine (figure 1) (bandyopadhyay et al. 2015) . another method involves introducing weakened or attenuated versions of the virus that slowly replicates inside the host cell but provides enough viral antigen to induce an immune response, like the oral polio vaccine, rabies vaccine or the bcg vaccine given at birth to prevent childhood tuberculosis. administering a nonvirulent organism is less safe than the inactivated virus and has been the cause for disease outbreak, but is much superior in terms of establishing a mild infection necessary for mounting a successful adaptive immune response (afrough et al. 2019) . developing an attenuated vaccine in a short time is, however, challenging as it requires isolating a non-virulent strain through several rounds of time-consuming sub-culturing in the laboratory and requires adequate knowledge about the virulence factors expressed by the coronavirus. furthermore, the level and type of adaptive immune response sometimes depend on the strain used in the product. one each of the above types is currently under preclinical development to estimate efficacy and toxicity: formaldehyde-inactivated formulation is being developed by sinovac biotech in china, while a genetically modified poorly replicating coronavirus is being developed in a partnership between codagenix, usa, and serum institute of india, india, using their proprietary deoptimization technology platform earlier used for developing vaccines for zika, dengue and influenza (who 2020b).a more targeted approach involves inducing adaptive immunity by introducing immunogenic viral proteins or their fragments to generate both antibodies and cell-mediated immune response. delivering the antigenic epitopes with optimal levels of antigen presentation required for a broad protective immunity is vital for a successful immune response. the high degree of similarities in the genome, structural proteins, and even the host attachment receptor indicates the existence of a possible similarity in the immune responses against the two sars coronaviruses. this also means that conclusions made from studies on sars-cov proteins might help in determining the immunogenic determinants required for vaccine development. in addition to the high level of potent antibodies against the s and n proteins of sars-cov, which were incidentally short-lived, strong t-cell responses that provide long term protections were detected for the same structural proteins (tang et al. 2011) . intriguingly, when the experimentally identified dominant b-cell and t-cell epitopes of sars-cov were mapped to the amino acid sequence of the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, 27 t-cell epitopes matched the sars-cov-2 proteins without a single mutation. further, the epitopes located within the predicted receptor binding domain of the spike protein were associated with the most prevalent major histocompatibility complex (mhc) alleles in the human population (ahmed et al. 2020) . similarly, a large number of b-cell epitopes found complete sequence identity with that of the nucleocapsid protein and both s1 and s2 domains of the spike protein. the prevalence of epitopes corresponding to the less exposed s2 domain, however, indicates its possible access to antibodies post attachment to the host cell. this analysis also helps preclude the apprehensions about the mismatches observed in the receptor binding region of the s1 domain from the structural analysis of the spike protein (wrapp et al. 2020) . antibodies raised against the s2 domain of sars-cov spike protein may cross-react and neutralize sars-cov-2, thus positing an excellent opportunity for repurposing the candidate monoclonal antibodies that did not cross phase i trials for sars vaccine development (tian et al. 2020) . therefore, the spike protein of sars-cov can be confidently placed as the most potent antigenic determinant against which candidate vaccines should be developed.another important consideration in designing vaccines, particularly in case of rna viruses that generally have higher mutation rates, is the antigenic drift or genetic variability, which plays a pivotal role in choosing the best genome sequence of the viral strain for vaccine development, and this means we need to sequence the sars-cov-2 genome from as many regions possible from around the world (dong et al. 2020) . choosing the right vaccine candidate is as much an art as a science since finding the viral components that will not trigger severe inflammation but can provide a protective immune memory is not trivial, more so when nothing much is known about the immune pathology of the disease and the immune evasion strategies employed by the virus to evade the host defense and most of our assumption is based on studies conducted on sars-cov.several new vaccine generation methods, based on the concept of 'plug-and-play', have been developed that can be used to test candidates against multiple infections in a short time. this is possible primarily because the safety features are determined predominantly by the upstream and downstream process technology employed and not on the pathogen of interest. vignettes of certain approaches using recombinant virus technology, nucleic acid vaccines, self-disseminating and protein vaccine approaches will be briefly described here (figure 1).since a virus is an obligate intracellular replicative entity that requires the host cell for its proliferation, all vaccine strategies are aimed at preventing the attachment of the virus to the host cell. at the molecular interface, this recognition is characterized by binding of the viral surface protein (spike glycoprotein in sars-cov-2) to the receptor on human cells (ace2) (lu et al.) . antibodies generated against the surface protein antigen helps to neutralize this receptor binding, thus making protein subunit vaccines very popular. however, by themselves, these proteins would normally be unstable and may lose their molecular structure soon after injection, rendering it difficult for the immune cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus. furthermore, the free-floating viral protein may change its shape to a post-recognition stable conformation, which is very different from the prerecognition state as displayed on the surface of the virus. the molecular clamping approach uses joining key structural polypeptides at several regions in the protein structure to efficiently retain the original shape of the immunogenic epitopes, thus stimulating a stronger response (uniquest 2014).with advances made in understanding the replication and pathogenesis of a wide variety of viruses along with the development of tools for genetic manipulation, it is now possible to generate safer attenuated vaccines expressing recombinant viral protein antigens from a proxy infection model (robert-guroff 2007) . replicating vectors in use includes adenovirus, measles virus, poxvirus and vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) (humphreys and sebastian 2018) . these viruses are either non-pathogenic in humans (vsv) or carry a genetically modified genome which neutralizes their virulent nature. the coding sequence for the required protein/subunit antigen is attached to the genome for optimal expression, assembly and packaging into the recombinant virus. two major advantages underscore their potential as a vaccine of choice. its ability to elicit a complete (innate and adaptive) immune response that is also tunable in terms of type and intensity of the response is its biggest advantage. the proxy natural infection model employed also allows the induction of co-stimulatory immune molecules that provide an adjuvant effect. second, its replicative nature allows achieving similar protection at a 3-4 log lower dosage. vectors based on measles virus have been considered for vaccines against hiv-aids and sars due to its potential to provide lifelong immunity as a result of its ability to infect the antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) (zuniga et al. 2007 ).in this case, the genes essential for replication of the adenovirus are deleted, among others, from the adenoviral genome and replaced with antigenic protein coding genes at the locus (robert-guroff 2007). the most popular modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) is a natural attenuated version of poxvirus. through repeated sub-culture in chicken cells, mva has lost its ability to replicate and evade immune surveillance in human cells (kennedy and greenberg 2009 ). replication-deficient vectors can accommodate larger gene inserts and also provide stability in terms of not regaining virulence when compared with the replication-competent versions.one of the problems of using the protein subunit vaccine has been presenting the antigen in its most stable and effective conformation. vlps are composed of multiple structural proteins, which upon recombinant expression have the ability to selfassemble into nanostructures enclosing the capsid proteins within itself (syomin and ilyin 2019). the vlps can have a lipid envelope originating from the cell membrane producing them in the form of budding and can also be chimeric in nature, displaying an envelope protein from another virus. a wide range of production platforms expressing and correctly folding the antigenic proteins are available in bacterial and yeast systems, insect and mammalian cell lines and even in transgenic plants. in addition, since vlps lack a genome of its own, they offer a similar level of stability as non-replicating vectors, thus offering the safety of subunit vaccine and efficacy of the live-attenuated vaccine, together.nucleic acid-based vaccines have emerged as a better alternative to live and inactivated vaccines for treatments against emerging pathogens as the dna expressing the pathogen's protein can be produced in a short time. this does not involve growing the virus in the laboratory and gives equivalent protective immunity as other forms. in this case, the dna sequence is introduced, often facilitated by nano-carriers, directly to the cells of a specific tissue. once they make their way into the nucleus with the help of a targeting sequence, viral surface protein production, driven from an optimized promoter, is outsourced to the host cells natural machinery (hobernik and bros 2018) . dna vaccines are safe, stable and large quantities can be produced in a short time through cost-effective manufacturing processes, which is crucial for distribution in low-income regions.first identified while studying immunization with tumor antigens for cancer therapy, mrna vaccines are now extensively studied for emerging pathogens. like dna vaccines, they represent the new generation therapies and, being mrna in nature, avoid the risk of being integrated into the host genome, as a bonus. they come in two flavors, traditional mrna-based vaccines and self-amplifying mrna vaccines. both work on the strategy of using the host cell transcription machinery to produce the target proteins and induce adaptive immunity (pardi et al. 2018) . while the former is replication-deficient and contains the antigen's mrna, the latter codes for a modified genome of an rna virus where the target antigen of choice replaces the viruses' native genes coding for the structural proteins. the resulting virus can express the heterologous antigenic genes in the cytoplasm in high numbers but cannot package itself into a functional virus, while the mrna can amplify itself using the rna dependent rna polymerase coded in its genome (geall et al. 2012) .all of the above innovations are being rapidly utilized to develop multiple vaccines against the new coronavirus. several epidemiological models predict that the present pandemic will stay for quite some time, albeit in several small pockets around the world and reappear in the subsequent waves of infection. but, will coronavirus usher in a new era in developing innovative vaccines for emerging infectious disease beyond covid-19? we will have to wait for the results of the clinical trials to come out.vaccine development for infectious diseases is equally challenging, similar to drug development, and normally takes the same amount of time. in the case of covid-19, this is even harder because of unknown disease pathogenesis, unavailability of a validated animal model, and success is dependent on the human clinical trials. despite all this, the scale and severity of the current pandemic have attracted around 35 companies -big pharma, small biotechnology firms and university spinoffs -to develop a vaccine against sars-cov-2 (lee 2020; who 2020b). thanks to the attractive funding from two government agencies of the usa, biomedical advanced research and development authority (department of health, usa) and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (national institutes of health, usa), work has been initiated on as many as 44 candidate vaccines (table 1) , which are currently in clinical and preclinical stages. the covid-19 outbreak has also highlighted innovations in funding mechanism through the involvement of coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi), a global alliance-based vaccine accelerator for emerging infectious diseases, founded in 2017 by the governments of india and norway with initial support from the world economic forum and philanthropic organizations like the bill and melinda gates foundation, usa, and wellcome trust, uk. this generous funding has enabled several small biotechnology firms and academic institutions to triage their diverse candidates, which is essential in situations where it is hard to predict which one and at which stage will reach a cul-de-sac. the new candidates are not only based on traditional approaches, they are also being built on the existing vaccines and leveraging on platforms used to develop the sars or the mers vaccines. it is important to mention that although there are great similarities between the immunogenic epitopes of the two sars-covs, vaccines for covid-19 do not have to be similar to the ones proposed against other coronaviruses. the newly developed vaccine against the ebola zaire virus by glaxosmithkline, uk, was produced using the adenoviral vectors used for an hiv this candidate is based on a non-replicating adenoviral vector used for ebola, while university of oxford's jenner institute has proposed to start phase i trial for a non-replicating adenoviral vector-based vaccine backbone (chadox1) due to its proven efficacy among older people with underlying co-morbidities (devlin 2020) . among others, candidates that are undergoing preclinical testing are mrna-based vaccines from germany's curevac (funded by european union and cepi) and biontech (co-developed with pfizer). both companies are repurposing their leads from personalized cancer treatments to deliver vaccines that are tunable as per the level of immune response required (curevac 2020; pfizer 2020). like moderna, another american company novavax has redeveloped a spike protein-based vaccine for sars in combination with its proprietary matrix adjuvants. institute pasteur is leading a consortium with university of pittsburgh and themis biosciences, austria, to work on a replicating measles vaccine virus vector technology, based on sars-cov (pasteur institute 2020). with the availability of a high-resolution molecular structure of the trimeric spike protein, researchers at the university of queensland, australia, are using their disruptive molecular clamp technology, which helps the viral proteins to maintain their shape, thus enabling the immune system to mount a stronger response (university of queensland 2020). it is being combined with glaxosmithkline's proprietary adjuvants in order to generate a long-lasting immune response. a lower adjuvanted dose allows immunization of a larger number of individuals with a low amount of the protein product. the same adjuvant-based potentiation is also being offered for clover biopharmaceutical's trimeric spike protein vaccine candidate. a very promising and widely discussed dna vaccine candidate (ino-4800), being developed by inovio pharmaceuticals, has succeeded in raising funds from cepi. although dnabased vaccines have not received any regulatory approvals in the past, and the company has not delivered any vaccine since its inception, it has committed to start clinical trials in april 2020 and has received support from the bill and melinda gates foundation to develop an intradermal electroporation device for vaccine delivery (linnane 2020) .intriguingly, large-scale phase iii randomized control trials have started in australia and netherlands to check for the effectiveness of the bcg vaccine, a live-attenuated strain of mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis in cattle, in reducing incidences and disease severity among the healthcare workers exposed to sars-cov-2 (byrne 2020). this recent development stems from a report which claimed to have found an excellent correlation on country-wise severity of covid-19 symptoms to its national immunization program for protection against childhood tb and tb meningitis (miller et al. 2020) . it is also not surprising to note that countries practicing compulsory bcg vaccination are also socio-economically backward, therefore reports of low morbidity and mortality from covid-19 may be related to low co-morbidities contributed by lifestyle diseases and not necessarily a protection offered by bcg vaccination. the study draws a link between high mortalities in iran, which started bcg vaccination later in 1984, with the lack of non-specific protection among the older population. the non-specific protection by bcg against viral infections is plausibly offered by the induction of innate immune memory, again a very new concept in itself, that results in enhanced production of immune modulators and cytotoxic activity of immune cells. nevertheless, if true, this might help to provide some levels of protection until a new specific vaccine is made available (moorlag et al. 2019) . however, it would be interesting to learn about the outcome of these large trials with respect to the degree of protection achieved as different strains of bcg is known to provide a wide range of efficacies in the case of tuberculosis in adults.usually, it takes 10-15 years of development through the classical path using inactivated or live attenuated vaccines after generating long-term efficacy data. during the ebola emergency, this time was brought down to 5 years for candidates that are based on viral vector vaccines and involved running a few key steps of phase ii trials in parallel. as the covid-19 contagion rapidly engulfs a quarter of the world's population, inovio pharmaceutical has ambitiously accelerated this timeline to publish the human clinical trials data by the fall of 2020, which is remarkably less than a year (inovio pharmaceuticals 2020). this is also expected, keeping in mind that there might not be enough patient volunteers available to participate in the human trials later. however, the test cohort should not miss out on including different age groups, ethnicity, gender and pregnant women. finally, data needs to be collected for any rare occurrence of immunization-mediated enhancement of severe illness after infection. this is primarily caused by the development of sub-neutralizing antibodies, which promotes excessive viral entry to the host cells (wan et al. 2020) . however, when it comes to manufacturing and delivery, the process faces myriad of new challenges as often experienced by the pharmaceutical industry. large quantities of the candidate vaccine are generally required to start a full-scale phase iii trial and immunizations thereafter; moreover, each product will require a customized scale-up technology that will have to be developed. more and more pharmaceutical companies have shifted focus to the risk-averse lifestyle disease, and this has resulted in their losing the skillset and expertise required for vaccine development. this needs to be re-built by continuous financial commitments with no immediate guarantee for rewards and an unprecedented level of international cooperation, which is thankfully quite visible. another important question that may arise and needs some clarity is selecting the target cohort for immunization. healthier individuals might be naturally protected and more vulnerable while the needy older population might show problems of a poor immune response and require higher doses. certainly, healthcare workers need them the most in our preparedness for the next wave of infection and perhaps also the traders in the wet markets if they continue to be in business.in conclusion, once we have the vaccine and hopefully the apex of the pandemic is over, an effective policy needs to be carefully prepared to develop a global access framework for equitable distribution in the developing world while protecting intellectual property and market rights. distribution of the vaccines should be made as far as possible based on humanitarian benevolence, centrally through international agencies including global alliance for vaccines and immunization (gavi), unicef and who. allowing the vaccine producing countries or the richest economies to stockpile the doses for the native population in the absence of a national emergency, as seen in the case of h1n1 influenza virus vaccine in 2009, will jeopardize all the momentum gained thus far (fidler 2010) .the reader will be able to:-understand of the types of vaccine and vaccine platforms being developed for sars-cov-2.-develop knowledge regarding the concerns around coronavirus vaccine development.-appreciated the issues of rapid vaccine development in outbreak settings.-ongoing progress of candidate vaccines through preclinical and clinical studies.-ongoing detailed characterisation of the immunopathogenesis of covid-19.-implementation of large scale post marketing surveillance systems to monitor sars-cov2 vaccine safety.introduction:covid-19 is the disease caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2). the disease was first reported in december 2019 wuhan, china [1] and the full genome was sequenced and published by january 05, 2020. [2] by march 11, 2020, covid-19 had spread globally and was declared a pandemic, with, at the time of writing, june 6 th 2020, there has been over 6 million people infected and 380,000 deaths.[3]the disease primarily affects the respiratory tract and disease severity can range from very mild rhinorrhoea to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. [4] [5] [6] a substantial minority of infections are asymptomatic. non-respiratory symptoms such as anosmia, diarrhoea, rash, thromboembolic disorders, myocarditis and vasculitis have also been associated with covid- 19 . [5] [6, 7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] the median incubation period is estimated to be 5 days with a majority developing symptoms by 11.5 days. [14] covid-19 patients have been shown to excrete viral nucleic acid at highest levels at the onset of symptoms [15] . this, and other epidemiological data [16] suggests transmissibility within an as yet undefined pre-symptomatic period. [16] clinical deterioration is usually delayed into the second week of illness and associated with laboratory features of an immune-mediated cytokine storm causing widespread inflammation and disseminated intravascular coagulation, usually with low level viraemia. [17, 18] the case fatality rate (death amongst persons with disease) is consistently reported to be age dependent, with a higher percentage in elderly (aged >70 years) cases dying, although other factors are also associated with intensive care admission and mortality [9] [6] [19] including sex (male>female), hypertension, obesity and diabetes. the reported case fatality rates [cfr] have been between 0.82% and 9.64%, with variability in cfr likely due to the testing frequency and access as well as other health system capacity factors in different locations. [20] the infection fatality rate (ift; death amongst all people infected -asymptomatic and not tested) is a better estimate of population mortality and is modelled to be between 0.1% to 0.41% [20] sars-cov-2 is one of three coronaviruses that may cause severe respiratory diseases, including in addition to these novel epidemic viruses with zoonotic origins, there are four other endemic human coronaviruses in circulation, hcov2-229e, -hku1, -nl63 and -oc43 all predominantly causing mild symptoms of the common cold. [21] history of vaccines for coronaviruses:coronaviruses have a large (30+ kb) single-stranded positive sense rna genome encased by a helical nucleocapsid (n) and an outer envelope comprised of matrix protein (m), envelope protein (e) and spike proteins (s). [22] the s protein, which naturally occurs in a trimeric form, contains the receptor-binding domain (rbd) responsible for binding onto the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) and entry into the cell (figure 1 ). in sars-cov, of all the structural proteins, s protein was found to elicit neutralising antibody and is a major target antigen for vaccine development. [23] [ 24] there have been difficulties in the development of coronavirus vaccines historically. coronavirus vaccines in animal models that mimic human disease have been immunogenic but generally not shown to effectively prevent acquisition of disease [25] . further, there is a concern that vaccination, as with natural coronaviral infection, may not induce long lived immunity and re-infection may be possible. [26] in some ways more concerning has been vaccine associated disease enhancement.previous use of coronavirus vaccines (sars-cov and mers-cov) in some animal models raised safety concerns regarding th2 mediated immunopathology. [27] mice vaccinated with two inactivated whole virus vaccines, a recombinant dna spike protein vaccine or a virus-like particle vaccine developed lung pathology including eosinophilic infiltration 2 days after being challenged with sars-cov which were not seen in the lungs of challenged unvaccinated mice. [28] similar lung immunopathology was observed in several other studies, particularly in aged mice compared to younger mice [29] that were challenged following vaccination [30, 31] context:developing and scaling-up mass production of a vaccine rapidly in a global pandemic setting is challenging as it requires many activities to be well-coordinated and occurring in parallel, in contrast to the usual decade long, sequential process with pre-clinical testing, phased clinical trials, planned production and distribution. these challenges result in an aggregation of invested resources and even if sustained immunity is attained after infection by sars-cov2, estimates are that 60-70% of a population would need to be immune to achieve herd immunity against sars-cov2. [70] the safest and most controlled way for effective and sustainable prevention of covid-19 in a population is to have an efficacious and safe vaccine and the majority of the population successfully vaccinated. in addition, the vaccine should also be readily mass-produced inexpensively, and be easily transportable with minimal cold chain requirements to have global utility. immunity after primary covid-19 infection seems to protect against re-infection in primate models and is likely to occur in humans [71] ; whether this can be mimicked in vaccines and for how long immunity may last is still uncertain. following sars-cov infection, igg and neutralising ab was detectable for 1 to 3 years following infection which suggests that vaccine-induced protection is unlikely to be long-lasting and may require re-immunization. there has never been a more rapid pace to vaccine development. the pandemic situation has been a challenge and a trigger to reconsidering the usual approaches to regulatory assessment and licensing processes. vaccine companies are showing willingness to commit to scaled-up production prior to definitive phase 3 trial results. [79] the implementation of high quality, aligned surveillance for covid-19 across multiple regions concurrently with vaccine deployment is critical both for evaluating the real-world effectiveness of a new vaccine against sars-cov-2, but also for monitoring its safety in so-call 'post-marketing' surveillance. the association of rotavirus vaccines with intussusception in children was only detected following licensure and deployment of these vaccines. over the last 5 months, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has precipitated a global health and economic crisis, dramatically altering the daily lives of billions of people. rapid community transmission of sars-cov-2 has been enabled, in part, by its biology and its novelty. humans have no preexisting immunity to this brand-new human pathogen, and we are all susceptible to infection (though not uniformly likely to develop symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 ). in the short term, social distancing measures are decreasing community transmission but are exacting enormous costs from individuals and businesses, leading prominent voices to call for lifting restrictive measures. however, as relatively few people are immune to sars-cov-2, covid-19 cases will almost certainly surge if normal activities resume.the only long-term way to control sars-cov-2 is for most people to become immune to the virus, so that herd immunity slows down spread. one way to achieve the needed level of protection is for the virus to sweep through the population, at the cost of extensive casualties. far better would be developing and deploying a safe and effective vaccine to generate widespread immunity, with dual goals of protecting individuals and controlling the pandemic.the covid-19 pandemic has triggered an explosion of potential vaccine candidates and calls for their rapid and widespread deployment, prompting discussions about the risks of advancing unvetted vaccines into the general population. fortunately, the process of vaccine licensure is designed to ensure vaccine safety and efficacy, particularly since vaccines are given to healthy people who might never be exposed to sars-cov-2 or develop severe disease. the most effective way to identify and deploy efficacious sars-cov-2 vaccines with acceptable safety profiles is through carefully designed, scientifically rigorous clinical trials conducted at an accelerated pace.recent technological advances in vaccine design and global commitments to addressing epidemic diseases have provided a rich infrastructure to support the necessary response to covid-19. the moderna messenger rna vaccine, currently being studied in the united states, was administered to the first human subject just 63 days after the sars-cov-2 genetic sequence was released from china. this achievement was facilitated by the acceptable human safety profiles of similar vaccine constructs targeting other diseases, including zika and avian influenza. seven other vaccine clinical trials have started in the united states, united kingdom, germany, and china, and the list of preclinical vaccine candidates now is 100 [1, 2] .it is not yet clear whether sars-cov-2 infection results in durable protective immunity, by what mechanism it might do so, and whether vaccine-elicited immune responses will protect without causing harm. early studies are promising. up to 95% of mild covid-19 cases induce some level of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov-2 [3] , and nonhuman primates infected with sars-cov-2 are protected from reinfection with the virus [4] . survivors of infections with related coronaviruses, sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), developed neutralizing antibodies that persisted for 1-3 years after infection. phase 1 studies of dna vaccines for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov were well tolerated and immunogenic in humans [5, 6] . these reports suggest that sars-cov-2 vaccines could safely induce protective immune responses, and it seems likely that 1 or more of the 108 candidate vaccines in development will be ultimately licensed.yet, there is reason for caution as the experience in animal models is inconclusive. some sars-cov-1 and mers-cov vaccine candidates appear to exacerbate illness in animals after subsequent viral challenge [7] . such vaccine-enhanced disease harks back to respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) and dengue vaccines that caused harm. the mechanisms underlying enhanced disease remain controversial, but certain patterns have emerged. detrimental responses were more common but not ubiquitous after immunization with whole-inactivated sars-cov-1 and mers-cov vaccines [8] [9] [10] , perhaps due to immune responses against the nucleocapsid protein [11] (not present on the viral envelope) or to chemical modifications that alter epitopes or antigen processing [12] . however, a new whole-inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine reportedly induced neutralizing antibodies and protected rhesus macaques from viral challenge without overt safety concerns [13] .given the association of wholeinactivated vaccines with enhanced disease, one might expect that vaccine platforms delivering isolated spike protein (present on the viral envelope) could elicit protective immunity without provoking immunopathology. indeed, protein and dna vaccines can induce strong neutralizing antibody responses against sars-cov-1 and mers-cov [14, 15] . accordingly, many sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates are designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against the sars-cov-2 spike [1] . however, anti-sars-cov-1 spike antibodies elicited by a vaccinia vector were shown to worsen lung injury in chinese macaques postchallenge, potentially through infection and proinflammatory reprogramming of macrophages [16] . this study, along with several other reports, suggests a role for antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) through cell-surface fc receptors [16] [17] [18] [19] . the probability of ade varies with antibody concentration [17, 19] , suggesting that its effects might appear late after vaccination and highlighting the need for long-term follow-up in clinical studies.many of the harmful immune responses to prior coronavirus vaccine candidates appear to hinge on the balance between the type of helper t-cell response. in general, th1 responses are thought to promote protective immunity, while th2 responses, stimulated by adjuvants such as alum, are associated with eosinophils in the lungs of experimental animals [7] . pulmonary eosinophilia was a prominent feature of enhanced disease associated with an rsv vaccine [12] , but th2-like responses to sars-cov-1 can be protective despite eosinophilic histopathology [9] . th1-and th2-type inflammatory responses also influence antibody isotype repertoire and subsequent interactions with fc receptors [20] , potentially modifying the risk of antibody-induced immunopathology. manipulating the balance of th1 and th2 responses through adjuvants, such as toll-like receptor agonists and delta inulin, may reduce the risk of vaccine-enhanced disease [8, 20] .overall, the mechanisms underlying the immunopathology of coronavirus vaccines and the differences among vaccine candidates and animal models remain poorly understood. potential factors include the vaccine itself, the viral strain used for challenge, the animal model, and the timing and dose of both vaccine and challenge. identifying the basis for immunopathology will be important for optimizing vaccine candidates.ordinarily, unresolved questions about coronavirus immunology might have been answered before human clinical trials. now, however, delays in developing a safe and effective vaccine will cost lives. we thus need to carefully weigh decisions about study duration, follow-up, and clinical and biological monitoring to comprehensively obtain the information needed to assess the safety of sars-cov-2 vaccines. early studies should be performed in healthy adults who are fully informed about areas of uncertainty regarding risks, and human challenge studies are an intriguing but controversial approach to assessing efficacy and safety [21] . these considerations are especially important since many candidate vaccine platforms are novel and have not yet yielded licensed vaccines.standardized metrics of immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety should be coordinated at an international level to ensure that vaccine studies can be directly compared and to promote accountability among research teams and private developers. the world health organization has an important role in this process. experts convened by the brighton collaboration working with the center for epidemic preparedness innovations supported the conduct of ongoing vaccine studies and advocated for standardized safety assessments of local and systemic reactions. they also recommended measuring potential biomarkers of vaccine-enhanced disease, which may include the ratios of neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies, antibody isotypes and affinities, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and the polarity of t-cell responses [7] . ongoing therapeutic trials using convalescent sera should examine the conditions under which infection-derived antibodies are protective. in addition, animal studies should continue concurrently to resolve unanswered questions about immunogenicity and immunopathology. concerning results in any experimental system should prompt rapid reconsideration of related clinical trials.the research community is making unprecedented advances toward rapidly developing sars-cov-2 vaccines. this is a laudable goal, and scientists, regulators, and clinicians must remain steadfast against pressure to bypass the established scientific, ethical, and regulatory standards in an attempt to accelerate vaccine availability. our community must push forward in generating high-quality, reliable data while we strive to save lives.disclaimer. the views expressed are solely those of the authors and not those of any of their affiliate institutions or

very few known applications on eukaryotes and viruses. so, it is worthwhile to explore the potential of this approach to identify potential vaccine candidates for coronavirus. rv basically does the in silico examination of the viral proteome to hunt antigenic and surface-exposed proteins. this approach was initially applied successfully to neisseria meningitidis serogroup b (kelly and rappuoli 2005) against which none of the prevailing techniques could develop a vaccine. the present book chapter is intended to explore the potential of rv approach to select the probable vaccine candidates against coronavirus and validate the results using docking studies.undoubtedly, the traditional approaches for vaccine development are fortunate enough to efficiently resist the alarming pathogenic diseases of its time. however, the traditional approach suffers from certain limitations like it is very timeconsuming, the pathogens which can't be cultivated in the lab conditions are out of reach, and certain non-abundant proteins are not accessible using this approach (rappuoli 2000) . consequently, a number of pathogenic diseases are left without any vaccine against them. all these limitations are conquered by reverse vaccinology approach utilizing genome sequence information which ultimately is translated into proteins. hence all the proteins expressed by the genome are accessible irrespective of their abundance, conditions in which they expressed. the credit of fame of reverse vaccinology should go to the advancements in the sequencing strategies worldwide. accordingly, improvement in the sequencing technologies has flooded the genome databases with huge amount of data which can be computationally undertaken to reveal the various crucial aspects of the virulence factors of the concerned pathogen. reverse vaccinology is based on same approach of computationally analysing the genome of pathogen and proceeds step by step to ultimately identify the highly antigenic, secreted proteins with high epitope densities. the best epitopes are selected as potential vaccine candidates (pizza et al. 2000) . this approach has brought the unapproachable pathogens of interest in spotlight and is evolving as the most reassuring tool for precise selection of vaccine candidates and brought the use of peptide vaccines in trend (sette and rappuoli 2010; kanampalliwar et al. 2013 ).bexsero is the first universal serogroup b meningococcal vaccine developed using rv, and it has currently earned positive judgement from the european medicines agency (gabutti 2014) . whether it is discovery of pili in gram-positive pathogens which were thought to not have any pili or the sighting of factor g-binding protein in meningococcus (alessandro and rino 2010), the reverse vaccinology steals all the credits from other conventional approaches. most of the applications of rv are against prokaryotes and very few against eukaryotes and viruses because of complexity of their genome. corynebacterium urealyticum (guimarães et al. 2015) , mycobacterium tuberculosis (monterrubio-lópez et al. 2015) , h. pylori (naz et al. 2015) , acinetobacter baumannii (chiang et al. 2015) , rickettsia prowazekii (caro-gomez et al. 2014) , neospora caninum (goodswen et al. 2014) and brucella melitensis (vishnu et al. 2017) are the examples of some pathogens that are recently approached using this in silico technique in order to spot some epitopes having potential of being a vaccine candidate. herpesviridae (bruno et al. 2015 ) and hepatitis c virus (hcv) (kolesanova et al. 2015) are the examples of the viruses that are addressed using this approach. (altschul et al. 1990; okonechnikov et al. 2012; golosova et al. 2014) . multiple sequence alignment (msa) was done via clustalw, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using nj method from unipro ugene 1.16.1 bioinformatics toolkit (okonechnikov et al. 2012 ).analysis of secondary structure of the proteins of seed genome was done by means of expasy portal. the aim is to forecast the solvent accessibility, instability index, theoretical pi, molecular weight, grand average of hydropathicity (gravy), aliphatic index, number of charged residues, extinction coefficient etc. (http://web. expasy.org/protparam/; gasteiger et al. 2005) .virus-mploc was used to identify the localization of proteins of virus in the infected cells of host (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/virus-multi/; hong-bin shen and kuo-chin chou 2010) . this information is important to understand the destructive role and mechanism of the viral proteins in causing the disease. in total six different subcellular locations, namely, host cytoplasm, viral capsid, host plasma membrane, host nucleus, host endoplasmic reticulum and secreted proteins, were covered. these predictions could help in formulation of better therapeutic options against the virus. as per the protocol of rv, secreted and membrane proteins are of special interest, therefore, filtered for further analysis. to predict the number of transmembrane helices tmhmm server v. 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/; krogh et al. 2001 ) was used.signal peptides are known to impact the immune responses and possess high epitope densities. moreover, most of the known vaccine candidates also possess signal peptides. hence, it is worthwhile to predict signal peptides in proteins prior to epitope predictions. signal-blast web server is used to predict the signal peptides without any false predictions (http://sigpep.services.came.sbg.ac.at/signalblast.html; frank and sippl 2008) . the prediction options include best sensitivity, balanced prediction, best specificity and detect cleavage site only. we choose to make the predictions using each option, and the proteins predicted as signal peptide by all the four options were preferred for further investigation.the most appropriate targets as vaccine candidates are those which possess the adhesion-like properties because they not only mediate the adhesion of pathogen's proteins with cells of host but also facilitate transmission of virus. adhesions are known to be crucial for virulence and are located on surface which makes them promptly approachable to antibodies. the stand-alone spaan with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100% was used to carry out the adhesion probability predictions, and the proteins with having adhesion probabilities higher than or equal to 0.4 were selected (sachdeva et al. 2004 ).betawrap motifs are dominant in virulence factors of the pathogens. if the proteins are predicted to possess such motifs, then they are appropriate to be taken under reverse vaccinology studies. betawrap server is the only online web server to make such predictions. the proteins having p-value lower than 0.1 were anticipated to contain betawraps (http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/betawrap/betawrap.html; bradley et al. 2001 ).for added identification of the antigenic likely of the proteins, they were subjected to vaxijen server version 2.0. it is basically an empirical method to hunt antigenic proteins. so, if the proteins are not found antigenic using other sequence-based methods, then they can be identified using this method. this step confirms the antigenicity of proteins selected using above-mentioned steps (http://www.ddgpharmfac.net/vaxijen/vaxijen/vaxijen.html; doytchinova and flower 2007).for being a probable vaccine candidate, the protein should not exhibit the characteristics of an allergen as they trigger the type-1 hypersensitivity reactions causing allergy. therefore, to escape out such possibilities, the proteins were also subjected to allergenicity predictions using allertop (http://www.pharmfac.net/ allertop; dimitrov et al. 2014) and algpred tools (http://www.imtech.res.in/ raghava/algpred/submission.html; saha and raghava 2006a, b).to check whether the filtered proteins possess any similarity to host proteins or not, the standard blastp (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) searches were performed. in case of sequence similarity, there is a feasibility of generation of immune responses against own cells.predicting the epitopes binding to mhc class i is the main decisive phase of the rv to carry out valid vaccine predictions. the predicted epitopes were docked with receptor that is hla-a*0201 using cluspro (http://cluspro.bu.edu/login.php; kozakov et al. 2017 ) that is an automated protein-protein docking web server. the literature searches provided the information of conserved residues of the receptor site. the default parameters were used for docking (comeau et al. 2004a, b; kozakov et al. 2006 ).a total of 40 different sequenced strains of coronavirus are available at ncbi. among them 7 strains are pathogenic to humans. various information regarding source, host and collection of these strains are presented in table 15 .1 and 15.2. this information can be obtained from ncbi's genome database, the virus pathogen database and analysis resource and genomes online database (liolios et al. 2006; pickett et al. 2012) . the mers strain is taken as seed genome as it is the most prevalent and disastrous strain among others. its proteome consists of total 11 proteins as shown in table 15 .3. the results of sequence similarity to reveal orthologs using blastp are shown in table 15 .4. the sequences with greater than 30% identity score are considered as homologs. the phylogenetic tree is depicted in fig. 15 .1 and the mers-cov, taken as seed genome, found clustered with different bat coronaviruses.the results of analysis of secondary structure of the proteome using expasy tools are shown in the table 15 .5. from the analysis of charge on the residues and ph values, it is concluded that six of the proteins are basic and positively charged unlike allergens which are acidic in nature. however, five proteins are acidic and show negative charge. the negative gravy score of five proteins justify them to be of hydrophilic nature with majority of the residues positioned towards the surface. for the rest of six proteins, the gravy score is positive; it means that these are the accession number and identity of orthologs obtained in different strains is shown in the table hydrophobic proteins. the proteins with less than 40 value of instability index are quite stable than those with higher values. all the proteins are having the molecular weight less than 110 kda except 3 (yp_009047202.1, yp_009047203.1 and yp_009047204.1). this exhibits the effectiveness of lightweight proteins as targets as they can be easily purified because of their low molecular weights. the protein yp_009047204.1 is reported as a spike glycoprotein. it is acidic with prominent negative charge, with negative gravy score which suggests its hydrophilicity and figure 15 .2 depicts the subcellular localization of proteins of the seed genome, i.e. mers-cov. only one protein was predicted to be localized in host cytoplasm, four in host membrane, two in both host cell membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (er) while two in only er, and two are left unrecognized. the known spike protein is predicted to be localized in host er. from these results we decided to pick the proteins which are located in host membrane or were predicted to be localized in both host membrane and er. the two are known envelop protein and membrane protein from bibliographic studies, and along with that, the known spike protein was also included in the filtered results. out of the filtered proteins, only two (yp_009047210.1 and yp_009047208.1) contain more than two transmembrane helices, therefore filtered out. the results of transmembrane helices prediction are tabulated in table 15 .6. figure 15 .3 depicts the subcellular localization of proteins of all the four selected genomes using virus-mploc prediction tool. the proteins that are predicted to possess the signal peptides by signal-blast web server are yp_009047204.1 and yp_009047205.1. the results of signal-blast web server are tabulated in the table 15 .7.this step takes into account the concept of adhesion-based virulence. adhesions cause pathogen recognition and initiation of inflammatory responses by the host. spaan predicted 2 (yp_009047204.1 and yp_009047205.1) out of 11 proteins of mers strain as adhesive (table 15 .8).only one protein (yp_009047204.1) was predicted to contain betawrap motifs within it (table 15 .8). hence, it is considered virulent and might be responsible for initializing the infection in the host. a total of 9 out of 11 proteins of mers strain were predicted antigenic (prediction values greater than 0.4). the protein with accession number yp_009047206.1 and yp_009047208.1 were among the filtered proteins, however, not predicted antigenic, therefore filtered out. as a result, only four proteins (yp_009047204.1, yp_009047205.1, yp_009047207.1 and yp_009047209.1) were kept for further analyses.none of the 11 proteins of mers-cov possessed any clue of allergenicity as per prediction results from algpred and allertop tools; it means that no vigorous immune responses will be mounted if the epitopes from these proteins will be adopted as vaccine candidates.none of the protein of mers strain shows similarity with the proteins of host that demonstrates that the epitopes from these proteins can safely elicit the required immune response without the hazard of autoimmunity.in total 12 different 9-mer epitopes with potential to bind to receptors of both b-cell and t-cell were predicted. the list of the predicted epitopes can be found in the table 15 .9 and are specific for mers-cov strain. all these epitopes displayed no conservancy with proteins of other human and non-human pathogenic strains.docking permits to reveal the binding energy or potency of connection among epitopes and the receptor in appropriate orientation. the cluspro docking server was used to dock the predicted 90 epitopes against hla-a*0201. the structure of the receptor was available from pdb and was optimized before docking to free it from the complexed self-peptide (4u6y, resolution 1.47 å, bouvier et al. 1998 ). pepstr (peptide tertiary structure prediction server; kaur et al. 2007 ) was used to derive the tertiary structure of the predicted peptides. figure 15 .4 depicts the quaternary structure of the receptor hla-a*0201 with its conserved active site known to form complex with the peptides (bouvier et al. 1998 ). the binding energy results obtained after performing docking analysis are listed in table 15 .9.the 9-mer epitope vvcaitllv at site 21 of protein yp_009047209.1 docked to the receptor with smallest amount of binding energy (à951.7) and 12 hydrogen bonds. the next epitope in the list was also from the same protein yp_009047209.1 at site 27, i.e. tllvcmafl. the predicted structure of the top 5 potent epitopes on the basis of docking energy and the snapshots of docking results are displayed in figs. 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8 and 15.9 .the most chief restriction for developing a safe and sound vaccine against any of the virus is to identify the protective antigens. the present study is an effort of application of reverse vaccinology approach to investigate a choice of coronavirus proteomes to identify possible vaccine targets. this technique has demonstrated to be a competent way to forecast 12 different epitopes from the selected seed genome. these epitopes are from spike glycoprotein, ns3 protein, ns4b protein and envelope protein. unfortunately none of the epitope is found conserved in other strains, and all are specific to mers-cov. the docking analysis studies revealed perfect binding between hla-a*0201 receptor and epitopes. the conserved residues of the receptor site are also involved in h-bonding with epitope residues. further, the selected antigenic epitopes must be validated using in vitro and in vivo studies to confirm their potential as vaccine candidates. severe acute respiratory syndrome is a new disease which emerged in china in late 2002 and spread rapidly around the world. this epidemic, which resulted in over 8000 infections and almost 800 deaths, raised considerable concerns that this emerging agent constituted a serious threat for global public health. the identification of a novel coronavirus (sars-cov) associated with this syndrome [1] [2] [3] humans [4] . thus, despite the disappearance of the disease in humans, there is still an urgent need for rapid development of a safe and effective vaccine. it is generally considered that live attenuated viruses are the most effective viral vaccines because of their ability to induce strong cellular and humoral immune responses [5] . however, the need for extensive safety testing of such vaccines can delay entry of such candidate vaccines into clinical trials. multiple studies have reported that antibodies directed against the spike (s) glycoprotein can neutralise sars-cov infectivity [6] [7] [8] [9] . the s protein is reported to bind to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hace-2) protein to mediate viral entry to the cell [10] . human monoclonal antibodies directed against the s protein have been reported to reduce replication of the virus in the lung of infected ferrets and to completely prevent the development of sars co-v induced lung pathology [11] . in addition, a number of candidate vaccines induced protection against challenge with live virus in animal models, and this protection was associated with high levels of neutralising antibody [12] [13] [14] . thus, it is likely that an inactivated or recombinant candidate vaccine containing the s protein will be able to induce protective immunity based primarily on stimulation of a humoral immune response.we have favoured the development of an inactivated candidate whole virus vaccine as we have a well-established technology for rapid development of such vaccines. we have previously reported on the use of large scale vero cell fermenter cultures for the development of an inactivated whole virus influenza vaccine [15] . this technology has been adapted for the development of a double inactivated whole virus sars co-v candidate vaccine. we report here on the characterisation of this candidate vaccine with respect to safety and immunogenicity.sars-cov cdc#200301157 (also referred to as strain utah; genbank accession number ay714217) was obtained from the cdc (atlanta, usa). it was isolated from sputum of a sars patient in the usa (specimen #809940) and passaged two times on gmp grade vero cells.denatured samples of the purified sars-cov vaccine (about 1 g protein/lane) were separated on a 10% tris-hcl sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and subsequently blotted onto a pvdf membrane. protein staining was done with the aurodye tm forte staining kit (amersham bioscience/ge healthcare, uk) according to manufacturers instructions. rabbit antibodies directed against the sars-cov nucleocapsid (n) protein (img-548) or s protein (img-557), respectively, were obtained from imgenex (san diego, ca, usa) and used for western blot analysis. after blocking and application of the primary antibody overnight at 2-8 • c (working dilution: 1:1000), membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horse radish peroxidase (hrp)-labelled goat anti-rabbit igg (accurate chemical, westbury, usa). following final washing, blots were developed using 3,3 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and h 2 o 2 .female cd1 mice (6-8 weeks old) were obtained from the charles river laboratories subsidiary in sulzfeld, germany. after sampling of pre-immune sera, mice were immunised with six different doses of the candidate vaccine ranging from 1 g to 0.3 ng total protein (method according to bradford [16] ). to evaluate the effect of adjuvantation on the immunogenicity of the vaccine, a non-adjuvanted preparation and material adjuvanted with 0.05 and 0.2% aluminium hydroxide (alum) was tested at each antigen concentration. groups of 10 mice were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 0.5 ml of each vaccine preparation; control groups received the same volume of buffer (tris-buffered saline) with or without 0.2% aluminium hydroxide. fourteen days postimmunisation, sera were drawn from each animal and a booster immunisation was carried out with the same formulation and dosage as inoculated during primary immunisation. sera were then drawn from each animal 4 weeks after primary immunisation (animals treated with the 0.2% aluminium hydroxide containing vaccine were also bled 12 weeks after primary immunisation).balb/c mice (6-7 weeks old) were also obtained from the charles river laboratories subsidiary. for cytokine studies groups of 15 mice balb/c mice were immunised s.c. with 1 g of vaccine adjuvanted with 0.2% alum. booster injections with the same formulation were given 14 and 28 days post primary immunisation. mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 21 and 35 days after the primary immunisation (five mice per group). a single cell suspension was prepared from the pooled spleens of five animals by forcing minced tissue through 200 mesh stainless steel sieves. red blood cells were depleted by incubation for 5 min at room temperature with lysis buffer containing 0.15 m nh 4 cl, 10 mm khco 3 and 0.1 m na 2 -edta, ph 7.4 and the leukocytes were suspended in complete cell culture medium.a subset of the immunised cd1 mice, i.e. four mice each of the groups that received vaccine doses of 0.2 g-0.3 ng and the control groups (see section 2.3.1), were challenged 5 weeks (groups that received the non-adjuvanted or the 0.05% aluminium hydroxide containing preparation) or 13 weeks (0.2% aluminium hydroxide) after primary immunisation. prior to challenge, a blood sample was drawn for determination of neutralising antibody titres. for challenge, mice were anaesthetised with isofluran and inoculated intranasally with a dose of 10 5 tcid 50 sars-cov contained in a volume of 20 l (10 l per nostril). non-cloned sars-cov cdc#200301157 that has been propagated five times on serum protein free vero sf cells was used for homologous challenge. on day 3 post inoculation (p.i.), mice were euthanised with isofluran followed by barbiturate, before lung and trachea were removed and frozen at ≤−60 • c. prior to titration in the tcid 50 assay, tissue samples were thawed and homogenised in 1 ml of vero cell culture medium supplemented with antibiotics.the igg titre against the s protein of sars-cov was determined by an indirect elisa. briefly, 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight at 2-8 • c with 100 ng of baculovirus (bv)-expressed, full-length, his-tagged s protein (protein sciences, meriden, ct, usa) in 50 mm carbonate buffer, ph 9.6 per well or left uncoated, respectively. subsequent to washing and blocking for 1 h with 3% non-fat dry milk, serial fourfold dilutions of sera (starting with a 1:100 dilution) were applied for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) containing 0.1% tween 20. bound antibodies were detected by hrp-labelled goat anti-mouse igg (accurate chemical, westbury, ny, usa; working dilution of 1:5000) followed by washes and development using opd/h 2 o 2 . finally, colour development was stopped by the addition of 5 m h 2 so 4 and the plates were read at 490/620 nm by elisa plate reader (bio-tek, winooski, vt, usa). to determine the endpoint antibody titre, all absorbance readings equal or greater than the cut-off value (four times the mean absorbance value of a 1:100 dilution of a negative control serum) were considered positive.serum samples were serially diluted with cell culture medium in twofold steps (usually beginning at a dilution of 1:20 or 1:40). the serum dilutions were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with a virus stock suspension adjusted to 10 3.5 tcid 50 /ml, incubated for 1 h at room temperature and transferred (eight replicates per dilution) to a 96-well tissue culture plate seeded with a vero cells. the plates were incubated for 5 days at 37 • c in a co 2 -incubator, before the cultures were inspected under a light microscope for the presence of a cytopathic effect (cpe) caused by sars-cov, i.e. cell rounding and detachment. the neutralising titre was calculated by the number of virus negative wells and the serum dilution according to the method of spearman [17] .the frequency of interferon-␥ (ifn-␥) or interleukin-4 (il-4) secreting cells was analysed using mouse ifn-␥ and il-4 elispot kits (mabtech ab, nacka, sweden) following the instructions of the manufacturer. serial dilutions of freshly isolated spleen cells of balb/c mice were added to the wells ranging from 5 × 10 4 to 2 × 10 5 cells per well of antibody-coated 96-well plates. for stimulation, sars candidate vaccine and recombinant bv-expressed s protein were added at a concentration of 0.1-1 g/ml. wells containing no antigen or 1 g/ml of pokeweed mitogen (sigma, st. louis, usa) were used as negative and positive control, respectively. the plates were then incubated overnight at 37 • c and 5% co 2 before the cells were discarded and the plates were washed with pbs. interferon-␥ or il-4, respectively, was detected by a biotinylated interferon-␥ or il-4 specific antibody followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and development with bcip/nbt substrate solution. the number of spots was counted using an automated elispot reader (aid, strassberg, germany). the number of spots observed in wells containing no antigen was subtracted from the number of spots observed in wells containing specific antigen and the results were expressed as spot forming cells (sfc) per 10 6 spleen cells.the infectious virus titre of sars-cov-containing samples was determined by a tcid 50 assay. in brief, serial 10-fold dilutions of virus containing samples were inoculated onto 96-well microtiter plates seeded with vero cells. after incubation for 5-7 days at 37 • c in a co 2 -incubator, the plates were screened under a light microscope for the presence of a cpe. from the number of virus positive wells per dilution, the tcid 50 was calculated according to the poisson formula by means of an in-house calculation software program. this program provides estimation of tcid 50 of titres, and its 95% confidence limits, based on the one-hit model [18] .we have previously reported on the development of a formalin inactivated, whole virus influenza vaccine which was produced using large-scale serum protein free vero cell fermenter cultures [15] . this development of a candidate sars-cov vaccine was based on adaption of this well established technology, to establish optimal conditions for growth, inactivation and purification of the inactivated virus. the sars-cov had been reported to grow well on vero cells [2, 3] , so it was considered that this was probably the optimal cell matrix for rapid vaccine development. a primary virus seed was generated from a human isolate by five sequential plaque clonings. this primary seed was further amplified to generate a seed virus bank, a working virus bank and a production virus bank. the production virus was then used to infect serum protein free cultures using a fermenter volume of 100 l. following an incubation period of 2-3 days, the virus containing supernatant was then harvested and inactivated by 0.05% formalin treatment for 48 h followed by u.v. inactivation with an u.v. dose of 20 mj/cm 2 . virus infection at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.001 resulted in generation of high viral titres (∼10 8 tcid 50 /ml) in the supernatant and both the formalin and u.v. inactivation steps were independently capable of inactivating this titre with a large margin of safety (manuscript in preparation). following inactivation, the virus was then subjected to a two-step purification involving continuous flow zonal centrifugation over a 0-50% sucrose gradient followed by an ultra/diafiltration process. the results of this two-step purification procedure are demonstrated in fig. 1 . two lots of purified vaccine were subjected to western blot analysis and stained with both a specific anti-s glycoprotein (fig. 1a) and anti-n antibodies (fig. 1b) . in addition the protein composition was analysed by staining with colloidal gold (fig. 1c) . these figures demonstrate that the final purified bulk vaccine is very pure and contains s protein and n protein bands at the equivalent molecular weights to the infectious virus particle prior to inactivation and purification. some cross-linking of these proteins was also seen in inactivated preparations. an electron micrograph of the purified inactivated preparation confirmed this data ( fig. 2) with virus particles being demonstrated to present well defined spikes on the virus membrane.the immunogenicity of the candidate vaccine was initially investigated in dose-finding and adjuvant studies performed in cd1 mice. for this purpose, groups of 10 mice were immunised twice with decreasing doses of the purified non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted vaccine at doses ranging from 1 g to 0.3 ng. to evaluate the effect of adjuvantation on the immunogenicity of the vaccine, a non-adjuvanted preparation and material adjuvanted with 0.05 and 0.2% aluminium hydroxide was tested at each antigen concentration. the s specific antibody titre and neutralising antibody titre for each individual serum was then determined as described in sections 2.5 and 2.6. the geometric mean titre (gmt) determined for each group of animals is presented in fig. 3 . these data demonstrate that the candidate vaccine is highly immunogenic in cd1 mice. following a single immunisation with 1 or 0.2 g, s specific antibody titres with gmt up to approximately 1:5000 for the adjuvanted formulations and 1:1000 for the non-adjuvanted formulation were measured 2 weeks after the primary immunisation (data not shown). neutralising antibody titres were not measured at this time point. following the booster immunisation, elisa titres were substantially increased and gmts of up to 1:400,000 could be obtained with the 1 g dosage adjuvanted with 0.2% aluminium hydroxide. reduction of the dosage to as little as 0.3 ng in an adjuvanted formulation still resulted in the development of a low titre antibody response (fig. 3a) . high titre neutralising antibodies (approximately 1:1000) were also measured for the 0.2 g adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted formulations 3 weeks after the booster immunisation (fig. 3b) . groups of mice immunised with the 0.2% aluminium hydroxide formulations were bled 10 and 11 weeks after booster immunisation and it was demonstrated that high titre s specific and neutralising antibodies were still detected at this stage ( fig. 3c and d) .the influence of adjuvant on s specific antibody responses was also determined by calculating the effective dose 50 (e.d. 50 ), i.e. the minimum amount of antigen required for seroconversion in 50% of mice after two immunisations. the data in table 1a demonstrates that following a booster immunisation the non-adjuvanted and the vaccine containing 0.2% alum induced a very similar antibody response; e.d. 50 values of 1.1 and 0.8 ng, respectively, were obtained for non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted (0.2% alum) vaccines. the vaccine adjuvanted with 0.05% alum was somewhat more immunogenic. seventy percent of the mice developed specific antibodies against the s protein even at the lowest dose applied, i.e. 0.3 ng. due to the high proportion of seroconverters the e.d. 50 could not be exactly calculated, but it fig. 3 . s-specific and neutralising antibody response against sars-cov vaccine of cd1 mice after booster immunisation. the s-specific antibody titre at week 4 (a) or 12 (c), respectively, was determined by elisa. neutralising antibody response of cd1 mice at week 5 (b) or week 13 (d), respectively, was analysed by a micro neutralisation assay. geometric mean titres of groups that received the non-adjuvanted vaccine (grey bars), or vaccine adjuvanted with 0.05% (black bars) or 0.2% aluminium hydroxide (open bars) are presented (n = 10 for antibody titres; n = 4 for neutralising titres); ( ) no neutralising antibodies detectable (due to limited amount of serum in some instances the detection limit of the assay was at 1:57 or 1:71). was <0.1 ng. the proportion of animals which demonstrated a neutralising antibody titre was also analysed in a subset of immunised mice (n = 4, and the e.d. 50 based on neutralising antibody response was also calculated (table 1b) . this data was similar to that obtained for elisa igg determinations but differed somewhat in that the highest proportion of animals with neutralising antibodies were seen in the adjuvanted formulation with the highest concentration of alum (0.2%).further characterisation of the immune responses in mice was carried out by investigating specific cytokine responses to vaccination. the type of immune response was determined by measurement of interferon-␥, a marker for th-1 responses and interleukin-4 which is a marker for a th-2 response. for cytokine studies balb/c mice were immunised s.c. with 1 g of antigen adjuvanted with 0.2% alum. booster injections with the same formulation were given 14 and 28 days post primary immunisation. mice were sacrificed 21 and 35 days after the primary immunisation. spleen cells were isolated from balb/c mice and stimulated with a purified recombinant s protein or candidate vaccine (see sections 2.3.2 and 2.7). the data presented in fig. 4 shows that substantial ifn-␥ and il-4 responses were obtained after two immunisations with whole virus vaccine. however, the responses to the whole virus vaccine were substantially higher than those obtained following stimulation with recombinant s protein, after two immunisations. following a third immunisation, the il-4 response to recombinant s protein was increased to the level obtained for whole virus antigen, whereas no significant ifn-␥ response could still be detected upon stimulation with recombinant s protein. in addition, it could be demonstrated that as little as 0.1 g/ml of whole virus antigen was sufficient to stimulate substantial th-1 (ifn-␥) and th-2 (il-4) responses.following the demonstration that the candidate vaccine was highly immunogenic, the protective efficacy of the vaccine was investigated in cd1 mice. a subset (i.e. four mice per group) of cd1 mice immunised during dose-finding and adjuvant studies (see above) were challenged 5 or 13 weeks post primary immunisation by intranasal delivery of 10 5 tcid 50 of homologous virus strain. virus replication in the respiratory tract was monitored as described in section 2.4. the data presented in table 2 demonstrates again that the non-adjuvanted vaccine and vaccine preparations adjuvanted with 0.05% aluminium hydroxide were highly effective in inducing specific anti-s antibodies and neutralising antibodies. an antigen dose as low 8 ng with or without adjuvant was effective in inducing neutralising antibodies in 3 of 4 or 4 of 4 immunised animals, respectively.challenge with 10 5 tcid 50 of live virus resulted in virus replication in the lung of 100% of mock immunised mice. however, immunisation with candidate vaccine antigen doses as low as 8 ng resulted in a high degree of protection of vaccinated mice (3 of 4 and 4 of 4 animals protected). reduced doses of antigen still resulted in partial protection with ≥50% of immunised mice being protected following immunisation with 1.6 ng of vaccine antigen. similar data were obtained for vaccine preparations adjuvanted with 0.2% aluminium hydroxide (data not shown). the 50% protective dose (p.d. 50 ) was calculated for all three vaccine formulations and were shown to be approximately equal with p.d. 50 's of 1.4, 0.7 and 1.0 ng being calculated for formulations without adjuvant, with 0.05% alum and 0.2% alum, respectively (table 3) .the data presented in table 2 indicated that there was a clear correlation between specific igg titre against s protein, p.i.: post inoculation. s-specific antibody titres were measured by elisa, neutralising antibody titres (nt) by a micro neutralisation assay and sars-cov titres of homogenised lung/trachea tissue were determined by a tcid 50 assay and are given as log(tcid 50 /g lung tissue).neutralising antibody titre and protection against intra-nasal challenge with live virus. this data was confirmed by summarising all protection data obtained in the mouse model. table 4 summarises the data obtained for a total of 168 mice used in various immunisation studies during the course of this development. the data in table 4a demonstrates that a specific anti-s igg titre of ≥25,600 resulted in 100% protection of mice challenged with 10 5 tcid 50 of live virus. it was also demonstrated that a specific neutralising titre ≥114 resulted in 100% protection against challenge (table 4b) . no virus replication was seen in mice with antibody titres above these levels. in contrast, 89% of the control animals were infected by intranasal challenge with 10 5 tcid 50 of live virus.this report describes the extensive immunological characterisation of a candidate sars coronavirus vaccine. a number of different strategies have previously been reported for the development of experimental and candidate human sars vaccines. these include inactivated whole virus vaccines [19] [20] [21] , attenuated viral vectors expressing sars-cov proteins [7, 8, 12, 13] and dna vaccines [14, 22] . we have favoured the strategy of a whole virus vaccine development for a number of reasons, including speed of development. the virus grows to very high titres in vero cells, a cell line accepted by most regulatory authorities. a similar technology used for this development has been utilised for development and industrial scale production of an influenza virus vaccine [15] . manufacturing facilities are also in place at the appropriate biosafety level to utilise this technology for rapid large scale vaccine production. however, in addition to these technology and logistical reasons, it is also likely that an inactivated whole virus vaccine would be most efficient in inducing neutralising antibodies, which are possibly critical in preventing sars-cov infection.most processes for inactivated whole virus vaccines have utilised either formaldehyde or ␤-propiolactone as an inactivating agent. there have been reports of inactivation failures associated with both of these methodologies even in the recent past [23] . we have therefore developed a strategy involving a double inactivation process utilising formaldehyde and u.v. inactivations. although formaldehyde is reported to react with protein and nucleic acid the reactions with nucleic acid, particularly when the nucleic acid is a component of a virus particle, are less well established. therefore we have decided to introduce a second inactivation step in addition to formaldehyde, i.e. u.v. inactivation, directed primarily against nucleic acid. both of these processes were independently demonstrated to be capable of inactivating >10 8 tcid 50 /ml with a large margin of safety (manuscript in preparation).however, it was also essential to demonstrate that this combination of inactivation steps did not destroy the viral antigenic structure and immunogenicity. the data presented in fig. 1 demonstrates that the major virus antigens, i.e. the s glycoprotein and n protein were not negatively effected. no additional breakdown products could be detected compared to the non-inactivated preparation. in addition, transmission electron microscopy analysis of uranyl acetate stained samples demonstrated that the inactivated virion presented welldefined spike structures on the virus particle with no apparent structural alterations resulting from the inactivation procedures.these antigenic and structural analyses were then followed up with an extensive immunological characterisation of the candidate vaccine. dose finding and adjuvant studies were carried out in mice with measurement of antibody responses by s specific elisa and infectivity neutralising titres. the data presented in fig. 3 demonstrated that the double inactivated preparation was highly immunogenic with s specific elisa titres of up to 1:400,000 being obtained following two immunisations with 1 g antigen adjuvanted with 0.2% aluminum hydroxide. high neutralising titres were also obtained following an immunisation and booster with 0.2 g antigen, with titres of approximately 1:1000 being obtained. this immunogenicity appears to be higher than that reported for other whole virus vaccines subjected to a single inactivation step, although differences in methodologies make direct comparisons difficult [20, 21] . the double inactivated vaccine was also able to induce very high antibody responses even in the absence of adjuvant. this is similar to data reported for an u.v. inactivated vaccine [21] and for a ␤propiolactone inactivated vaccine [20] where little difference in the level of neutralising antibodies in mice was reported. the minimal influence of adjuvantation on vaccine immunogenicity was also confirmed in these studies by calculation of the e.d. 50 . there was little difference in e.d. 50 of the non-adjuvanted and 0.2% alum adjuvanted material although the 0.05% alum adjuvanted material appeared to be more immunogenic (table 1a) . however, this was not confirmed when the e.d. 50 was calculated on the basis of neutralising antibody responses, with the non-adjuvanted material being more immunogenic than the preparation with 0.05% alum (table 1b) .in addition to characterisation of humoral responses by antibody measurement, the th-1 and th-2 responses to immunisation were analysed by cytokine production. the data presented in fig. 4 demonstrated that the double inactivated candidate vaccine was capable of inducing cytokine markers for both th-1 and th-2 responses. however, the responses to stimulation with recombinant s protein indicated that t cell responses to the s protein were predominantly th-2 responses, which would be expected for an alum adjuvanted whole virus vaccine [24] . this is in agreement with data reported for immunisation with uv-inactivated sars-cov which demonstrated substantial il-4 and ifn-␥ responses to immunisation [21] .following demonstration of the immunogenicity of the vaccine, investigations were then initiated to demonstrate the efficacy of the candidate vaccine in preventing infection in a small animal model. balb/c mice have been established as a good rodent model for the replications of sars co-v [25] . we have demonstrated that the virus replicated very well in the respiratory tract of cd1 mice and this model was used to investigate the protective efficacy of the vaccine. the data in table 2 demonstrates that both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted vaccine preparations at an antigen concentration of 0.2 g protected 100% of immunised mice from challenge with high titre (10 5 tcid 50 ) virus by the intra-nasal route. the vaccine appeared to be effective at very low doses of antigen: calculation of the p.d. 50 (table 3) for non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted vaccines confirmed that very low antigen concentrations (approximately 1 ng) were sufficient to provide protection of 50% of immunised mice. this figure is even lower than that calculated for highly effective well-established flavivirus vaccines such as tick-borne encephalitis which has a calculated p.d. 50 of 32 ng in a similar model. ( [26] , unpublished data).these protection studies were also used to establish a serological correlate of protection. the data in table 4 demonstrate that induction of neutralising antibody titres ≥114 and a s specific elisa titre of ≥25,600 resulted in 100% protection against intra-nasal challenge with 10 5 tcid 50 of infectious virus.these data clearly indicate that a double inactivated whole virus vaccine is a promising candidate for an effective human vaccine. the use of two inactivation steps based on different mechanisms of infection will ensure safety with respect to residual infectious virus. however, it has been reported that vaccination with a feline coronavirus vaccine resulted in antibody induced enhancement of infection [27, 28] . no suggestion of such a phenomenon could be induced from the challenge studies reported here or in other studies where protection was achieved by induction of neutralising antibodies with mva [13] or parainfluenza [8] vectored spike protein live viral vaccines. however, vaccine induced enhancement of coronavirus infection will require further study as there have been reports that vaccination of ferrets with rmva expressing sars-cov s protein was associated with enhanced hepatitis [29, 30] .the epidemic of coronavirus infection covid-19 was first reported in the wuhan city of china, and later, it has spread rapidly throughout china along with other countries, following a pandemic. on 30 january 2020,the world health organization (who) declared a public health emergency of international concern considering the quick outbreak of the disease [1].to date, a total of 10,719,946 confirmed cases and 517,337 deaths have been reported by who. infected patients develop symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea, decreased leukocyte counts, etc. [2] [3] [4] . the established mode of transmission for this disease is through physical contact by any of the following means: cough, sneezes, and respiratory droplets [5] [6] [7] .the virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), earlier known as novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), is the pathogenic identity for covid-19 [8] [9] [10] . it is an enveloped virus consisting of positive-strand rna as the genomic component [11] . the virus has a characteristic of crown-like appearance due to the spike glycoprotein on the viral envelope [12] . spike glycoprotein could be the most suitable target for drug designing, vaccine development, and immunotherapy because of its outer surface localization. all the selected epitopes were either predicted or validated in the human immunological framework model. such an approach could provide a practical method for designing and developing vaccine candidates against the sars-cov-2. initially, the selection of the desired antigens or considering specific proteins as immunogens is a challenging job. therefore, the epitopebased vaccine design, in silico cloning and validation, can allow the evaluation of a particular vaccine for its novelty and effectiveness in a given time frame.recently, we have proposed an epitope-based in silico peptide vaccine against the sars-cov-2 [13] . herein, we have tried to perform in silico characterizations and validations of these identified epitopes. an understanding of the allergenic nature is a must for the safety and effectiveness of any vaccine. thus, we analyzed the allergenicity of the constructed vaccine candidate and verified whether these epitopes are feasible for developing a robust vaccine against sars-cov-2. moreover, molecular docking was performed in a web-based docking server, and molecular dynamic simulation was executed to compare and validate the interactions between receptor-ligand complex. additionally, codon adaptation and in-silico cloning were designed for future amplification of targeted vaccine into the expression vector as per requirement. collectively, this in silico validation has tried to prove the effectiveness of the developed vaccine candidate with identified epitopes to control the sars-cov-2 infection.the multi-epitopes of the sars-cov-2 spike protein were selected and retrieved from our previously published work [13] . these epitopes were used to construct a vaccine, and a similar methodology has been employed here for analyzing the effectiveness of the proposed vaccine candidate.the novel vaccine should be non-allergenic for its compelling performance. here, two servers allertop and allergenfp, were used for allergenicity assessment of our vaccine candidate [14, 15] . both the servers rely on the principle of auto cross-covariance (acc) and allergenic evaluation methods. these two methods utilize the physicochemical properties of amino acid residues.molecular docking analysis was performed to study the stable protein-protein interaction and related sub-cellular functions. for molecular docking, the cluspro 2.0: protein-protein docking server was used [16] . in the cluspro server, the rigid body docking phase uses the piper docking program, which relies on the fast fourier transform (fft) correlation approach. piper represents the interaction energy between two proteins using an expression of form e;where, e rep and e attr denote the attractive and repulsive contributions to the van der waals interaction energy, and e elec is electrostatic energy. e dars is a pairwise structure-based potential; it primarily represents desolvation contributions, i.e., free energy change by removal of the water molecules from the interface.the coefficients w 1, w 2, w 3 , and w 4 define the weights of the corresponding residues.for the analysis and display of molecular assemblies of the tlr4/5 proteins and vaccine component complex, the visual molecular dynamics (vmd 1.8.3.) program was utilized [17] .the root mean square fluctuation (rmsf) is calculated for c-α atoms, and root mean square deviations (rmsd) of total protein is selected against the backbone c-α atom of the protein complex. applying the present force field, we completed a 10 ps (pico-second) unrestrained md simulation of the acid-unfolded state of tlr4/5 proteins and vaccine candidate complex.primarily the magnitude within the state-of-the-art simulation can define the structural and dynamical features of the studied protein [18] .normal mode analysis mobility allowed us to investigate the large-scale mobility and the stability of macromolecules. the imods server performed the internal coordinates analysis based on the protein-protein structural complex [19] . the server calculates a specific combined motion of large macro-molecule along with the nma of dihedral coordinates of cα atoms. additionally, imods estimates b-factor (a disorder of an atom in a protein), structural deformability, and computes the eigenvalue.due to the dissimilarity between the codons of human and e. coli, codon adaptation tools were used. it is necessary to adapt the codon usage within the prokaryotic organism to boost the expression rate in the respective eukaryotic system. for the cloning of the vaccine component, e. coli strain k12 was selected as a host. the java codon adaptive tool (jcat) was employed for codon optimization of our vaccine component [20] . here, we selected the pet28a (+) expression vector for cloning, and its nucleotides sequences were collected from the 'addgene' vector database [21] . the webdsvver 2.0 (http://www.molbiotools.com/webdsv/) was used for pursuing the in-silico cloning of peptidebased vaccine component against sars-cov-2. solubility and physicochemical property assessments of the primary sequence of vaccine candidates are essential for determining the state, stability, and accessibility of a vaccine. the solubility of the construct vaccine was predicted against the average solubility of e. coli protein in the protein-sol webserver [22] . the protparam server was accessed for further analysis of various physicochemical properties of the designed vaccine candidate [23] .we (table 1) .both (figure-1) . the probable immune cascade mechanism of the vaccine candidate in the tirap receptor protein has been depicted in figure-2 [24] .the molecular dynamic simulation of tlr4/5 proteins and the vaccine candidate was performed by the visual molecular dynamics (vmd 1.8.3.) program, and it produced 700 frames (100 frame= 5000 ts= 10 ps) and rmsd plot (figure 3 a, b) . rmsf was calculated for c-α atoms, and in rmsd, total protein was selected against the backbone of c-α. the plot displayed that the protein complex was in a steady-state. in silico cloning is a rapid method to assess the possibility of developing a potent multi- the sars-cov-2 has become a global concern and is rapidly emerging as a threat to human civilization. covid-19, as a pandemic, has already caused many deaths around the globe and still is affecting the human population at a rapid rate. hence, the new therapeutic approach by targeting tlrs (tlr4/tlr5) modulation may serve as a better choice for vaccine or adjuvant development against the infection of sars-cov-2 [26] .kaur et al., developed a multi-epitope peptide-based chimeric vaccine against the taeniasolium by in silico approaches [26] . the structural vaccinological analysis and computational validation of the vaccine candidate were also performed against the mayaro virus [27] . in considerate to the human pathogenic viruses (west nile virus and ebola virus) specific peptide-based vaccine has been developed by employing immuno-pharmacoinformatic techniques [28, 29] .the principal focus of our current study was the in silico evaluation of potent vaccine candidates from identified common epitopes. primarily, we have chosen 16 common b-cell and t-cell epitopes from our previous published work [13] . afterward, an analysis of the allergenic property was carried out on the designed vaccine candidate. safe efficacy is a prerequisite for a vaccine, for successful human administration [30] . from the analysis in the allertop and allergenfp servers, it was found that the constructed vaccine candidate is non-allergenic and safe for future in vivo and in vitro work. further, molecular docking of vaccine candidates with tlr proteins was performed in the cluspro 2.0 server to compare and validate the accuracy, stable protein-protein binding, and molecular interactions [31, 32] . it was observed that the molecular docking was significant with a high negative energy value (lowest energy value -1362.3kcal/mol) of the top ordered protein-protein docking complex [33, 34] . the molecular dynamics simulation based refinement of the tlr4/tlr5 and vaccine candidate protein complex established the fact that the conformational model was in a steady state. the residues in the protein complex accelerated conformation transitions among the local energy state in 700 frames (5000 ts=10 ps), time against distance trajectory. the mobility of the protein complex formed by molecular docking was justified through the normal mode analysis mobility study [35] . outputs of the normal mode analysis study using imods revealed that both tlr4/tlr5and vaccine candidates have stable interaction movement towards each other upon molecular binding.additionally, the complex was not easily deformable as there were significantly lower peaks in the deformability plot. furthermore, codon adaptation within the prokaryotic system was analyzed to obtain a better adaptation and high expression profile in a eukaryotic expression system. when the construct vaccine candidate was cloned into the pet28 (+) expression vector with the help of webdsvver 2.0, higher expression of the cloned codons was projected.the pi value predicted in the protparam tool indicates the essential (cation rich) character of the vaccine candidate. the prediction also helps to compute the stability of the vaccine into the host body. an aliphatic index of 61.03 predicted that the vaccine is thermostable while the instability index lower than 40 (16.60) indicated higher stability of the vaccine structure after expression.our in silico work reveals that the proposed vaccine candidate is non-allergenic, and has efficient as well as stable molecular interaction with the tlr proteins of humans. results also indicate a high potential and effectiveness of the selected epitopes against sars-cov-2. the codon adaptation and in silico cloning established the impending amplification ability of the vaccine construct within the expression vector as per the conditional requirement. furthermore, our in silico analysis might be encouraging to the researchers who are trying to develop efficient therapy against covid-19. however, constructed vaccine candidates will require successive laboratory validation in in vitro and in vivo models.not applicable.all data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.not applicable. since the identification of a novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2, as the cause of pneumonia in patients from wuhan china, a pandemic has erupted, resulting in enormous health care, social and economic disruption to our global society [1] . as of may 17, 2020 there have been 4,708,415 cases and 314,950 deaths worldwide [2] . in rapid response to the pandemic, academic and industry scientists from around the world have initiated efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics for disease prevention and patient management. the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi), a global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organizations, is funding work to develop sars-cov-2 vaccines using a variety of technology platforms. several vaccine candidates are already in phase 1 studies with others likely to enter the clinic in the next few months [3] .one of the challenges facing rapid vaccine development for sars-cov-2 is the need to adequately assure the safety of these vaccines. one such safety concern is disease enhancement syndrome that occurred in the 1960s with inactivated rsv and measles vaccines. vaccinemediated disease enhancement is characterized by a vaccine that results in increased disease severity if the subject is later infected by the natural virus. during early trials with inactivated rsv vaccine, the vaccine did not prevent infection, 80% of those infected required hospitalization and two children died [4] . lung pathology in patients showed an unexpected inflammatory response with both neutrophils and eosinophils, evidence of immune complex formation and complement activation in small airways [5] . scientists later learned that the vaccine caused a similar disease enhancement in animals characterized by immunopathology and a t helper cell type 2 (th2) biased response and antibody responses with poor neutralizing activity [6] [7] [8] . since that time, the animal models have been relied upon to predict safety for new 6 rsv vaccines that are developed. of note, the pathogenesis of rsv disease enhancement is distinct from antibody disease enhancement (ade) which occurs for macrophage tropic viruses,   demonstrated most notably for dengue in humans and the coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus in cats, and is directly caused by non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing antibodies leading to more efficient viral uptake via fcγ receptor binding [9] .since pathology consistent with the rsv vaccine enhanced disease (and perhaps ade) has been demonstrated for some sars-cov-1 vaccine candidates in animal models, there is also a concern that a similar syndrome could occur in humans immunized with sars-cov-2 candidate vaccines. therefore, cepi and the brighton collaboration safety platform for emergency vaccines (speac) convened a scientific working meeting https://brightoncollaboration.us/brighton-collaboration-cepi-covid-19-web-conference/) on march 12 and 13, 2020 of experts in the field of vaccine immunology and coronaviruses to discuss current knowledge that could form the basis for the assessment of the risk of enhanced disease during sars-cov-2 vaccine development. this consensus report presents considerations for vaccine developers and can serve as a guide for the development and testing of vaccine candidates to avoid these safety concerns. ultimately, the door to clinical trials is controlled by regulators in the context of the risk/benefit for the entire dataset provided by developers and within the local trial context. microbiology and immunology and pediatrics at the university of iowa, both reviewed their work and that of others in animal models developed for sars-cov-1 and mers-cov. the lessons from these models can inform the development priorities for useful sars-cov-2 animal models to address both efficacy and safety.in inbred mouse strains, sars-cov-1 replicates efficiently in the respiratory tract and can cause pneumonitis, but clinical signs and pneumonia were only observed in old balb/c mice [10] . subsequent passage of sars-cov-1 through mouse lungs resulted in the isolation of virus that caused severe disease in both young and old mice [11, 12] . this virus was used in many subsequent studies. ferret models of sars-cov-1 also demonstrate virus replication in respiratory tracts with induction of a neutralizing antibody response but also demonstrated little evidence of clinical disease [13] . hamsters, in contrast to mice and ferrets, demonstrate high levels of viral replication, develop pneumonitis, and can be shown to have clinical signs of disease [14] . following the identification of human ace2 as the receptor for sars-cov-1, transgenic murine models expressing human ace2 receptor (hace2) were developed and shown to develop mild pulmonary disease. of note, these mice also developed lethal viral encephalitis, attributed to viral spread through the olfactory nerve, despite the relative scarcity of hace2 expression in the brain which may have relevance to sars-cov-2 disease [15] .efficacy of several sars-cov-1 vaccines was evaluated in these models with spike (s) protein based vaccines demonstrating neutralizing antibody and protection against pulmonary replication of the challenge virus in mice and hamsters [16] . for dna vaccine studies, it was shown that candidate vaccines encoding the s protein conferred antibody mediated protection from challenge in mice and that vaccines encoding the n protein induced humoral and cellular immunity [17, 18] . for vectored vaccines expressing sars-cov-1 proteins, it was shown that 8 viral proteins were expressed in mice, ferrets, and hamsters. in these studies, neutralizing antibodies were elicited by b/hpiv3, vsv, rabies, mva and adeno viruses expressing s protein, that protected against sars-cov-1 replication in lungs of challenged animals.however, one mva vaccine expressing the s-protein did not protect against infection [16] .in contrast to sars-cov-1, inbred mice were found to be resistant to mers-cov, thus infection was studied by creating models that expressed the mers receptor, human dpp4(hdpp4). ad5-hdpp4 transduced mice could be infected with mers virus but infection was associated with minimal clinical disease except in immunocompromised mice that developed weight loss after infection. of note, hdpp4-transgenic mice developed lethal viral encephalitis with concurrent inflammatory changes on histopathological examination of the lung, similar to hace2-tg mice with sars-cov-1. subsequently, investigators developed mice "knocked-in"for expression of hdpp4 and after virus passage in these mice, identified mouse-adapted mers strains that caused more severe disease and increased histopathology with more pulmonary edema than those infected with the original mers strain [19] . importantly, mice without functional t cells, such as rag1-/-and tcr alpha-/-, had delayed viral clearance whereas mice that could not produce antibodies, mumt mice, did not show delay in clearance. similar models were developed by crispr/cas9 mutagenesis of two residues in the mouse ace2 molecule, followed by mouse adaptation with serial passage, leading to an ards model of lethal infection [20, 21] . taken together this evidence supports the notion that t cells are important in viral clearance for mers [22] .non-human primate (nhp) models have also been established for both sars-cov-1 and mers-cov. there was evidence of upper respiratory and lower respiratory tract sars-cov-1 replication in african green monkeys to a greater extent than in cynomolgus macaques, and least 9 in rhesus macaques, with little evidence of clinical disease in all three species [23] . of note, consistent with findings in older humans and mice, increased pathology has been documented in aged cynomolgus macaques with sars-cov-1 wild type infection [24] . there is some controversy on the disease severity in the mers models with different groups seeing different levels of pathology. this has not been resolved [25, 26] .both vaccine efficacy and safety have been studied in animal models with many sars-cov-1 candidate vaccines. the group of experts discussed how the vaccine models were utilized to characterize the response of specific vaccines and to examine both disease enhancement and antibody dependent enhancement (ade) signals.there is evidence for disease enhancement in vaccinated animals after challenge with live virus in multiple studies with sars-cov-1 vaccine candidates as summarized in table. we are limiting our comments in this report to data in animal models and not discussing in vitro data except to mention that there is some evidence of ade in human primary monocytes [27, 28] .different animal models exhibit different pulmonary pathology but generally characterized by cellular infiltrates including eosinophils. in this summary, we provide an overview of the consensus opinion on vaccine related outcomes in animal models that were of concern for risk of disease enhancement and could guide assessments of sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates.in murine models, evidence for vaccine related disease enhancement has been demonstrated for inactivated whole vaccine (with and without alum), vectored vaccine expressing n protein (but not seen with vectored vaccine expressing s protein in same report), a replicon particle platform expressing s protein, and a vectored vaccine expressing s proteins. in general, the pathology described included pulmonary infiltrates often with eosinophils observed.th2 dominant responses were documented in some reports by expression of th2 driven cytokines [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . in a ferret model, hepatitis was demonstrated in animals vaccinated with a recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing s protein and then challenged with virus [34] although questions have been raised about this study [35] . [36, 37] .non-human primate models have also produced evidence of enhanced disease after sars-cov-1 vaccine immunization. chinese macaques immunized with a modified vaccinia virus expressing s protein then challenged with sars-cov-1 did not develop clinical disease, but histopathology showed lung injury. this injury was characterized by decreased wound healing, and increased pro-inflammatory macrophages expressing il-6, il-8, and ccl2 [38] .this report also demonstrated that passively administered anti-s antibody was associated with lung pathology after challenge with the live virus although the mechanism may not be through fc receptor and thus not classic "ade". of note, a second report similarly demonstrates the effect with certain anti-s antibody preparations and without fc involvement [39, 40] . the relevance of these reports remains unclear as there are multiple studies with administration of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to different models that did not induce disease enhancement.other investigators have reported absence of disease enhancement in both hamsters and monkeys immunized with a whole inactivated vaccine although these models differed in a number of ways, most notably by the use of bpl (β-propiolactone) instead of formalin for inactivation of the virus [41, 42] . finally, we note that there has not be an agreed upon positive control applied in these animal studies and thus interpretations are hampered.baanimal models with sars-cov-2 are being rapidly developed by multiple research human ace2 transgenic mice (hace2 tg) aged 4-6 weeks and 6-11 months of age were studied and hace2 expression was observed in lung, heart, kidney and intestinal tissues.following intranasal inoculation with sars-cov-2, weight loss was observed, and viral rna was detected in the lungs as well as in the intestine [43] .gross pathology demonstrated swollen and enlarged lungs with moderate interstitial pneumonia. histological studies documented an accumulation of inflammatory cells including monocytes and lymphocytes in alveolar interstitium, with thickening of alveolar walls. sars-cov-2 s protein was detected by ihc in alveolar macrophages and epithelia [43] .nhp were also infected with sars-cov-2 with 3 rhesus macaques aged 3-4 years inoculated intratracheally and although no fever was observed, weight loss and asthenia were seen on multiple days. viral rna was detected from nasal and throat swabs and to a lesser degree in anal specimens, peaking on days 3 to 7 and lasting until day 11 post infection. one animal was euthanized on day 7 for necropsy and viral rna was detected in multiple organs including cns, skeletal muscle and heart. for the two surviving rhesus macaques, positive neutralization titers were documented by day 11 post infection. there was radiographic evidence of multiple ground glass opacities in the lungs on days 3, 5 and 7 post infection. microscopically the lung lesions represented an acute interstitial pneumonia characterized by mild to moderate thickening of alveolar septum, increased number of macrophages, degeneration of pneumocytes and an inflammatory cell infiltration. presence of viral antigen was confirmed, predominately in alveolar monocytes and macrophages [44] . analysis of blood samples showed a decline in counts of total white blood cells, lymphocytes and monocytes with no observed changes in 13 percentages. a decrease in both cd3+cd4+ and cd3+ cd8+ t-cell counts was observed.importantly, these hematological findings are similar to those seen in sars-cov-2 infected patients.this model could serve as a critical tool for detailed studies of pathogenesis and the evaluation of intervention strategies including vaccines. of note, following the meeting another group has confirmed sars-cov-2 infection in rhesus macaques with viral antigen detected in type i and type ii pneumocytes and diffuse pulmonary alveolar damage noted [45] . experts agreed that these models and others under development should be utilized to evaluate vaccine candidates for any evidence of disease enhancement as specified in later sections.design barney the sars-cov-2 s protein structure was solved shortly after its emergence and shows similar structure and mobility as the sars-cov-1 s [47] . the timing from first knowledge of sars-cov-2 to the beginning of the phase 1 study was a remarkable sixty-five days. the advantages of mrna vaccines include ability to create a highly precise type of protein to elicit the correct antibodies, to elicit t cell responses that are th1 predominant, and the rapidity of manufacturing. of course, disadvantages include the novel nature of both mrna and dna vaccines without any licensed vaccine with either technology to date and lack of experience for mass production. therefore, multiple platforms for sars-cov-2 are under development that mitigate against some of the potential disadvantages of nucleic acid vaccines.although mrna and dna vaccines elicit t cell responses without adjuvants, adjuvants may be important for subunit and whole cell inactivated vaccines to increase their immunogenicity and drive an immune response that could limit the risk of disease enhancement.multiple sars-cov-2 vaccines are in development including vectored vaccines, whole cell inactivated vaccines, and recombinant protein vaccines. the experts discussed how the choice of adjuvants will be important for both efficacy and safety with these platforms.dr. arnaud didierlaurent from the centre of vaccinology at the university of geneva presented background on the effects of different adjuvants on animal and human immune responses. several adjuvants are now being used in commercial vaccines or are in clinical development [48] . oil-in-water emulsions such as mf59 or as03 have been shown to increase the breadth of the antibody repertoire, binding affinity and affinity maturation when compared to unadjuvanted vaccines [49, 50] in human studies with influenza vaccines, h5n1 vaccine adjuvanted with mf59 (squalene-based emulsion) increased the levels of h5-specific antibody for subclasses igg1 and igg3 and the binding to fcγr2 but not to fcγr3 when compared to alum adjuvanted vaccines. this demonstrates that the use of an adjuvant can skew the functionality profile of antigen-specific antibodies, with the potential to activate different innate effectors based on their fcγr expression [51] . use of squalene-based emulsion vaccines for influenza have also been shown to increase cd4+ t cell response frequencies and crossreactivity. even if pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies are present prior to immunization, such adjuvants could activate naïve b cells and promote the adaptability of memory b cells [52] [53] [54] [55] .in addition to antibodies, adjuvants can promote cellular responses. human malaria challenge studies provided early evidence that the choice of adjuvants(combined with the malaria antigen rts,s) was critical in achieving optimal protection and highlighted the importance of cellular response [56] . more recently, studies with hepatitis b surface antigen (hbs) vaccine adjuvanted with as01, as03, as04 or alum showed that vaccines formulated with as01 and as03 induced the highest antibody levels while as01 promoted best hbs-specific cd4 t cell response [57] . these differences were associated with the magnitude of the initial inflammatory 18 response triggered by the different adjuvanted formulations [57, 58] . interestingly, although the level of cd4 t cell response was lower in the alum group compared to the as01 group, both adjuvants led to similar memory subset profiles and cytokine production profiles given the unprecedented demand for an effective vaccine, the use of adjuvants may be critical for subunit vaccines in providing antigen-dose sparing, increased immunogenicity, breadth and duration of response, potentially eliciting cross-protection against new cov strains and minimizing the risk of enhanced disease.following the presentations, attendees participated in discussion of the suggested consensus statements and all attendees were asked to comment on the draft statements available online. these comments were reviewed and discussed again on the second day of the meeting and resulted in the summary consensus statement that follows.• sars-cov-2 has a low affinity for murine ace2 receptor and murine models will require the use of hace2 transgenic mice, preferably with a 'knock-in' approach.preliminary data indicate the possibility of infecting hace2 transgenic mice with demonstration of viral replication and mild lung lesions. mouse adaptation of sars-cov-2, as done with sars-cov-1, will likely be required to obtain a virus that causes more severe disease in mice. models that develop acute lung injury with some lethality and that mimic the human condition will be important for evaluating vaccine safety.• previous studies from sars-cov-1 and mers-cov indicated that some vaccines, especially those using whole inactivated virus, could enhance the disease induced in mice challenged with sars-cov-1 or mers-cov. the lung lesions were highly inflammatory, with a dominance of eosinophil infiltration and occurred in animals despite 20 presence of a neutralizing antibody response and reduced challenge virus replication in the lungs. such studies have not yet been completed for sars-cov2.• in mice, this immunopathology was considered a consequence of a dominant th2 type response to the vaccine antigens. it was not seen after including adjuvants (e.g. cpg) in the vaccine or other vaccine formulations known to drive immune responses towardsth1. the timing of challenge after vaccination may be critical. it would be of major interest to explore the outcome following challenge at later timepoints when antibodies are significantly decaying.• one should be aware of the potential confounding effect of cell-culture excipients in the vaccine and challenge strain material. it is known that impurities such as fetal calf serum in the preclinical vaccine preparation may induce eosinophil influx in any mouse model if the challenge strain also contains the same excipients.• in these models, characterization of the immune response to the candidate vaccine (e.g., igg isotypes, th2 markers) may have some predictive value.• other small animal models which can be infected by sars-cov-2 can be considered (e.g. ferret, hamster). development of small animal models of severe disease will also inform studies of vaccine-enhanced disease. • passive transfer in nhps of human antibodies generated during phase 1 trials, followed by viral challenge could be considered to assess the risk of disease enhancement.• challenge of immunized animals with a closely related heterologous cov strains may assess the risk of enhancement during future outbreaks.• in case of disease enhancement, in-depth studies in animal models may give some indications on the mechanism of immunopathology. they can inform human trial designers on the critical immunological risk markers to be monitored in phase 1 trials. • given what will be the unprecedented demand for an effective vaccine, the use of adjuvants may be critical for sub-unit vaccines in providing increased immunogenicity, breadth of response, dose sparing, duration of response, potentially cross-protection against new cov strains, and possibly minimize the risk of enhanced disease. preference should be given to th1-driving adjuvants with an established safety profile in humans.• understanding of the role of cross-reacting antibodies from prior coronavirus infections may have on natural disease caused by sars-cov-2 or influence the risk of enhanced disease following vaccination may inform vaccine design.• data are needed on whether antibody waning could increase the risk of enhanced disease on exposure to virus in the long term.it was the opinion of the experts that animal data to support clinical development could address:• post-vaccination (neutralizing) antibody responses, and t cell analysis to demonstrate a th1 response.• post-vaccination challenge data from nhps with careful evaluation for immunopathology and quantitative virology in the animals.• small animal data may also provide important supporting evidence of safety, and hamster, ferret and mouse models are likely to be available for developers.• where possible, immunopathology experiments with a positive control (e.g., formalin inactivated alum-adjuvanted sars-cov-1 or sars-cov-2 vaccine) and a mockimmunized negative control will provide best guidance. it was felt that it will be important to establish broadly accepted endpoints and scoring systems to allow comparison of various vaccine candidates. who is working on this issue.• for vaccine constructs likely to induce a predominant th2 response, the group felt that animal studies should be considered before entering human phase 1 trials in more than one animal species including nhps where possible. it was noted that the absence of a th2 response does not eliminate the risk of enhanced disease. • since not all studies that have begun or are about to begin will prescreen to determine preimmunization serostatus of participants, although this shall be determined retrospectively, appropriate baseline blood specimens should be obtained and stored.because the virus is spreading rapidly, such specimens will allow assessment of the 25 immune response in both seronegative and seropositive persons as both are likely to be vaccinated.• level of neutralizing antibodies and determination of the relative ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies will be important to assess the potential risk of enhanced disease.also, detection of initial priming that includes cd8 t cells and/or a cd4 th1 biased response is likely to mitigate the risk of disease enhancement. determination of memory responses will be useful, particularly if sars-cov-2 continues to circulate.• consideration should be given to the use of post-vaccination sera from vaccinees which could be used for antibody transfer studies in animals to look for enhanced disease and for evidence of cross-protection against other coronaviruses.• monitoring for enhanced disease in immunized participants may require longer follow-up than is usual in phase 1 trials but need not delay phase 2 trials.• investigators on the call requested frequent updating with both preclinical and evolving clinical data that are being developed by the different academic and industrial developers to help in decision-making about the various vaccine clinical trials. creation of a central information hub was encouraged for this purpose.• participants on the call expressed the need for standardization of protocols, data collection forms, critical assays (including reagents) and biobanking of samples from initial clinical trials to allow future re-assay once standards are agreed to and enable comparison of results across trials 26 • the group of experts considers that the demonstration of some disease enhancement with any candidate vaccine after viral challenge in animal models should not necessarily represent a no-go signal for deciding whether to progress into early trials in clinical development of a covid-19 vaccine.• continuous monitoring of this risk during clinical trials in an epidemic context will be needed.• each observed effect should be discussed by the developers with their regulators who will ultimately define the actual requirements for clinical studies.the considerations in this document should be interpreted as general scientific remarks based on current knowledge to inform a research agenda that could be beneficial for vaccines in development. these considerations are not of a regulatory nature and cannot in any sense replace the need for proper regulatory consultations on the requirements for vaccines clinical trials. vaccine developers are therefore encouraged to seek individual scientific advice from regulatory authorities. severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is a severe respiratory illness caused by the sars coronavirus (sars-cov) [1] . the disease emerged in the guangdong province of china in late 2002 [2] and spread to 29 countries mostly within asia, although europe and north america were also affected, notably toronto, canada. the epidemic was finally controlled by july 2003 through strict implementation of prevalence for sars-cov antibody, although they had no history of sars-like disease. sars-cov-like viruses that were isolated from civets and raccoon dogs had more than 99% homology with human sars-cov, with major differences found in orf8, whose deletion has been suggested to represent a sign of adaptation to humans [12] . only four amino acid residues in the receptor glycoprotein ace2binding domain of the viral spike protein differ between the human epidemic sars-cov strains and civet strains, but they cause more than a 1000-fold difference in binding affinity to the ace2 molecule [13, 14] . although a high prevalence of sars-like coronaviruses were found in chinese horseshoe bats [15, 16] , their great genetic diversity makes it difficult to identify which one might be the ancestor of sars-cov and to decide with certainty whether bats indeed are the animal reservoir of the virus.sars-cov infection exhibits a wide clinical course characterized mostly by fever, dyspnea, lymphopenia and lower respiratory infection, often with concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea [17, 18] . pathology in sars patients has been associated with diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and multinucleated giant cell infiltrates of epithelial or macrophage origin, suggestive of syncytium-like formation in the lung. the virus can be recovered from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respiratory secretions, stools, urine and even sweat (for a review, see [19] ). sars vaccine development efforts were initiated very rapidly after the identification of the etiologic agent, even though the immune correlates of protection were not known. research efforts to identify protective antigens and to develop animal models were undertaken in parallel with efforts to develop candidate vaccines [20] , drawing on experience with animal coronavirus vaccines and using several vaccine strategies, including inactivated virus vaccines, purified subunit vaccines, plasmid dna and viral vector-based vaccines as well as virus-like particles. much effort has been made to identify appropriate animal models for sars-cov replication and pathogenesis. several research groups have shown that mice [21, 22] , ferrets [23] , hamsters [24] and nonhuman primates [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] support replication of sars-cov with varying degrees of associated disease.these animal models were used for the evaluation of candidate vaccines, and the common conclusion that has emerged from the evaluation of several vaccines is that the 180 kda viral spike protein, s, is the only significant neutralization antigen [31] [32] [33] [34] and the only one to elicit protective immunity in animal models [21, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . the s protein can be divided into two domains by analogy with other coronavirus spike proteins: an n-terminal s1 domain, which contains the receptor-binding site and neutralization epitopes and a cterminal s2 domain which forms the membrane-anchored stalk region and contains a putative fusion peptide followed by two heptad repeats predicted to form a six-helix coiled-coil bundle [41] .in the absence of clinical cases of sars, candidate vaccines will have to be evaluated for efficacy in animal models.the united states fda "animal rule" states that, when efficacy studies in humans are not feasible, vaccines may be approved based on animal data alone, provided the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease is reasonably wellunderstood as is its prevention or reduction by the vaccine. moreover, the protective effect of the vaccine should be demonstrated in more than one animal species expected to react with a response predictive for humans. the endpoint of animal studies should be clearly related to the desired benefit in humans (i.e. enhancement of survival or reduction in major morbidity), and the data generated should allow selection of an effective dose in humans. at the present time it is uncertain whether the "animal rule" would apply to licensure of a sars vaccine. however, it is important to develop standardized animal models and immunological assays in preparation for this eventuality.scientists at the who technical meeting on animal models and antibody assays for evaluating candidate sars vaccines held on 25-26 august 2005 in south mimms, uk, discussed many aspects of research pertaining to the use of animal models in vaccine development including available animal models, suitability of the various models, correlates of protection, critical components of potential vaccines, and the potential for disease enhancement in vaccinated animals following exposure to sars-cov. in addition, standardization of antibody assays and the establishment of a who international standard for sars-cov antibody were also discussed. this report endeavors to summarize the recommendations from this meeting, based on consensus agreement. recommendations for use of each animal model are given in section 2 below. correlates of protection, an overview of vaccine development, and observations pertaining to potential disease enhancement are summarized in the following sections 3-6.in selecting animal models for vaccine evaluation, it is important to remember the principle underlying the so called "animal rule", where data from more than one animal species is often required: each animal species should contribute something different to our understanding of disease and protection. at this time, no single model offers a direct reproduction of what was seen in humans with sars. pathology (including pneumonitis, alveolar edema, and diffuse alveolar damage (dad)) in humans is probably the most difficult element to reproduce in an animal model. attention also should be given to the reduction of viral shedding because this would likely correlate with decreased risk of further spread of the disease among humans. in using animal models to study aspects of sars-cov infection, it must be emphasized that the kinetics of viral replication and appearance and resolu-tion of pathological findings are much more rapid in animal models than in humans.whichever animal model is employed, special consideration should be given to the presence of co-existing pathogens, the age of the animals and the route(s) of infection. a sufficient number of time points and large enough number of animals should be used to allow statistical evaluation. the strain of sars-cov used also could be of importance.it should be emphasized that different species may prove useful for studying different aspects of sars-cov. whereas vaccines or antivirals may be addressed in many models, pathogenesis is best evaluated in those animal models for which immunological tools and reagents are available for detailed analysis of the immune response to the vaccine. this includes inbred mice and rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. it may actually be worthwhile to enhance the virulence of a sars-cov isolate by serial passages in an animal model to produce a challenge virus stock for vaccine studies that would elicit more reproducible disease in the animals. if a highly virulent host-adapted virus were to become available, such as a mouse-adapted or a monkey-adapted sars-cov strain, demonstration of the capacity of vaccines to protect against challenge with these more virulent strains would provide an almost ideal animal model. different models may also need to be employed to evaluate pathogenesis versus immunogenicity. for pathogenesis studies in animal models, mortality is not required as a readout. it would be ideal to develop animal models with comparable levels of mortality to that seen in humans (∼10% overall), including the increased mortality at increased age (∼50% > age 60). the optimal result would be to demonstrate efficacy of vaccines or antivirals in sars-cov animal models that mimic human morbidity and mortality and that show protection without vaccine-associated immunopathology.inbred mouse strains (balb/c, c57bl/6, 129svev, stat1−/−) support sars-cov replication and can develop pneumonitis (129s), but pneumonia and clinical symptoms are only observed in older balb/c mice [24] . the mouse model is suitable for immunogenicity and efficacy studies of vaccines.prolonged viral replication, dissemination of virus to liver and spleen and accompanying pathology are seen in stat1−/− mice; these mice, therefore, also are suitable for studies of pathogenesis and evaluation of antiviral drugs. specific pathogen-free (spf) animals must be used. their age can be either 4-8 weeks or over 12 months and should be specified. the number of animals included must be sufficient for statistical analysis, and should include mock-infected controls.a variety of sars-cov strains has been tested in mice, including urbani, frankfurt, hku-39849, tor-2, and the mouse-adapted sars-cov strain ma-15. these were inoculated by the intranasal (in) route under light anesthesia [21, 42] , using a dose of 10 5 tcid 50 in 50 l/mouse. critical time points for specimen collections are days 2 (peak titer) and 5 post-infection (p.i.) for quantitative virology, days 3 and 5 p.i. for the study of interstitial pneumonitis and dad in aged mice (inflate lungs with 10% neutral-buffered formalin), and day 9 for resolution.golden syrian hamsters are an excellent animal model because they demonstrate high levels of sars-cov replication and develop pneumonitis. hamsters are suitable for vaccine efficacy, immunoprophylaxis and treatment studies [24] . in contrast with balb/c mice, in which the virus is detected only in the respiratory tract and is cleared by day 5 p.i., hamsters demonstrate a longer duration of viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract, some transient viremia, spread of the virus to liver and spleen and, most significantly, inflammation of respiratory tissues [21, 24] . spf animals older than 5 weeks of age should be used in sufficient number for statistical analysis and study design should include mock-infected animals. the animals can be housed in pairs or by three if the experiment is to last less than 4-6 weeks. reserve space should be available to separate the animals in case of fights. males and littermates tend to fight less.virus strains that have been tested in hamsters are urbani, frankfurt and hku-39849. virus should be administered by the in route under light anesthesia, using a dose of 10 3 tcid 50 in 100 l/hamster.as an outcome of efficacy studies, quantitative virology should be preferred over quantitative pcr. for pathology studies, one can grade pathology as none, mild, moderate or severe as per roberts et al. [24] . critical time points for specimen collection are days 2 or 3 p.i. (peak viral titer) and 7 (clearance) for quantitative virology studies; and days 5 p.i. (consolidation and pneumonitis) and 14 or 21 (resolution) for pathology studies (lung).there is evidence from one study that ferrets support sars-cov replication and develop pulmonary lesions [23] but according to another study, the animals remain asymptomatic, in the presence of sars-cov replication [38] . in view of these conflicting data, the ferret model needs to be further studied to determine its optimal utility for vaccine efficacy and immune prophylaxis studies. additional studies are needed to define the extent of biological variability of the model and the possible role of co-pathogens that may contribute to the variability observed between different laboratories.animals aged 6 months or older should be used. although not well documented, more consistent viral replication, pathology and clinical symptoms seem to be observed in older animals. the animals should be screened for viral co-pathogens: aleutian mink disease, respiratory viruses, hepatitis viruses, and others. the route of inoculation may be in or it, but not iv. the dose of virus (strains tor-2, hku-39849) sufficient to ensure reproducibility of infection in all animals is likely to be 10 5 pfu or more/ferret. again, quantitative virology is preferred over qrt-pcr. for pathology studies, the same recommendations apply as for nonhuman primate studies (see below): slides should be shared between pathologists to develop a scoring system. regarding specimen collection of respiratory tissues, further studies are needed to establish how much variation occurs in samples from different lobes of the lungs. critical time points are day 3 p.i. for quantitative virology and days 4-5 p.i. for pathology studies (pneumonitis).nhps support sars-cov replication and develop pneumonitis with a variable degree of clinical symptoms depending upon the species employed. no single nhp species is preferred at this time. the number of animals in a given study needs to be large enough to account for animal-toanimal variability: a sample of 4 or 5 animals is not sufficient. in view of the cost of the experiments, challenge studies should be limited to those vaccine candidates that are most promising, using larger sample sizes (10-12 animals/group) and avoiding animals with free-range periods in life if possible. immunological responses are best studied in species for which microarrays and reagents for identifying immune components are available, such as rhesus or cynomolgus macaques. however, the limited viral replication observed in cynomolgus macaques might be a disadvantage in selecting this species for studies. other recommended nhp species are the common marmoset and african green monkeys (agms, chlorocebus aethiops sabeus). the country of origin may play an important role and should be specified, e.g. philippines (cynomolgus macaques, macaca fascicularis); china (rhesus, macaca mulatta); brazil (marmosets, callithrix jacchus), etc.prior to the experiment, the animals should be housed indoor to limit exposure to potential co-pathogens. they should be screened for parasites (strongyloides, pneumonyssus simicola (lung mites)) and for possible viral co-pathogens (retroviruses, respiratory viruses, adenoviruses). the sars-cov strains tested in nhp models are hku-39849 (cynos), pumc (rhesus) and urbani (marmosets and agms). these were inoculated by the respiratory route (in, it) at a dose of 10 6 pfu or more/nhp.here again, quantitative virology is preferred over qrt-pcr. for pathology studies, it would be an obvious advantage that laboratories share pathology slides for review by different pathologists in order to develop a scoring system. specimens of respiratory tissues should be collected, but further studies are needed to establish how much variation occurs in samples from different lobes of the lungs, as was done and reported for african green monkeys (agms) [28] . critical time points are days 2-4 p.i. for quantitative virology in cynomolgus macaques and agms, and later than day 4 p.i. for rhesus macaques of chinese origin. for collection of tissues for histopathological analyses, days 2-4 p.i. are optimal for cynomolgus macaques and agms, and later than day 4 p.i. for rhesus macaques. due to limitations of immunological reagents (including microarray assays now available), research may be limited to rhesus and cynomolgus macaques.data on other animal models are insufficient for consideration for use in sars-cov vaccine and antiviral evaluations [43] [44] [45] . any additional model other than the four listed above (section 2.2.1 to section 2.2.4) would require thorough characterization including viral replication data and histopathological analysis of sars-cov-infected and mockinfected animals of the same age and gender. viral replication and histopathological data in any new animal model should be reminiscent of at least some aspect of sars in humans.although all the correlates of protection from sars associated disease have not been identified in human infections, neutralizing antibodies are present in convalescent human serum. antibodies to sars-cov spike (s) protein have been shown to prevent virus entry and neutralize virus infectivity in vitro [32, 46] . prophylactically administered monoclonal antibodies and passively transferred sars-cov hyper-immune sera have been shown to prevent sars-cov infection and associated disease following sars-cov challenge of naive mice and hamsters [21, 34, [47] [48] [49] . monoclonal antibodies administered therapeutically (i.e. post-infection) also have been shown to limit viral replication and reduce associated disease in hamsters [50] .although cell mediated immunity may have a protective role in viral clearance or resolution of disease, work in animal models shows that antibody alone is effective for prevention and treatment of sars. thus, mice immunized with live-recombinant vaccines expressing the sars-cov spike protein, using rabies virus [51] , vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) [52] , adenovirus (ad5) [27, 53] or attenuated vaccinia virus mva [36, 38] as a vector, as well as mice immunized with dna vaccines expressing the s gene [37, 54] , developed neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov and were protected against sars-cov challenge. similar findings were reported after mucosal immunization of hamsters and agms using a bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (bpiv3) vector expressing the sars cov s gene [33, 39] . several whole inactivated virus and recombinant protein candidate vaccines also have been developed and shown to elicit a neutralizing antibody response that provided protection against infectious challenge [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . in addition, passively administered sera from vaccinated animals prevented sars-cov infection upon subsequent challenge of naïve mice, demonstrating that antibodies induced by these vaccines did confer protection [37, 52] .the neutralizing antibody titer that is necessary to achieve protection in humans exposed to sars-cov is, however, still not known.it was recommended that when evaluating vaccine efficacy in future animal experiments, the challenge virus should be administered at two different time-points, once when postimmunization neutralizing antibody titers are high, and later when neutralizing antibody titers have waned or are low. it also was suggested that viral titers and pathology should be evaluated at two different time points. specific times points for sample collection are given for each animal model in section 2 above.previous observations of disease enhancement have been reported for human viral pathogens and shown to be due to antibody-mediated enhancement of virus entry (for reviews see [61, 62] ). enhanced disease and mortality have been observed in kittens immunized against or infected with a type-i coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv), when subsequently exposed to fipv infection [63] [64] [65] . aggravated fip is apparently a result of enhanced viral entry into macrophages mediated by sub-neutralizing antibody levels [66] . children vaccinated with inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) vaccines developed serious disease on subsequent exposure to rsv [67] [68] [69] . individuals exposed to one of the four serotypes of dengue virus developed severe disease when subsequently infected with a second, different serotype [70, 71] . enhanced disease following rsv vaccine or dengue infection occur by different mechanisms than fipv. in view of such examples of enhanced disease following infection in a vaccinated host, there has been heightened concern that a similar phenomenon could occur with sars-cov vaccines. it was highly recommended, therefore, that known mechanisms of disease enhancement observed with other viruses and especially with other coronaviruses should be examined in sars-cov infections, especially in vaccinated animals. although none of the studies to date have shown enhanced respiratory disease following sars-cov challenge in previously immunized animals, further studies in this area are warranted in view of some of the available in vitro data.antibodies against human sars-cov isolates were shown to enhance the entry of pseudo-typed viruses expressing the civet sars-like cov-spike protein into a human renal adenocarcinoma cell line (786-o) . enhancement was only demonstrated at the level of entry, but not of replication [72] . this phenomenon was seen with pseudo-typed lentiviruses expressing sars-cov spike protein of civet sequence specificity, but not with pseudo-typed viruses expressing spike proteins of human sars-cov isolates. it also was not observed with human isolates of sars-cov. the role of enhanced viral entry, as observed in these in vitro studies, has not been related to any known component of human disease or infection in vivo. however, given that sars-cov may replicate, albeit poorly, in human pbmcs [73, 74] , in vitro experiments looking for antibody-enhancement of sars-cov replication in human cells (e.g. macrophages and b-cells) should be performed.several groups have studied sars-cov infection in animals in the presence of neutralizing and sub-neutralizing levels of sars-cov anti-sera or anti sars-cov s-protein monoclonal antibodies, but no evidence of enhanced respiratory disease has been observed. however, foci of hepatic necrosis were noted following sars-cov challenge in mva-sars-s immunized ferrets [38] . although these findings are worrisome, several questions were raised regarding the significance of the observation. the mva-sars-s vaccine used in these experiments was poorly immunogenic in the ferrets. the question of whether there could have been any co-pathogen in the animals was raised. it also would be important to know if the observed phenomenon depends on the mva vector or on the animal model. it was strongly urged, therefore, that the experiment be repeated in ferrets. additional experiments, in nonhuman primates and hamsters, looking for evidence of enhanced respiratory and hepatic diseases upon vaccination and challenge were also encouraged.several candidate sars vaccines that are at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development are being developed worldwide. in china alone, three companies have been given regulatory approval for the clinical evaluation of a candidate sars vaccine. it is important, therefore, to be able to compare data from each of the candidate vaccines, which, in turn, requires international standardization of the immunological assays used for the evaluation of these vaccines.the accepted method of international standardization is to employ a who international standard (is), which allows comparison of results from different laboratories [75] . this is essential for establishing international requirements for vaccines, diagnostics or therapeutics. an is is prepared from material bearing a close resemblance to the samples being assayed; the material is distributed in glass ampoules with high precision and reproducibility and then freeze dried. it is important that a sufficient number of ampoules (2000-3000) be prepared so as to provide for about 10 years of use, and that the activity of the contents remain stable over this period. the process of establishing a who is involves an international collaborative study, in which the candidate is is compared with other samples. if the results of the tests are suitable, the candidate is assigned a provisional arbitrary unitage, a report is distributed for approval by study participants and for eventual approval by the who expert committee on biological standardization (ecbs). the preparation, storage and distribution of over 90% of is have been undertaken by the national institute for biological standards and control (nibsc) at south mimms (uk), which is a who laboratory for biological standards.nibsc has developed in the past several who iss for calibration of the antibody response against virus vaccines, including iss for antibodies against dengue, hepatitis a virus (hav), [76] hepatitis b virus (hbv), measles, [77] polio, rabies, [78] rubella, and smallpox. a candidate standard against human papilloma virus-16 (hpv-16) is under evaluation. the corresponding is's were used for a variety of antibody assays including virus neutralisation (vn), haemagglutination-inhibition, single radial diffusion, enzyme-linked immunoassay and radio-immunoassay. antibody iss are most useful in epidemiological studies and in clinical trials. their use allows correlates of immunity and potency requirements of prophylactic and therapeutic products to be expressed in international units (ius). data from several collaborative studies demonstrate that use of an is generally reduces the level of variability between assay results.however, there may be problems in using iss due to the complex array of antibody populations in each serum and the different sensitivity of different assay systems. examples of potential problems can be found in hbv and parvovirus b19 studies [79] , which showed that different assay kits gave different results even when the is was included in the assays. another issue is the degree of antigenic homology between the viral antigen used for the preparation of the is and the virus used in the assays. in a jev collaborative study, a candidate antibody is, which had been prepared from the sera of vaccinees immunized with an inactivated vaccine that was antigenically different from some of the viruses used in vn assays, demonstrated that the response to at least some inactivated vaccine is strain specific and the candidate is was consequently not established by the who ecbs. whether a panel of monoclonal antibodies to sars-cov could be used to prepare an is is an attractive alternative which should be explored.significant progress with standardisation of sars-cov antibody assays had been made in china with the development of a national antibody standard. in order to develop the national standard, sera were collected from 20 convalescent sars patients who were found to have sars-cov vn antibody titers ranging from undetectable to 1:203. one serum sample was selected for further evaluation based on crossreactivity with four sars-cov strains and on western blot analysis. this serum was freeze dried in 0.5 ml aliquots and was then assessed for stability by vn assays. the chinese standard was assigned a vn titer of 52.7 with 95% confidence limits of 47.6-62.2.a further important development in china was the preparation of human immunoglobulin for treatment of sars patients. national guidelines have been prepared for collec-tion of plasma, quality control testing and standardisation of assays. three chinese manufacturers have been licensed for preparation of sars immunoglobulin. the source material was plasma from convalescent patients at more than 28 days after infection. all were in good health and their plasma tested negative for blood-borne agents. plasma samples were processed by a combination of cold ethanol fractionation and ultrafiltration. in september 2003, three lots of igg were produced and assayed by nationally-agreed procedures. the stock of immunoglobulin currently available is sufficient to treat 100 patients. monoclonal antibodies have not yet been considered for treatment purposes in china.the importance of assessing immunogenicity of candidate sars-cov vaccines using vn assays is well acknowledged, but the variety of vn tests in use is a significant problem since there is at this time no consensus on the most sensitive, specific, and reproducible assay system. it is therefore desirable to establish an antibody is to serve as a basis of comparison in all vn assays. the most important activity at this time is to obtain a suitable source of antibody. a number of options can be considered, such as convalescent human sera, post-immunization human sera, monoclonal antibodies or hyperimmune animal sera. as an example, the availability of a suitable source of serum from convalescent patients in hong kong needs to be explored, although antibody levels in these individuals are probably quite low by now.it also would be important that other assays than vn be included in the collaborative study, and that the impact of sars-cov strain variation be examined by using different sars-cov strains and/or sera with different specificities.the centralized facility for aids reagents (cfar), which is based at nibsc, could be a suitable model for a sars-cov repository [80] . the cfar was established in 1989 to support aids vaccine research and it is now eu-funded [81] . there are currently 2000 reagents available including peptides, recombinant proteins, human sera/plasma, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, expression systems, cdna clones and viruses. a comparison can be drawn between sars-cov and hiv vn assays. currently, there are several different hiv neutralization assays formats under consideration and a lack of agreement on the most suitable assay. the cfar is supporting a joint who/eu project (neunet) to evaluate and standardize hiv vn assays in an international collaborative study.in the usa, a sars-cov repository has been established on behalf of the american type culture collection (atcc) in order to meet the needs of biodefence and the threat of emerging infections [82] . the type of reagents stored includes viruses, peptide arrays, monoclonal antibodies and proteins. it is hoped that an active collaboration can be established between niaid and nibsc in order to meet the expanding needs of the sars research community.based on the discussion at the meeting, the following recommendations were made with respect to standardization of the immunological assays for sars vaccine evaluation: 1. a who repository for sars-cov reagents ought to be developed. collaboration between niaid and nibsc is recommended to achieve this goal. 2. consensus must be reached for the reagents to be given priority in the repository.needed. 4. the most suitable source of antibody for the is is convalescent human sera, but post-vaccination human sera could also be used. 5. a protocol for an international collaborative study aimed at validating the is should be developed and distributed to prospective participants. 6. collaborative study participants should be asked about their assay capabilities, e.g. number of sera, virus strains handled, etc. . . 7. the proposed is collaborative study should include a core set of antibody preparations to be distributed and assayed in each laboratory (e.g. monoclonal antibodies, animal sera, other human sera). 8. tests should be conducted using the same strain of sars-cov in each laboratory, but the different genetic lineages of sars-cov should also be represented in the study.biosafety issues associated with sars-cov vaccine development stem from the reports of laboratory-acquired infections in china. sanofi pasteur has adopted bsl 4 practices and bsl 3 equipment (e.g. class 2 or 3 microbiological safety cabinets with respiratory protective equipment) for the preparation of sars-cov vaccines. of note is the fact that sars-cov appears to be quite resistant to normal methods of virus decontamination (jf saluzzo, personal communication). who has developed guidance, both general [83] , and specific for handling sars specimens [84] .the rapid success in the development of immunogenic and protective vaccines against sars using a variety of platforms is encouraging, but should be tempered with concerns about the possibility of enhanced disease following exposure in vaccinated individuals [85] . concerns mainly stem from reports of enhanced disease in fipv-immunized or -infected kittens [63, 66] , from observations that antibodies elicited against certain coronaviruses mediate antibody-dependent enhancement of viral entry [65] , and from the observation of inflammatory foci in liver tissue following sars-cov challenge in mva-sars-s vaccinated ferrets [38] .candidate sars vaccines will need to be evaluated in more than one animal model. they also will need to be thoroughly evaluated for the duration of the antibody response they induce, as well as for the breadth of their protective effi-cacy against different strains of sars-cov. the implications of the sequence heterogeneity among sars-cov strains are difficult to test at this time because the most divergent strains (civet sars-like viruses) have not been recovered in culture.validation and international standardization of immunological assays for the evaluation of candidate sars vaccines are essential to compare data across different trials. this requires the establishment of international standards for sars-cov antibody and a repository for sars-cov reagents, with an international collaborative study to validate the iss. the establishment of the repository by who in collaboration with nibsc and niaid was recommended.nisreen ma okba, v stalin raj and bart l haagmans middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) is a cause of severe respiratory infection in humans, specifically the elderly and people with comorbidities. the re-emergence of lethal coronaviruses calls for international collaboration to produce coronavirus vaccines, which are still lacking to date. ongoing efforts to develop mers-cov vaccines should consider the different target populations (dromedary camels and humans) and the correlates of protection. extending on our current knowledge of mers, vaccination of dromedary camels to induce mucosal immunity could be a promising approach to diminish mers-cov transmission to humans. in addition, it is equally important to develop vaccines for humans that induce broader reactivity against various coronaviruses to be prepared for a potential next cov outbreak.coronaviruses are the largest positive sense single stranded rna viruses. there are six human coronaviruses (hcov) to date; hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-nl63, hcov-hku1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov, and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)-cov. prior to the sars-cov epidemic in 2002-2003, covs were known to cause mild respiratory infections in humans. sars-cov, on the other hand, infected around 8000 cases causing severe respiratory disease with a 10% fatality rate [1] . ten years later, mers-cov emerged in the human population also to cause severe respiratory infection [2] . in contrast to the sars-cov epidemic, which was contained within one year, mers-cov still continues to cause outbreaks with increasing geographical distribution, four years after its first identification. as of march 2nd 2017, 1905 cases in 27 countries have been reported to the who with 677 deaths accounting for a 35% case fatality rate (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). like sars-cov, mers-cov emerged as a result of zoonotic introduction to the human population. despite its close genome similarity with bat coronavirus hku4 and hku5 [2] , accumulating serological and molecular evidence pointed to dromedary camels as the most probable reservoir for mers-cov [3] [4] [5] . this poses a continuous risk of virus spill-over to people in contact with camels, such as those working in slaughter houses and animal farms, evidenced by the presence of mers-cov antibodies in sera of those individuals [6, 7] . nosocomial transmission, however, accounts for the majority of mers-cov cases reported in outbreaks [8] [9] [10] , although a substantial part of infections that occur result in unrecognized asymptomatic or mild illnesses [11] . thus, in addition to camel contacts, other highly-at-risk groups are healthcare workers and patient household contacts [8, 12, 13] . considering the ongoing mers-cov outbreaks, it is crucial to develop intervention measures among which vaccines play an important role. despite the fact that the emergence of mers-cov and sars-cov has dramatically changed the way we view covs, there is no licensed cov vaccine or therapeutic drug available to date [14, 15] .a cornerstone for rational vaccine design is defining the determinants of immune protection. accumulating data from studies done so far on mers-cov and other coronaviruses revealed that a combination of both virusspecific humoral and cellular immune responses is required for full protection against coronaviruses. especially neutralizing antibodies are considered key players in the protective immunity against covs. neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mabs) reduced viral loads in mers-cov receptor-transduced mice, rabbits and macaques [16] [17] [18] [19] . similarly, convalescent camel sera increased virus clearance and decreased lung pathological outcomes in mice with an efficacy directly proportional to anti-mers-cov-neutralizing antibody (nab) titers [20] . also polyclonal sera produced in transchromosomic bovines protected mice against mers-cov challenge [21] .evidence for the protective role of antibodies also comes from recent studies analyzing immune responses in patients that survived or succumbed to mers-cov.although neutralizing antibodies were only weakly inversely correlated to viral loads, serum antibody responses were higher in survivors compared to fatal cases but viral rna was not eliminated from the lungs [22, 23] . administration of convalescent sera, however, did not lead to significant reduction in viral loads [22, 24] . the presence of mucosal iga abs, on the other hand, was found to influence infectious virus isolation [25] .besides humoral immunity, cellular immune responses are also considered to play a crucial role in protection against coronaviruses. while b-cell deficient mice were able to clear mers-cov, those lacking t-cells failed to eliminate the virus, pointing out the crucial role of t-cells in viral clearance [26] . this is supported by the observation that t-cells were able to protect aged mice against sars-cov infection [27 ] and the fact that a reduced tcell count was associated with enhanced disease severity in sars patients [28] . along with other studies, these data highlight the importance of t-cells for virus clearance and protection against mers-cov [26, 27 ] and sars-cov [29, 30] . it is also noteworthy to mention that while neither antibodies nor memory b cells were detectable 6-years post-infection [31] , sars-cov-specific memory t-cells, despite being low in frequency, persisted up to 11 years post-recovery [32] . nonetheless, the protective capacity of such memory response is not known. hence, taking into account the waning of virus-specific humoral responses, generating a long-lived memory t cell response through vaccination could be favorable, but as proper b-and t-cell immune responses are required for efficient protection, vaccination should target the induction of both. at the moment we lack information concerning the longevity of anamnestic immune responses following mers-cov infection, except for a recent study showing that antibody responses, albeit reduced, persisted up to 34 months post-infection [33] . the role of immune responses in protection is also in line with the observed increased fatality among the aged population following mers-cov infection. retrospective studies on mers-cov patients from saudia arabia and south korea have found a significant correlation between old age and mortality [8, 13, [34] [35] [36] , a pattern that has been also reported for other respiratory viruses such as sars-cov [1] and influenza virus [37] . this is most likely caused by immunosenescence; a failure to produce protective immune response to new pathogens in elderly due to impaired antigen presentation, altered function of tlrs, and a reduced naïve b and t cell repertoire [38] . this agerelated increase in mortality was also reported in sars-cov laboratory-infected animals, that is, mice and nonhuman primates (nhps) [39, 40] , and was associated with low neutralizing antibodies and poor t-cell responses [41, 42, 43 ] . several factors that play a role in t-cell activation were also found to be dysregulated in an age-related manner.age-related increase in phospholipase a 2 group iid (pla 2 g2d), and prostaglan-dind 2 in the lungs contributed to a diminished t-cell response and severe lung damage through diminishing respiratory dendritic cell (dc) migration [44, 45] . likewise, adoptive transfer of t-cells to mice enhanced viral clearance and survival [29] , highlighting the contribution of a reduced t-cell response in severe disease outcome. these observations also highlight the need for more effective preventive measures for the elderly. in this sense, induction of a potent airway t-cell response may be crucial to protect against covs [27 ] . thus, a promising approach to protect against mers-covinduced fatality is to enhance virus-specific tissue (airway) resident memory t-cell responses through intranasal vaccination.although the mers-cov genome encodes for 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) and four structural proteins, the spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) [46] , the viral structural proteins, s and n, show the highest immunogenicity [47] . while both s and n proteins can induce t-cell responses, neutralizing antibodies are almost solely directed against the s protein, with the receptor binding domain (rbd) being the major immunodominant region [48] . thus, current mers-cov vaccine candidates mainly employ the spike protein or (parts of) the gene coding for this glycoprotein.these mers-cov vaccines candidates were developed using a wide variety of platforms, including whole virus vaccines, vectored-virus vaccines, dna vaccines, (table 1) and protein-based vaccines ( table 2) . although live attenuated vaccines produce the most robust immune responses, they pose a risk from reversion to virulence. inactivated virus vaccines may cause harm due to incomplete attenuation or the capacity to induce lung immunopathology [49] . viral-vector-based vaccines, on the other hand, provide a safer alternative and have been developed using modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) [50, 51, 52 ] , adenovirus (adv) [53, 54] , measles virus (mev) [55] , rabies virus (rabv) [56] , and venezuelan equine encephalitis replicons (vrp) [26, 57] , all expressing mers-s/s1 proteins. additionally, vrp expressing the n protein have also been developed [27 ] . a major hurdle facing these viral-vector-based platforms is preexisting immunity in the host which potentially can impair the vaccine efficacy. however, this can be prevented by using virus strains not circulating in the targeted population or immunization strategies involving heterologous prime-boost immunization, for example, mva and adv. although plasmid dna vaccines are considered to be of low immunogenicty in humans, current versions developed seem to induce potent immune responses. dna-based vaccines directed at inducing anti s responses were also shown to exert protection in nhps [58, 59] . noteworthy to mention is middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccines: current status and novel approaches okba, raj and haagmans 51 ad/hdpp4-mice, mice transduced with hdpp4 in an adenoviral vector; alum, aluminum hydroxide; e, envelope protein; hdpp4, human

domain of spike protein; s367-606, amino acid residues 367-606 of the s protein; s736-761-klh, peptide s736-761 coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin; s.c., subcutaneous; vlps, virus-like particles; a i.m.;alum/cpg odn produced higher neutralizing antibody responses than s.c.; ifa/cpg odn. b s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc, s367-606-fc, and s377-588-fc were tested and s377-588-fc had the highest nab titers although some produced equal s1 igg response [66] . c mf59 produced the highest immunogenicity at low doses of antigen compared to s377-588-fc only, or with freund's/alum/mpla-sm/isa51/mf59. [67] 1 mg of antigen with mf59 was sufficient to produce humoral and cellular immune responses similar to higher doses (5 mg or 20 mg) [68] . d i.n. + poly(i:c) vaccination induced stronger systemic cellular responses and higher local immune responses in mice lungs (iga and neutralizing antibody titers) than s.c. + montanide isa51 vaccination.that a combination of dna (s) and recombinant protein (s1) in a heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy induced higher immune response (nab) compared to each component alone [58] . additionally, protein-based vaccines were developed in various platforms as virus-like particles (vlps) [60] , nanoparticles [61] , peptide-based [62] , and subunit vaccines directed against various regions of the spike protein s1 [58] , the n-terminal domain [63] , and the rbd [48, [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] . those vaccines have the highest safety profile among vaccine platforms but confer variable degrees of immunogenicity which need adjustment for the dose, adjuvants, and site of administration to get optimal protective responses. adjuvants influence the type and magnitude of immune response produced by vaccines, and thus the doses used [61, 65, 68] . additionally, the route of administration is a determining factor for the type of vaccine-induced immune response produced in the host. while intranasal (i.n.) vaccination with sars-n produced a protective airway t-cell response against sars-cov in mice, subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination, inducing systemic t-cell responses, did not [27 ] . likewise, i.n. vaccination with mers-rbd induced a significantly higher neutralizing and iga antibody responses in the mice airways compared to s.c. vaccination [70] . this is important because mucosal immunity and airway memory t-cell responses are crucial players in protection against respiratory viruses, since these areas are the first to encounter the virus. therefore, along with selecting antigens for a vaccine, the route of vaccination and adjuvants are key players that cannot be neglected in vaccine design.because the spike protein and more specifically the s1 domain, is highly divergent among different covs, neutralizing antibodies only provide homotypic protection. thus far, the variability in the amino acid sequence of the spike protein observed among mers-cov strains is low [71] , and circulating mers-cov strains did not show any significant variation in the serological reactivity [25, 59] , implying that the development of a vaccine that is effective against one strain is likely to be protective against all circulating strains. another risk posed from the development of antibody escape variants is still present [72, 73] , although this is not likely to happen as mutations in two epitopes may be required, and mutants that develop may have reduced viral fitness [73, 74] .while the rbd is considered an ideal vaccine candidate for mers-cov, the spike s2 domain and n protein are more conserved, and thus adaptive immune response directed against these proteins can potentially lay the basis for a more broadly acting coronavirus vaccine. however, evidence for cross reactive immune responses against different covs is limited to a few studies. convalescent sars-cov patient sera weakly neutralized mers-cov [75] and sars-s reactive antisera showed low level neutralization of mers-cov [61] . extra-rbd s1 or s2 epitopes could be responsible for this effect, as some neutralizing epitopes have been identified in these regions of the s protein [58, 62] . these may not be as immunodominant as the rbd epitopes but could provide a rationale for the development of a cross protective cov epitope-focused vaccine. a recent study also demonstrated the potential role of adaptive response against n protein in protection against mers-cov infection as this vaccine candidate produced a protective t-cell response against mers-cov challenge which was also partially protective against sars-cov [27 ] . moreover, infection of mice with sars-cov reduced mers-cov titers 5 days p.i. upon challenge suggesting the development of a cross reactive t-cell response [26] . thus, mapping and focusing the immune response towards these critical neutralizing and t-cell epitopes, which could be subdominant, may provide a way to induce immune responses with a broader activity against different covs. immune focusing may also be beneficial for the generation of a robust virus-specific immune response. as during vaccine preparation, some epitopes which are normally hidden in the full length protein structure get exposed. some epitopes could be immunodominant and have a negative contribution on the overall neutralization capacity produced by the vaccine [76 ] . this also holds true for some non-neutralizing immunodominant epitopes, as s1-based vaccines induced slightly higher neutralization than whole s ectodomain-based ones [58, 53] . additionally, the rbd induced higher neutralizing antibodies compared to an s1 subunit vaccine [48] , and shorter regions of rbd induced even higher neutralization responses [66] , indicating that additional regions inducing non-neutralizing antibodies may contribute negatively to the overall neutralization response produced. additionally, antibody-dependent enhancement of the viral infection by non-neutralizing antibodies [77] [78] [79] , despite not being reported so far for mers-cov, needs also to be taken into consideration when developing a coronavirus vaccine. one approach to enhance the efficacy of subunit vaccines is to mask those negativelycontributing epitopes through glycosylation [76 ] . other approaches are immunefocusing and epitope-based vaccines, all aiming at narrowing the immune response to target only critical or beneficial epitopes to produce a stronger protective response. a prerequisite to reach that goal is to map epitopes targeted by the immune system and identify their biological role as being neutralizing, non-neutralizing, infection enhancing, containing a tcell epitope, and so on. this can be achieved by analyzing the activity and fine specificity of convalescent patient sera, infected animal polyclonal sera, monoclonal antibodies, animal and human pbmcs. subsequently the predicted epitopes can also provide a basis for potential vaccine candidates when produced as nanoparticles or vlps. further characterization of the immune responses induced by these vaccine candidates when evaluated in an animal model may be utilized to optimize the vaccines for efficacy (figure 1 ). this epitope-focused vaccine approach may allow for targeting less immunodominant b-and t-cell epitopes having broader protection, avoid eliciting immune responses against epitopes playing no role in protection or having a negative or harmful role. in addition to better targeting of protective immunodominant epitopes, a combination of those epitopes, b-and tcell epitopes targeting different viral proteins, could be used to produce a broader and stronger protective immune response for both strain-specific and universal cov vaccines.next to the choice of the mers-cov vaccine candidate, it is also important to take into account the target population that needs to be protected through vaccination. populations at risk of mers-cov infection include camel contacts, healthcare workers and patient contacts. the latter two groups could benefit from the rapid onset of immunity though passive immunization using mabs or convalescent sera, provided that it is given in time.another alternative strategy for short-term protection is the use of vaccines capable of rapidly inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies. this will provide a short-term immunity beneficial to protect those highly-at-risk groups when a new case is identified, to prevent outbreaks. to prevent virus infection of primary cases, vaccination of the dromedary camels may also be considered. so far, among the available vaccine candidates, only two have been tested in dromedary camels, pvax1-s and mva-s. pvax1-s, a dna-based vaccine, induced neutralizing antibodies in two of three camels tested so far, but has not been tested for efficacy [59] . the other candidate mva-s, a viral-vector-based vaccine, induced systemic neutralizing antibodies and mucosal immunity which conferred protection against mers-cov challenge and reduced virus shedding in vaccinated camels [52 ] therefore, this vaccine candidate may provide a means to prevent zoonotic transmission of the virus to the human population. for camel contacts and healthcare workers in endemic areas, being at a continuous risk of mers-cov infection either from infected camels or patients, respectively, it would be beneficial to induce a longer-term (mucosal) protection. while these could be rewarding approaches to stop mers-cov outbreaks, it is still worthwhile to develop platforms and vaccines that aim to induce more broad protection against different related covs, that could potentially cause future outbreaks.learning from previous epidemics, the who issued a list of priority pathogens posing a risk to the human population and requiring urgent research and development (r&d) for intervention measures, among which mers-cov and highly pathogenic covs are of high priority. the lack of intervention measures along with the increase in geographical area and ongoing mers- epitope-based vaccine design. following a virus infection, potential protective b-and t-cell epitopes are mapped. peptides or proteins containing promising epitopes are produced and formulated using a suitable platform, for example, nanoparticles and tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in animals. follwing several cycles of testing and optimization, a final vaccine suitable for human use may be produced.cov cases, raise worries for the future occurrence of larger epidemics as a result of virus adaptation in the human population and more efficient human-to human transmission. further development of mers-cov and other cov vaccines thus needs proactive collaborative efforts from researchers filling knowledge gaps, and market stakeholders providing funding for this costly process. the latter can be insufficient and/or unsustainable, therefore hindering development of even some promising candidates. in an initiative aiming at accelerating vaccine r&d process by providing sustained funding to be prepared for future epidemics, the world economic forum launched the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) [80] . cepi is an international non-profit association aiming at removing barriers facing vaccine development for epidemic infections and getting ready for future epidemics, including mers-cov. however, we still face a number of challenges despite the fact that various promising mers-cov vaccine candidates are currently available. there is a lack of animal models mimicking the disease in humans in which vaccine platforms can be tested prior to human use. we need to take into account the populations to target with vaccination, with camels and camel handlers being the most relevant ones. the lack of full understanding of the pathogenesis and immune responses to the virus in humans and camels, which is crucial for vaccine development, also needs further investments. in addition, the longevity of immune responses post-vaccination has not been evaluated for vaccine candidates, which is important for the vaccination scheme development and for the choice of the best candidates for further development. lastly, most of the vaccine candidates are developed against the highly variable spike protein and thus may not be able to provide protection against cov strains evolving in the future. a more targeted vaccination approach aiming at conserved epitopes should be considered for the development of a more broadly-acting cov vaccine. given the propensity of covs to jump the species barrier, current efforts to develop a mers-cov vaccine may also be of benefit to prepare for potential novel covs that may emerge in the future.. (a) the designed multi-epitope vaccine has the capacity to trigger both humoral and cell mediated immunity. the vaccine is processed in the antigen presenting cells (apcs) and the antigenic epitopes are recognized by mhc i receptors which further stimulates cytotoxic t cell (t c cell) development. t c cells trigger cytokine production which causes cytotoxic t cells to divide and attack the infected cells. the activated t cells also differentiate into memory t cells. similarly, vaccine antigen is processed and presented in context of mhc class ii molecule. b cells differentiate into plasma cells and memory b cells upon activation by cytokines. further, the activated b cell or plasma cell produces the neutralizing antibodies responsible for clearing an infection. (b) tlr signal transduction pathway: tlr 2 homodimer utilizes myd88 and mal as primary adapters to activate nf-κb that triggers inflammatory cytokine secretion. tlr4 uses four primary adapters namely myd88, mal, trif and tram for nf-κb secretion which in turn induce inflammatory cytokine secretion activating ifn pathway.the conventional method of vaccine designing, involving entire organisms or large proteins lead to unnecessary antigenic load along with increased chances of allergenic responses 28 . this problem can be overcome by peptide based vaccines comprising short immunogenic peptide fragments with the ability to elicit strong and targeted immune responses, avoiding the chances of allergenic reactions 28 . recent advancements in computational biology have opened up new doors for designing effective vaccines in silico [29] [30] [31] . in this study, the in silico approach has been applied for attaining a multi-epitope vaccine against sars-cov-2 that comprises of spike glycoprotein epitopes which induces the activation of cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls), helper t lymphocytes (htls) and interferon-γ (ifn-γ) (fig. 2) .sequence retrieval and phylogenetic analysis. the spike glycoprotein sequence of sars-cov-2 was retrieved from pdb (6vsb). phylogenetic analysis of the sars-cov-2 glycoprotein was performed in order to check the evolutionary relationship of sars-cov-2 with other coronaviruses (hcov-nl63, hcov-229e, hcov-0c43, hku-1, mers-cov, sars-cov) (fig. 3) . the analysis revealed that the glycoprotein variants of sars-cov-2 clustered together in a single clade, having the most common ancestry with sars-cov and mers-cov (fig. 3) . the variants of sars-cov-2 that clustered together had very less branching, indicating minimum variations. hence, the vaccine designed against one strain can be used for all the other strains of sars-cov-2. similarly, the phylogenetic analysis of different sars-cov-2 strains isolated from different countries was conducted to determine if a single vaccine can be used against all the different strains of the virus isolated from various parts of the world (supplementary fig. s1 ). the results indicated that all the glycoproteins of different strains of sars-cov-2, isolated from different countries were closely related to one another, suggesting www.nature.com/scientificreports/ that a vaccine designed against one strain would be effective against all the other strains of viruses isolated from different countries ( supplementary fig. s1 ).t cell epitope prediction. an ideal prophylactic vaccine should mimic the natural immunity induced by an infection with the generation of a long-lasting adaptive immunity, where both ctl and htl epitopes play an important role 32 . the ctl epitopes are responsible for developing long lasting cellular immunity which has the ability to eliminate the circulating virus and the virus infected cells 33 . on the other hand, htl epitopes play a crucial role in generating both humoral and cellular immune responses. these epitopes elicit a cd4 + helper response, which is not only necessary for the development of protective cd8 + t-cell memory but also activation of b-cells for antibody generation 34, 35 . therefore, an effective vaccine candidate should consist of the important ctl and htl receptor specific epitopes. in this study, ctl epitopes were predicted using netctl1.2 and iedb consensus methods whereas, htl epitopes were predicted using netmhc ii pan 3.2 server as shown in tables 1  and 2 (supplementary table s1 , s2). in order to identify the best epitopes, the predicted epitopes were subjected to various immune filters and those having high binding affinity to mhc class i and class ii alleles were selected. the criteria for screening out the epitopes were: they should be promiscuous, should be antigenic and should be immunogenic. the antigenicity of the epitopes was predicted using vaxijen v2.0 and immunogenicity was predicted using iedb class i immunogenicity server. the 3d structure of spike glycoprotein was modelled using i-tasser and the epitopes considered for vaccine construction were visualized on the same (fig. 4 ).multi-epitope vaccine construct, structural modeling, refinement and validation. the main criteria used for designing the linear vaccine construct were: 1. it should contain overlapping htl and ctl epitopes (supplementary table s3 ), 2. it must be immunogenic, antigenic, but not an allergen, 3. it should have high affinity to hla alleles and should be promiscuous. on basis of these parameters, a linear vaccine was constructed including 7 ctl, 8 htl and 3 ifn-γ (tables 1, 2, supplementary table s4 ) epitopes joined by gpgpg linkers which prevent the formation of junctional epitopes and also facilitate the immune processing of antigen 68 . cholera toxin b (ctb) adjuvant was attached to the n-terminal of the construct via eaaak linker (fig. 5a ) in order to boost a long lasting immune response. the final vaccine construct consisted of 422 amino acids with a molecular weight of 44.15 kda. the 3d models of the vaccine were generated using trrosetta server. in order to validate the structural quality of the predicted model, ramachandran plot, z-score and errat analyses were performed. amongst the predicted models, the best model was chosen (fig. 5b ) that had a z-score of − 8.1, which was within the range of scores of comparable size proteins, indicating the reliability of the predicted model 36 (fig. 5d ). the modelled structure was evaluated using rampage and was used for the generation of ramachandran plot. the ramachandran plot analysis of the 3d-model of the vaccine showed that 96.4% residues lied in favoured region, 2.9% residues in allowed and 0.7% residues in outlier regions, respectively which verifies the overall quality of the vaccine construct (fig. 5e ). ideally for a model to be reliable, at least 90% of its residues should lie in the favoured region 37 . the total number of residues present in the favoured region for our 3d model was within the range of the ideal value (more than 90%), which confirms its reliability. the errat score revealed after errat analysis was 74.2947, representing the percentage of the protein falling below the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ rejection limit of 95% 38 (fig. 5c ). generally, an errat score greater than 50 represents a good quality model 39 and so, the score 74.2947 further validates our modelled structure.immunogenic, allergenic and physicochemical evaluation of the vaccine construct. immunogenicity is the ability to induce humoral and cellular immune responses while antigenicity is the ability to recognize a specific antigen accompanied by an immune response. therefore, the vaccine candidate should be antigenic as well as immunogenic in nature 40 . the multi-epitope vaccine construct was found to be immunogenic as predicted by iedb class i immunogenicity tool with a score of 6.65414 and as per the instruction of iedb, higher score indicates a greater probability of eliciting an immune response. vaxijen v2.0 confirmed the antigenicity of the vaccine with a score of 0.5107 (a score > 0.4 is considered to be antigenic). allergenicity was checked in order to ensure that the candidate vaccine does not stimulate any allergic reactions once introduced into the body. the vaccine candidate was found to be non-allergen as predicted by allertop and allergenfp www.nature.com/scientificreports/ web servers. evaluation of various physicochemical properties is essential for determining the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine 41 . hence, various chemical and physical parameters associated with the vaccine were predicted in this study using expasy (supplementary material 1). the theoretical pi of the vaccine was found to be 9.96. the aliphatic index of the vaccine is 78.74 which suggest the vaccine to be of thermostable nature, higher the aliphatic index of a protein, greater is its thermostability 89 . the estimated half-life of the vaccine as predicted by expasy is 30 h in mammalian reticulocytes, > 20 h in yeast and > 10 h in escherichia coli. the grand average hydropathicity (gravy) score is − 0.088 (lower the gravy score, better is the solubility), which indicates the candidate vaccine is of hydrophilic nature, meaning, it can perform interaction with aqueous environment. the instability index of vaccine candidate was found to be 31.04, indicating stable nature of the protein. generally a protein whose instability index is < 40 is classified as a stable protein 89 . since the designed vaccine does not contain any transmembrane helices, no expression difficulties are to be anticipated in the production of vaccine ( supplementary fig. s3 ). also, the absence of signal peptides in the vaccine construct signifies prevention of protein localization ( supplementary fig. s2 ).b cell epitope prediction. b cell epitopes have the ability to elicit humoral immunity as they are recognized by the b-cell receptors or secreted antibodies 42 . the presence of these epitopes in the designed vaccine play an important role in triggering efficient immune response. therefore, in this study, the linear/continuous and conformational/discontinuous b cell epitopes were predicted by the ellipro server using default parameters (tables 3, 4 ). the visualisation of b cell epitopes in the final vaccine construct was done using pymol (the pymol molecular graphics system, version 2.0 schrödinger, llc.) ( supplementary fig. s4 ).population coverage. the distribution and expression of hla alleles may vary across the world based on the difference between regions and ethnicities 43 . in addition, successful vaccine development demands the assessment of hla allele distribution around the world population 44 . therefore, this study was conducted in order to evaluate if the vaccine designed against sars-cov-2 will be effective for the world population. the selected epitopes in our study showed total world population coverage of 95.78% (table 5 ). in addition, the epitopes showed 97 fig. s5 ). the results suggest that the designed multiepitope vaccine can be used to tackle sars-cov-2 globally. table 3 . conformational/ discontinuous b cell epitopes in the multi-epitope vaccine, predicted by ellipro server. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ molecular docking analysis. docking of the vaccine with tlrs. in order to generate a stable immune response, it is important for the vaccine to interact with target immune cell receptors. for studying such interactions, molecular docking studies were performed with toll-like receptors. toll-like receptors (tlrs) have a central role in innate immunity as they detect conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) on a range of microbes, including viruses, leading to innate immune activation and orchestration of the adaptive immune response 45 . tlr4 and tlr2 have also been implicated in the recognition of viral structural proteins leading to inflammatory cytokine production 46 . in addition, several studies on sars-cov have shown the importance of tlr4 and tlr2 in generation of an effective immune response [47] [48] [49] . therefore, molecular docking studies of the vaccine candidate with tlr4/tlr2 were conducted.docking of the vaccine with tlr4. haddock clustered 33 structures in 7 cluster(s), which represents 16.5% of the water refined haddock generated models. the top cluster with the lowest haddock score is the most reliable cluster of all. a representative model of the top cluster was subjected to further refinement using had-dock refinement server, where 20 structures were clustered into one cluster, resulting in 100% of the water refined models generated by haddock. the statistics of the refined model are presented in the table 6 , and the structural analysis of the refined model is shown in supplementary fig. s7 . the haddock score of − 130.9 ± 10.1 suggest a good binding affinity between the vaccine and the receptor, negative score indicates better docking. a buried surface area (bsa) of 2,204.4 ± 22.4 å 2 indicates close proximity and a less water-exposed protein surface 50 . in addition, rmsd scores are also considered as an important parameter for evaluation of efficient docking studies, as it allows us to identify the complex with the lowest energy and least structural deviation. the low rmsd score of the docked complex (table 6) indicates a good quality model. the predicted interaction of the amino acids and a detailed overview of the molecular docking are given in supplementary material 2 and supplementary fig. s8 , respectively. also, ramachandran plot analysis was carried out for structural validation of the docked complex ( supplementary fig. s6 ). the docked complex along with some prominent hydrogen bonds is shown in fig. 6 .docking of vaccine with tlr2. haddock clustered 80 structures in 11 cluster (s), which represents 40.0% of the water refined haddock generated models. the structure with the lowest haddock score was chosen as the top cluster. a representative model of the top cluster was subjected to further refinement using had-dock refinement server, where 20 structures were clustered into one cluster, resulting in 100% of the water refined models generated by haddock. the statistics of the refined model are presented in the table 7 , and the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports/ structural analysis of the refined model is shown in supplementary fig. s10 . there was a good binding affinity between the vaccine and the receptor which is evident from the negative haddock score of − 112.0 ± 2.8 50 . the other docking scores as shown in table 7 suggest a stable binding between the vaccine and the tlr2 receptor. the predicted interaction of the amino acids and a detailed overview of the molecular docking are given in supplementary material 3 and supplementary fig. s11 , respectively. also, ramachandran plot analysis was carried out for structural validation of the docked complex ( supplementary fig. s9 ). the docked complex along with some prominent hydrogen bonds is shown in fig. 7 .docking of vaccine with mhc class i and class ii receptors. the multi-epitope vaccine construct consisting of ctl and htl epitopes interact with mhc class i and mhc class ii receptors, forming epitope-mhc complex which activate the ctls and htls required for immune response generation 51 . in order to study these interactions the molecular docking analysis of the vaccine with mhc class i and class ii receptors was performed.docking of vaccine with mhc class i receptor. haddock clustered 120 structures in 12 cluster(s), which represents 60.0% of the water refined haddock generated models. the structure with the lowest haddock score was chosen as the top cluster. a representative model of the top cluster was subjected to further refinement using haddock refinement server, where 20 structures were clustered into one cluster, resulting in 100% of the water refined models generated by haddock. the statistics of the refined model are presented in the table 8 , and the structural analysis of the refined model is shown in supplementary fig. s13 . the statistics of the refined docked complex indicates a strong binding affinity between the vaccine and mhc class i receptor. the low haddock score of − 214.7 ± 4.1 indicates the docking to be effective and, the lower value of rmsd (table 8) suggest stability of the docked complex. the predicted interaction of the amino acids and a detailed overview of the molecular docking are given in supplementary material 4 and supplementary fig. s14 , respectively. also, ramachandran plot analysis was carried out for structural validation of the docked complex ( supplementary fig. s12 ). the docked complex along with some prominent hydrogen bonds is shown in fig. 8 .docking of vaccine with mhc class ii receptor. haddock clustered 64 structures in 9 cluster (s), which represents 32% of the water refined haddock generated models. the structure with the lowest haddock score was chosen as the top cluster. a representative model of the top cluster was subjected to further refinement www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports/ using haddock refinement server, where 20 structures were clustered into one cluster, resulting 100% of the water refined haddock generated models. the statistics of the refined model as presented in table 9 suggest a good docking score (because of low haddock score), thereby confirming a stable and efficient docking of the vaccine and the mhc class ii receptor. in addition, the structural analysis of the refined model is shown in supplementary fig. s16 . the predicted interaction of the amino acids and a detailed overview of the molecular docking are given in supplementary material 5 and supplementary fig. s17 , respectively. also, ramachandran plot analysis was carried out for structural validation of the docked complex ( supplementary fig. s15 ). the docked complex along with some prominent hydrogen bonds is shown in fig. 9 .binding affinity analysis. the binding affinity of a complex, or the gibbs free energy (∆g) in terms of thermodynamics, is a crucial quantity for determining whether an interaction will actually occur or not in the cell at specific conditions 52 . therefore, the binding affinity of the 4 docked complexes was analysed using prodigy web server. the δg values for the vaccine-tlr4, vaccine-tlr2, vaccine-mhc class i and vaccine-mhc class ii receptor was found to be − 10.3 kcal mol −1 , − 11.2 kcal mol −1 , − 13.5 kcal mol −1 , − 16.0 kcal mol −1 , respectively (table 10 ). the results revealed that all of the 4 dockings were energetically feasible, as indicated by the negative values of gibbs free energy (δg). the dissociation constant (k d ) of the docked complexes are shown in table 10 .energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulation of the vaccine construct. molecular dynamics simulation (mds) is essential to determine the stability of a protein at different thermobaric conditions. in order to check the protein stability, energy minimization for the vaccine was conducted using the steepest descent algorithm of gromacs. once, the force reaches < 1000 kj/mol, the protein is considered to be energy minimised. the energy minimisation for the vaccine construct was conducted for 2,262 steps where the force reached < 1000 kj/mol. the potential energy of the system was computed to be − 3.0e + 06 kj/mol with a total drift of − 3.8 × 10 5 kj/mol and the average potential energy was − 2.9e + 06 kj/mol. after 50,000 steps of nvt the average temperature was 299.8 k with a drift of 1.0 k (fig. 10d) . the average density of the system computed was 1,012.5 kg/m 3 with a total drift of 1.3 kg/m 3 (fig. 10b ). the pressure of the system was found to be 1.6 bar with a total drift of 4.2 bar (fig. 10c ). trajectory analysis was performed after a simulation period of 10 ns in order to check the stability and flexibility of the vaccine candidate. the plot for the radius of gyration showed the compactness of the protein around its axes (fig. 10a) . a plot of rmsd backbone revealed very mild fluctuations, indicating the stability of the vaccine over time (fig. 10e) . the high peaks in the rmsf plot suggested a high degree of flexibility in the vaccine construct (fig. 10f ).was performed so that the vaccine candidate could be expressed into the e. coli expression system. therefore, it was necessary to optimize the codon respective to the vaccine construct as per the usage of e. coli expression system, in order to ensure efficient translation and increased protein production. for optimizing the codon usage of the designed vaccine construct for maximal protein expression in e. coli k-12 strain, jcat tool was used. the generated cdna sequence after codon optimization was 1,266 nucleotides long (supplementary material sm6). generally, a codon adaptation index (cai) value > 0.8 and the gc content between 30 and 70% are considered for a good protein expression in the host system. our vaccine had a codon adaptation index (cai) of 1.0 and gc content of the reverse translated vaccine was 58.53%. these results support a proficient expression of the designed vaccine in e. coli k-12 strain. finally, the recombinant plasmid was designed by inserting the adapted codon sequences into pet-28a (+) vector using snapgene software, computationally (fig. 11 ). this study was conducted in order to design an effective cloning strategy for the candidate vaccine.immune simulation. an in silico immune response was generated using the c-immsim immune server in order to assess the immunogenic profile of multi-epitope vaccine 53 (fig. 12) . the secondary and tertiary responses generated by the simulation were significantly higher when compared to the primary response. the secondary and tertiary responses revealed a decrease in the antigenic concentration with normal high levels of www.nature.com/scientificreports/ immunoglobulin activity (i.e., igg1 + igg2, igm, and igg + igm antibodies). in addition, multiple long lasting b cell isotypes were found, suggesting possible isotype switching potentials and memory formation (fig. 12aii,  supplementary fig. s18 ). the th (helper) and tc (cytotoxic) cell populations also showed a similar higher response with the pre activation of tcs during vaccination (fig. 12aiv, aiii) (supplementary fig. s18 ). the nk (natural killer) and dendritic cell activity was found to be consistent along with higher macrophage activity (supplementary fig. s18 ) demonstrated during the exposure (fig. 12av) . the generation of a good immune response was supported by the high levels of ifn-γ and il-2 elicited in the simulation. after the vaccination, an injection www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of a "live-replicating virus" was simulated at around day 366 in order to check the efficacy of the vaccine. the antigen graph (fig. 12ai) shows that after the vaccination, when a live replicating virus is injected, the antigenic surge is virtually absent, indicating an effective immune response mainly due to the protective action of high concentration of specific antibodies. this outcome should be compared with a control simulation that was also performed consisting of an injection of the live virus after 1 year, without prior vaccination. in this case, results indicate that without prior vaccination the host is unable to contain the antigen, though an inefficacious immune response is generated (fig. 12b, supplementary fig. s19 ). in another control experiment a vaccine construct was designed utilizing randomly generated sequences to see its effect on immune response. as expected, the immune simulation results obtained from the randomly generated sequence shows the absence of any immune response thereby confirming the failure of vaccination (data not shown). the simple reason for this is the lack of antigenic peptides in the random sequence, which in the simulation translates in the absence of antigenic presentation by professional antigen presenting cells.sars-cov-2 has been declared as a global pandemic by world health organization affecting people of all age groups. world health organization's announcement on covid-19 as a global public health emergency has encouraged researchers to develop therapeutics such as drug candidates and vaccines against the disease 54 . the cost effective and time saving immunoinformatic approaches have already helped the researchers to predict www.nature.com/scientificreports/ potential antigenic epitopes required for the development of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate [55] [56] [57] [58] . the distinctive concept of multi-epitope vaccine design as compared to classical single-epitope based vaccine is that, the screening of viral genome to identify immunogenic epitopes results in the elicitation of a highly targeted immune response without any reversal of viral pathogenesis 59 .in this study, we aim at designing a multi-epitope, prophylactic vaccine targeting the spike protein of sars-cov-2, which is one of the major determinants of antigenicity and viral entry into the host cell 3 . several computational tools were used to construct a multi-epitope vaccine, which has the ability to generate both humoral and cell mediated immunity. the multi-epitope vaccine elicits immune responses based on short immunogenic sequences instead of large proteins or whole genome which is typically used for recombinant vaccine technology. thus, this approach avoids the excess antigenic load as well as allergenic responses in the host 28, 60, 61 . the analysis of the entire spectrum of possible antigens can be carried out using immunoinformatics and molecular modelling in order to examine the potential binding with host proteins 55, [62] [63] [64] [65] . in addition, these multi-epitope vaccines have advantages over traditional and single-epitope vaccines due to the following unique features: (i) multiple mhc class i and class ii epitopes can be recognized by tcrs from various t cell subsets, (ii) overlapping ctl, htl and b cell epitopes have the capacity to activate humoral and cellular immune responses simultaneously, (iii) linking an adjuvant to the vaccine ensures a long lasting immune response with enhanced immunogenicity, (iv) the in vitro antigen expression complications as well as the difficulty of culturing the pathogens can also be avoided [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . designing of multi-epitope vaccines is an emerging area which has already gained importance, and the vaccines designed by this approach, have not only shown in vivo efficacy with protective immunity 75-77 but also entered phase-i clinical trials 70, \71,78,79 the present study utilized the potential immunogenic epitopes identified from the sars-cov-2 spike protein to construct the multi-epitope vaccine with cholera toxin b (ctb) as an adjuvant along with appropriate linkers. cholera toxin b, which has been proven to act as a potential viral adjuvant, is linked at the n-terminal of the vaccine construct [80] [81] [82] . glycine rich linker, such as gpgpg, was preferred to link the screened epitopes as it enhances the solubility and enable the adjoining domains to be accessible and act freely 83 . various immunological filters were used to screen the predicted ctl and htl epitopes: the epitopes must be antigenic and immunogenic, should bind with multiple mhc class i and mhc class ii alleles (promiscuous), and must have overlapping ctl and htl epitopes. a similar approach was used by bazhan and his co-workers, where they have designed a t-cell multi epitope vaccine against ebola virus. the t-cell epitopes were predicted using iedb-immune epitope database and the vaccine candidate constructed using the suitable epitopes were found to be immunogenic when expressed in mice 84 . our designed vaccine was predicted to be non-allergen using allertop v.2.0 server which was further verified by allergenfp v.1.0 [85] [86] [87] [88] . the other physicochemical properties of the vaccine were analysed using protparam tool offered by expasy server 89 . the molecular weight of the construct was 44.15 kda and the instability index was evaluated to be 31.04 which classify the vaccine to be stable. generally, figure 11 . in silico restriction cloning. the red coloured portion represents the codon optimised multi-epitope vaccine inserted into the pet-28a (+) expression vector which is represented in black colour. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ a protein whose instability index is lesser than 40 is predicted to be stable and values above that predicts the protein as unstable 89 . the theoretical pi of the vaccine was calculated to be 9.96. the gravy index of the vaccine was − 0.088, (lower the gravy score, better is the solubility), which is reflective of the vaccine's polar nature and its effective interaction with water, suggesting high solubility 90 . the aliphatic index of 78.74 indicated the protein to be thermostable 91 . the half-life of the vaccine was evaluated to be 30 h (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro), > 20 h (yeast, in vivo) and > 10 h (escherichia coli, in vivo) which indicates the time taken by the protein to reach 50% of its concentration after its synthesis in the cell. similarly, foroutan and his colleagues have also used the same array of in silico analysis in order to assess the allergenecity and physicochemical properties of their designed vaccine candidate against toxoplasma gondii 92 . they have also performed laboratory validation of their vaccine candidate, which revealed that the multi-epitope vaccine was able to trigger strong humoral and cellular responses in mice 92 . the physicochemical properties predicted in our study were comparable to those predicted by foroutan et al., in their recently published work 92 . in fact, the instability index and aliphatic index of our vaccine candidate was found to be better when compared to the values reported by foroutan et al. 92 . the structural validation of our vaccine construct performed by ramachandran plot analysis using rampage showed that 96.4% of residues were in favoured region, 2.9% were in the allowed region and only 0.4% of the residues were placed in the outlier region thereby, validating the tertiary structure of the vaccine. the errat score of 74.29 further validated the overall quality of our vaccine and z-score assessment by prosa web server revealed a score of − 8.1, indicating that the protein falls in the plot which consists of the z-scores of the already determined structures solved by nmr and x-ray crystallographic experiments 36 .the spike glycoprotein of sars-cov-2, which is one of the structural components of the virus, should be recognized by the toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) expressed in the plasma membrane www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of the cells 45, 93, 94 . human toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) is expressed in various types of immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes and immature dendritic cells 95 . a direct interaction between tlr4 and ctb is responsible for the activation of tlr4 by ctb 96 . this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the capacity of ctb to induce inflammatory response is lost in tlr4-deficient macrophages 96 . the elisa-based assays have demonstrated that ctb is able to induce nf-κb activation in tlr4 receptor cells by binding to it directly 96 . in addition, tlr2 is also associated with recognition of viral envelop glycoprotein 93 . the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (myd88) acts as the primary adaptor for the core tlr2 signalling pathway, which results in nf-κb and mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) activation, leading to secretion of a core panel of cytokines 93 . the interaction pattern of the vaccine with tlr4 and tlr2 was analysed by molecular docking studies (figs. 6,  7) . the docking analysis of tlr4 and the vaccine construct showed that there are 3 salt bridges and 7 hydrogen bonds formed during this interaction. the docked complex shows that the salt bridges were formed between arg41, glu68, asp69 of tlr4 and asp113, lys85, lys82 of vaccine, respectively. similarly, docking analysis of tlr2 and the vaccine construct also showed that there are 3 salt bridges and 9 hydrogen bonds formed during the interaction. the salt bridges formed in this case were between asp516, asp520, arg547 of tlr4 and lys85, lys82, glu105 of our vaccine, respectively. several studies on sars-cov have shown the importance of tlr4 and tlr2 in generation of an effective immune response. 49 . the sensitized tlr2 triggers the release of il-8 which is an important chemokine, necessary for generating an innate immune response 49 .the molecular dynamics simulation of the vaccine construct for 10 ns showed that there were very mild fluctuations in the rmsd graph, indicating the vaccine's stability (fig. 10) . the rmsf graph showed regions with high peaks, indicating the high flexibility of the vaccine construct (fig. 10) . the molecular dynamics simulation (mds) is one of the most important steps used to check the stability of the vaccine by simulating the vaccine under in vivo conditions. rmsd and rmsf data obtained from our mds is similar to the studies done by other research groups, where they have checked the stability and flexibility of the vaccine candidate mimicking the in vivo conditions 28, 87, 88 . to assure an effective expression in e. coli host, codon optimization of the designed vaccine was performed and the linear vaccine construct was reverse translated into its specific cdna sequence. the gc content of it was recorded as 58.53%, therefore showing the possibility of efficient expression of the vaccine candidate in e. coli host. further, insertion of the vaccine in the expression vector pet-28a (+) for in silico cloning was performed so that the vaccine can be expressed in bacterial system. a similar approach was used by foroutan et al. in order to optimize the codon of their designed vaccine before its in vitro expression 92 . the immune simulation studies confirmed that our designed vaccine was able to elicit specific immune responses required to clear the antigen on secondary exposure (fig. 12) , after the final injection. our immune simulation study was in fact better than the recently published work on multi-epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 where there was no live replicating virus injected after the vaccination in order to check its effectiveness on a secondary exposure with the antigen 97 .similarly, the immunoinformatic strategy of vaccine designing has recently been applied for designing multiepitope vaccines against pseudomonas aeruginosa 98 , klebsiella pneumoniae 88 , dengue 99 , nipah virus 100 , hendra virus 101 and malaria 102 . in addition, similar approach has also been applied for developing vaccine against cancerous antigens 28, 103 . the ctl, htl and ifn-γ epitopes included in the vaccine has the capacity to trigger the stimulation of host's respective immune cells which in turn can cause the activation of other immune cells via complex signalling.sequence retrieval and phylogenetic tree construction-. the vipr database (https ://www.viprb rc.org/brc/home.spg?decor ator=vipr) was used to retrieve the spike glycoprotein sequences of 7 coronaviruses (hcov-nl63, hcov-229e, hcov-0c43, hku-1, mers-cov, sars-cov and sars-cov-2) which have previously infected the human population. in addition, spike glycoprotein sequences of different strains of sars-cov-2, isolated from 19 different countries (china, japan, usa, australia, finland, sweden, india, colombia, taiwan, pakistan, italy, israel, iran, iran, vietnam, peru, brazil, spain, nepal and south korea) around the globe were also retrieved from the vipr database. two phylogeny trees were constructed and for both the trees, the muscle tool 104 was used in order to align the glycoprotein sequences and the alignment file was used to construct the phylogenetic trees with default parameters and 1,000 bootstrap replicates, using the neighbour joining algorithm of mega 7.0.14 105 t cell epitope prediction. ctl epitope prediction. 9-mer long ctl epitopes were predicted using netctl 1.2 server (https ://www.cbs.dtu.dk/servi ces/netct l/), recognized by the hla class i supertypes which are commonly occurring in human population, i.e., a1, a2, a3, a24, a26, b7, b8, b27, b39, b44, b58 and b62 106 . in the netctl 1.2 server, the thresholds were set at 0.15, 0.05 and 0.75 for distinctive parameters such as proteasomal c-terminal cleavage, transporter associated with antigen processing (tap) and epitope recognition, respectively. netctl supports epitope prediction with 54-89% sensitivity and 94-99% specificity. also, the epitopes recognized by other hla class i alleles were detected by immune epitope consensus (iedb) tool (https ://tools .iedb.org/mhci/) 107 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ htl epitope prediction. 15-mer long htl epitopes were predicted using netmhcii pan 3.2 server (www.cbs. dtu.dk/servi ces/netmh ciipa n/), which had an affinity to class ii hla alleles 108 . the predicted peptides were classified as strong, intermediate and non-binders with threshold value set at 2, 10 and > 10% respectively, based on the idea of percentile rank as given by netmhcii pan 3.2 server. the epitopes were screened on the basis of antigenicity as well as immunogenicity as predicted by vaxijen v2.0 and iedb class i immunogenicity web servers, respectively 109, 110 . the 3d structure of the spike glycoprotein was modelled using i-tasser in order to visualize the selected epitopes on the protein surface 111-113 . b cell epitope prediction-. the ellipro tool (https ://tools .iedb.org/ellip ro/) from iedb server was used for predicting linear and conformational/discontinuous b cell epitopes with default parameters 114 .ifn-γ epitope prediction. for both humoral and innate immunity, ifn-γ plays important role in antiviral, anti-tumour and immune regulatory activities. hence, ifn-γ inducing epitopes are important for designing a potential multi-epitope vaccine. from the target protein, ifnepitope server (https ://crdd.osdd.net/ragha va/ ifnep itope /) was used to predict out the ifn-γ epitopes 115 . the server has a maximum accuracy of 81.39% and various approaches such as machine learning strategy, motive-based analysis and accuracy hybrid approach is used for the prediction of the epitopes.population coverage. the iedb population coverage analysis tool (https ://tools .iedb.org/popul ation /) was used in order to check if the epitopes of the designed vaccine had effectively covered the entire world population 44 . as, sars-cov-2 is a global pandemic the population coverage was checked for the total world population, united states, europe, china, south asia and oceania. the default parameters were used and the coverage was checked against the hla class i and hla class ii binding alleles.multi-epitope vaccine construct, structural modelling and validation. the screened ctl, htl and ifn-γ inducing epitopes from the target glycoprotein were together linked by glycine-proline rich gpgpg linkers. in addition, cholera toxin b (ctb) adjuvant was added by eaaak linker to the n-terminal of the vaccine construct as it can induce regulatory immune responses. trrosetta was used to generate the 3d model of linear vaccine construct 116 . the tertiary structure was validated using errat score 38 followed by prosa-web analysis 36 . prosa-web validates the structure based on z-score predicted. further, the overall quality of the generated model of vaccine was determined by ramachandran plot analysis using rampage server 117 .physicochemical properties of the vaccine construct-. vaxijen v2.0 109 was used to check the antigenicity of the vaccine construct with a threshold value of 0.4. viral databases were used to extract whole-protein antigenicity prediction models. each set was made up of 100 identified antigens, and 100 non-antigens. the generated models were evaluated using data sets, utilizing internal leave-one-out cross-validation and external validation. the models implemented in the server worked well in both validations showing 70% to 89% predictive accuracy. also, the allergenicity of the vaccine was checked using allertop server 85 . this server employs auto-cross-covariance (acc) grouping of protein sequences into uniform equal-length vectors. this has been applied to peptide study with the various types with quantitative structure-activity relationships (qsar). the k-nearest neighbour algorithm (knn, k = 1) is used by the server to identify proteins based on a training set composed of 2,427 identified allergens and 2,427 non-allergens of various species. in addition, the allergenicity of the designed vaccine was cross checked by allergenfp server (https ://ddg-pharm fac.net/aller genfp /) 86 . other physicochemical properties like isoelectric point, molecular weight, instability index, aliphatic index, half-life and gravy score of the vaccine was assessed using expasy protparam server 89 . the vaccine construct was also checked for the presence of any signal peptides and transmembrane helices by signalp4.1 (https ://www.cbs.dtu.dk/servi ces/signa lp/) 118 and tmhmm server v2.0 (https ://www.cbs.dtu.dk/servi ces/tmhmm /) 119 , respectively. docking with tlr4 dimer, tlr2, mhc class i receptor and mhc class ii receptor. for generation of a stable immune response, it is essential for the vaccine to interact with target immune cell receptors. to study such interactions, molecular docking studies are performed. in this study, interactions of the vaccine with tlr4 dimer and tlr2 are studied as they localize on cell surface thereby inducing immune response when activated by the vaccine 120, 121 . in addition, the vaccine was also docked with mhc class i and mhc class ii receptors. tlr4 hetero-tetramer structure and tlr2 structure were obtained from protein data bank id 3fxi and id 2z7x, respectively whereas, the mhc class i and mhc class ii receptors were obtained from pdb id 1i1y and 1kg0, respectively.cport 122 was utilized for predicting the active and passive residues for the interactions. the docking of the vaccine with tlr4, tlr2, mhc class i and mhc class ii receptors were performed by haddock 2.4 (https ://www.bonvi nlab.org/softw are/haddo ck2.4/) 123 . the best cluster was chosen from the docked clusters based on lowest haddock score. haddock refinement interface was used to refine the chosen cluster. the best structure after refinement from each docked complex were chosen and their binding affinity was calculated using prodigy web server 124, 125 . finally, the interacting residues between the vaccine and the tlrs were mapped using pdbsum (https ://www.ebi.ac.uk/thorn ton-srv/datab ases/pdbsu m/gener ate.html) 126 .chemical simulations), a linux-based program was used for the molecular dynamics simulation (mds) andscientific reports | (2020) 10:10895 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67749-1 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ energy minimisation 127 . mds was done for the vaccine structure in order to see how it behaves in the in vivo biological system. opls-aa (optimized potential for liquid simulation-all atom) force field constrain was used to generate the topology file required for energy minimization and equilibration. an equilibrated three-point water model, spc216 was used as the solvent to simulate the vaccine with periodic boundary conditions. the net charge of the vaccine construct was evaluated, and charged ions were added in order to neutralize the system. the simulation run was performed for 10 ns of the energy minimised structure in order to find the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of backbone and root mean square fluctuation (rmsf) of side chain. the graphs were visualized using xmgrace plotting tool 128 .reverse translation, codon optimization and in silico cloning of the vaccine. the java codonadaptation tool (jcat) (https ://www.jcat.de/) was used for codon optimization and reverse translation which generated the cdna sequence of the vaccine that can be used for an efficient expression in e. coli k-12 strain 129 . the result consists of gc content and codon adaptation index (cai) score, that can be used to assess protein expression levels. in addition, the optimized multi-epitope vaccine sequence was inserted into the pet-28a (+) vector by snapgene tool.immune simulation. c-immsim server (https ://krake n.iac.rm.cnr.it/c-immsi m/) was used for performing the immune simulation of the vaccine, in order to characterize the immune response profile and immunogenicity of the chimeric peptides 53 . c-immsim is an agent-based model that uses position-specific scoring matrices (pssm) for peptide prediction derived from machine learning techniques for predicting immune interactions. the minimum recommended time between dose 1 and dose 2 for most of the vaccines currently in use, is 4 weeks 130 the current global pandemic of covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2 is to date un-controllable with high death rate. no proper medical preventives like vaccines are given to the patients yet for recovery. application of in silico methods can be used to design an effective vaccine in lesser time and low cost. in this study, immunoinformatic tools are used for constructing a multi-epitope vaccine against sars-cov-2 consisting of ctl, htl and ifn-γ epitopes that can trigger strong immune responses. the designed multi-epitope vaccine was found to be both antigenic and immunogenic. the stability of the designed vaccine was assured by molecular dynamics simulation and a stable interaction of the vaccine with immune receptors was confirmed by molecular docking studies. further, in silico expression studies confirmed the vaccine's expression in bacterial host and the efficiency of the vaccine to trigger an immune response was validated by immune simulation studies.scientific reports | (2020) 10:10895 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67749-1 www.nature.com/scientificreports/the n-terminal of the sequence considered is m (met).the estimated half-life is: 30 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro). >20 hours (yeast, in vivo). >10 hours (escherichia coli, in vivo).the instability index (ii) is computed to be 31.04 this classifies the protein as stable. december 2019 has turned in to a global catastrophe (1) . the virus has been designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) and the disease caused by the agent as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) (2). world health organization (who) pronounced the disease as a pandemic on march 11, 2020 (3) . as of may 4 th, 2020, the infection has spread to 212 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances, with over 3.5 million cases and around two hundred fifty-thousand deaths (4) . the disease on average affects over 33,000 individuals with over 1300 deaths daily. the world community has responded to the challenge of death and devastation with resilience and determination (5) . governments have implemented lockdown measures, blocked international travel, and enforced other public containment measures to mitigate the virus morbidity and mortality (6) (7) (8) . there has been a major understanding of the disease as well as the pathogen and these data have been generated and widely publicized in a matter of days and weeks rather than years and decades, an unprecedented occurrence in the history of medicine (9) (10) (11) (12) .coronavirus family. sars-cov-2 belongs to a family of zoonotic viruses known as coronavirus, genus betacononavirus and is closely related to two other viruses namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) (13) . all three are bat viruses and cross over to cause human infection through an intermediate host (civets for sars-cov, camels for mers-cov, and possibly pangolins for sars-cov-2) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, around 125 nm in diameter, with a positive-sense singlestranded rna genome of around 30kb and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. this is wrapped in an icosahedral protein shell. the surface has multiple clubshaped spikes, which creates the appearance of solar corona on em. the viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer, in which the membrane (m), envelope (e) and spike (s) structural proteins are anchored. all the coronaviruses use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors as a cellular entry receptor, however, the propensity of sars-cov-2 to attach to these receptors is much higher, giving it high infectivity (13) .need for coronavirus vaccine. there has been an intensive search for an effective drug against the virus or the resultant disease and has not led to any breakthrough agents. few drugs namely hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir have been advocated as desperate measures to fight covid-19 based on a few preliminary, contradictory, and inconclusive studies (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . what we need is a drug that is at least 95% effective to stop the pandemic. these and other drugs may save lives but are nowhere near that power to bring normalcy in the utter chaos caused by the pandemic (24). this leaves us with only one choice namely an effective and safe vaccine that shall be manufactured as soon as possible and available to all countries and populations affected by the pandemic at an affordable price (25, 26) . a vaccine has the power to generate herd immunity in the communities, which will reduce the incidence of disease, block transmission, and reduce the social and economic burden of the disease. very high immunization coverage can effectively fight the pandemic, prevent secondary waves of infection, and control the seasonal endemic infection outbursts. eventually, the disease can be eradicated as has happened in many other diseases that have had even with higher potential than covid-19 to cause pandemics namely smallpox, poliomyelitis, etc (27, 28).adaptive immune response. a vaccine is medical preparations ranging from intact organisms (attenuated live, or inactivated) to genetically engineered parts of the organisms (antigenic) that induce both arms of the adaptive immune system and stimulate a sufficient number of memory t cells and b lymphocytes (29) . vaccines should contain antigens necessary to mount the specific response without causing disease. once challenged with the pathogen, memory cells yield effector t cells and antibody-producing b cells and fight the infection. the antibodies have to be the neutralizing type which binds to the virus and block infection (30) . the virus coated with neutralizing antibodies either cannot interact with the receptor or may be unable to uncoat of the genome. most currently licensed vaccines to induce neutralizing antibody responses capable of mediating long-term protection against lytic viruses such as influenza and smallpox (31) . the t cell-based responses that recognize and kill infected cells do also fight the infection (32) . following antigen processing in dendritic cells, the small peptides are displayed at the cell surface at the groove of major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i and class ii molecules. cytotoxic t cells (cd8 +) recognize mhc class i-peptide complexes and differentiate into cytotoxic effector cells capable of killing infected cells or pathogens. helper t cells (cd4 +) recognize mhc class iipeptide complexes and differentiate in effector cells that produce preferentially t helper th1 or th2 cytokines (fig 1) . t helper cells 1 (th1) support cd8 + t-cell differentiation, which is in contrast inhibited by t helper cells 2 (th2) like cytokines. vaccines against chronic pathogens namely mycobacterium tuberculosis, malaria, hcv, hiv, etc more often require cell-mediated immune responses to control the infection (33) .vaccine-preventable diseases. the success of a vaccine against a pathogen is a complex issue and depends upon the biology of the virus and the type of immune response elicited by the body against the organism. while vaccines have been successful against several pathogens including 14 major infectious diseases (27, 28) , not all infectious diseases are vaccine-preventable (34, 35) . the development of vaccines against hiv and hcv have proved challenging. these viruses have an extreme genetic heterogeneity including the hypervariable regions (target for neutralizing antibodies) and the mutation contribute to immune escape (36) . the mutations lead to a mixture of genomes in the patient over time and from patient to patient. also, antibodies mounted against such viral infections are predominantly non-neutralizing. neutralizing antibodies are often either absent or weak to fight the pathogen or neutralize only a narrow range of circulating viral strains and only appear in a subgroup of patients who either recover or are 'elite controller' (37) . another aspect to be considered is whether the virus can be grown in cell culture and transmitted to small animals for experimentation. since hcv has been discovered by molecular cloning in 1989, its propagation in cell culture has been difficult which hampers the ability of investigators to experiment with various antigenic components of the virus (38) .to develop a safe and effective vaccine against covid-19, we need to consider several things about the sars-cov-2 and the immune response against the natural infection and the vaccine.mutations. does sars-cov-2 mutate, how fast and will mutations cause a phenomenon of immune escape as is seen in hiv and hcv (34, 35) . sars-cov-2 has shown mutations as is true to every rna virus. however, the mutations are slow, mild and mutants show nearly similar sequences as in the parent strain. dorp et al (39) studied genomic diversity of sars-cov-2 and recorded 198 filtered recurrent mutations, however, most of the mutations were either neutral or even deleterious and of no clinical significance in vaccine immunity. ahmad et al (40) found no mutations in 120 available sars-cov-2 sequences and identified a set of b cell and t cell epitopes derived from the spike (s) and nucleoprotein(n) proteins that map identically to sars-cov-2 proteins. these findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against sars-cov-2.what type of immune response occurs in natural covid-19 and after vaccination and are antibodies neutralizing in nature? sars-cov-2 infection evokes a robust adaptive immune response of both t cell and b cell type arms (41, 42) . furthermore, both igm and igg antibodies appear around the 10 th day of infection and most patients seroconvert within 3 weeks. the antibodies are raised against internal nucleoprotein (n) and spike protein (s) of the virion and have neutralizing activity (43) . now that several candidate vaccines are in the clinical trial, investigators shall study the strength and nature of immune response against the vaccine antigen (mostly spike protein).are people who recover from covid-19 infection protected from a second or a third infection? should reinfections occur it would imply that immune response against sars-cov-2 is not protective, making possibilities of a successful vaccine difficult. there were scary reports from south korea about patients thought to have recovered from covid-19 had tested positive again (44) . an intense debate started about re-activation or re-infections of the virus. soon these reports were put to rest and the positive sample were found to be residual dead fragments of the virus, not the virus, which had reactivated or re-infected (45) . after these reports, two groups of investigators have shown that sars-cov-2 antibodies are protective. bao et al showed that 2 monkeys who recovered from sars-cov-2 infection were protected from re-infection on the challenge during convalescence (46). gao et al administered candidate vaccine picovacc sinovac biotech to mice, rats, and non-human primates. the antibodies raised against the vaccine in animals showed neutralizing ability against sars-cov-2 strains. three immunizations of two doses (3µg or 6µg per dose) gave partial or complete protection in macaques against sars-cov-2 (47). these data are exciting and if reproducible in humans confirm that vaccines against covid-19 shall be protective.for the covid-19 vaccination program to succeed, the antibody response mounted against the virus/vaccine must be long-lasting. as of today, it is not possible to address this question as the virus has been in the community only for the last few months. however, we can take leads from data generated about the duration of immunity against 2 other coronaviruses namely sars-cov and mers-cov (14, 17) . both these viruses, which are closely related to sars-cov-2 induce a robust t cell and b cell immune response which is long-lasting. many candidate vaccines against both these viruses had gone through successful clinical trials and are safe and immunogenic (48) .the greatest fear among vaccine developers is to create a vaccine that does not protect from infection but causes disease exacerbation, increased morbidity, and mortality (48) (49) (50) (51) . some vaccines can mount antibody-dependent enhancement (ade), which negates the basic purpose of vaccination (52). this response is mediated by the type of non-neutralizing antibodies mounted against infection or vaccination. the immune response to such vaccines is subverted, leading to exacerbated illness. this could be due to fc receptor-or complement bearing cells-mediated mechanisms. the fc-region of the antibody binds to fcγr on the immune cells, which subverts the immune response by reducing t h 1 cytokines (il2, tnf-a, and ifn-g) and skews t h 2 cytokines (il-10, il-6, pge-2, and inf-a) and inhibits stat pathway leading to increased viral replication (fig 2) . ade is of clinical significance in several viral infections including influenza, rsv, sars-cov, mers-cov, dengue virus, zika virus, and west nile virus. considering ade is a major impediment to vaccine development, efforts to identify highly selected epitopes have been done to avoid the production of antibodies responsible for disease enhancement.ade has been reported in animals during vaccination trials with sars-cov and mers-cov (14, 17, 35) . vaccine candidates against coronaviruses based on full-length spike protein induce non-neutralizing antibodies, lack of protection of animals against a viral challenge, and severe disease enhancement presenting as enhanced hepatitis, increased morbidity, and stronger inflammatory response (17) . as of today, there are no reports of ade with the use of covid-19 candidate vaccines in non-human primates and humans (51) . however, it is an early period in the development of these vaccines and as the matter is of major importance in the success of such a vaccine, we need to be vigilant. ade following covid-19 vaccination if reported can be prevented by shielding non-neutralizing epitopes of s protein by glycosylation or selecting critical neutralizing epitopes of the s antigen to elicit a more robust protective immunity.stages of vaccine development. every new vaccine follows a stringent protocol in r&d which has to be meticulously followed and completed before it is licensed to be marketed (fig 3) . costs. it has also to be considered that vaccine development is a high cost and high-risk involvement (59) . apart from competition between other major vaccine manufacturers, the cost of developing a single new vaccine against an infectious disease exceeds us $i billion. the technology behind the development of vaccines in research and development (r&d) has seen a transformation in the recent past. over the year's candidate vaccines were made through traditional methods of biotechnology. because of this making of a prototype vaccine took between 2 to 5 years and was limited to a few types of vaccines. it needed the availability of cutting-edge research facilities to work with the infectious agent and was possible only in few laboratories over the globe (58, 59) . recently platform technology has been employed in developing candidate vaccines (63, 64). platform technology offers several advantages in the development of vaccines which include automation, speed, ability to develop several prototype vaccines from the single system, cost-effectiveness, and developing among other complex mrna vaccines with ease. it is believed that the mrna-based vaccine developed by platform technology appears particularly promising in terms of ease of manufacture, adaptability to various targets, and biological delivery (65) . as candidate vaccines can be developed in a matter of days rather than years, the platform technology has been termed as a single game-changer in the fight against epidemics or pandemics caused by new agents (66-68). (table 2) . each vaccine design has a subtle structure, advantages, and disadvantages in immunogenicity, safety, ease of use, and effectiveness (fig 1) (29, 69, 70 ).live attenuated vaccine is developed by the process in which the live virus is passed through animal or human cells until genome mutates and is unable to cause disease. the weekend virus replicates like a natural infection and causes strong t cell and b cell immune response, which is long-lasting. such vaccines are good to attain herd immunity in the population and block transmission of disease. however, there is a small chance of reversion of mutation to virulence and the occurrence of disease. besides, such vaccines need a cold chain for distribution to the community. examples of such vaccines are bcg, smallpox, mmr (measles, mumps & rubella), rotavirus, poliomyelitis (opv), etc. inactivated vaccines are treated with formaldehyde or heat and as the virus is killed such vaccines are safe and cannot cause disease. however, such vaccines do not replicate, cause a suboptimum immune response, and need repeated dosing and adjuvants to enhance immunity. antibody-dependant enhancement has been reported in such vaccines and to avoid this, we need to maintain the structure of epitopes on the surface antigen during inactivation. examples of such vaccines include poliomyelitis (ipv), hav, rabies, etc. subunit vaccines composed of purified antigen peptides of viruses like spike protein of sars-cov-2 and are safe to use. such an antigen is directly presented to mch class ii and often does not generate a robust cytotoxic t cell response (mhc class i dependant). thus, such vaccines need repeated dosing and adjuvants to enhance immunity. virus-like particles are made from empty virus particles without genetic material. such vaccines are safe and immunogenic, however, are difficult to manufacture.there has been unprecedented fast track path taken in r&d by the world community for developing candidate covid-19 vaccines. as of 5 may 2020, the global covid-19 vaccine r&d includes 108 candidate vaccines (71) . the platform for 108 candidate vaccines are diverse and include live attenuated vaccine (n= 3), inactivated vaccine (n=7), dna vaccine (n=10), rna vaccine (n=16), replicating viral vector vaccine (n=12), nonreplicating viral vector vaccine (n=15), protein subunit vaccine (n=36), virus-like particles (n=6) and unknown (n=3). these platforms have been used in the past in 45 instances against a variety of infectious pathogens.up till now, several candidate vaccines have completed the exploratory and preclinical stage, obtained clinical trial authorization, and initiated recruitment of volunteers for clinical trials (72) . of these six candidate vaccines stand at the forefront of clinical trials (table 2) .ad5-ncov from cansino biologicals inc. is a recombinant vaccine using adenovirus-vector. cansino has an adenovirus-vector vaccine for ebola (ad5-ebov) that is in phase ii trials. phase i trial has been completed on 108 volunteers; however, results have not been disclosed as of today. at present phase ii trials are underway and cansino plans to enroll 500 volunteers to evaluate vaccine safety and immunogenicity (73, 74) .mrna-1273 from moderna is a lipid encapsulated mrna vaccine and is undergoing safety and immune response phase i trial in seattle. the company has filed for an ind to go for parallel phase ii trials (61, 75) .picovacc from sinovac biotech is an inactivated virus vaccine and is undergoing parallel phase i-ii trials planned on 144 volunteers. sinovac has partnered with us-based dynavax. the vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats, and rhesus monkey which are protective in challenge experiments (47, 76) .chadox1 from the university of oxford is an adenovirus vector-based vaccine and plans to run parallel phase i-ii trials on 510 volunteers for safety and efficacy. the oxford group has experience with candidate vaccine for mers-cov (chadox-mers) and has undergone a successful phase i trial for safety. the group is pushing ahead with an aggressive clinical plan and is talking of an emergency-use vaccine ready in september 2020 (77) (78) (79) .bnt162 (a1, b1, b2, c2) from biontehc is another lipid nanoparticle mrna vaccine and has received clearance from regulatory authority form germany to the start of phase i-ii trials on 196 volunteers. the trial is dose escalation design (1 to 100 mcg) using 4 vaccine subtypes (a1, b1, b2, and c2). the developers have claimed to have an emergency-use vaccine by september 2020 (80) .ino-4800 from inovio is a dna plasmid vaccine. the company has experience with such platforms with candidate vaccines for mers and sars. the vaccine needs a delivery system through electroporation, which shall add to the cost of the vaccine. phase i trial using two doses spaced four weeks apart has been completed and results shall be available in june 2020. inovio is planning to start phase ii-iii trials soon (81) .numerous developers at present in the preclinical stage of vaccine development have indicated to procure 'clinical trial authorization' by the regulatory agencies and initiate 'first-in-human vaccine' testing.a race against time in the middle of death and devastation. covid-19 vaccine development has thrown major challenges in vaccine r&d (82) . the world is facing a major health catastrophe and economic devastation and one of the definitive solutions is to have an effective and safe vaccine in the shortest possible time. the global vaccine r&d efforts have been unprecedented in history. the virus causing cvoid-19 has been sequenced in a few weeks. ordinarily, it has taken from 5 to 10 years to clone and sequence a virus from the time the disease is discovered. there has been a tremendous race against time, to develop candidate vaccine in a matter of few weeks and as of now, 10 candidate vaccines have entered phase i-ii clinical trials. it has taken us from 5 to 10 years in the history of vaccine development against other infectious agents to reach a stage as we are now with the covid-19 vaccine. however, clinical trials as are undergoing now will be the greatest limiting factor, as these need time to acquire human data. normally phase i, ii, and iii trials to be done on humans are completed between 2 to 5 years and sometimes more. this is necessary for qualifying a vaccine to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious. as of today, candidate vaccines are undergoing phase i or parallel i-ii studies and shall take several months for acquiring these data to start phase iii trials. phase iii trial once initiated can take as long as 2 years.to compress the period vaccine developers are involved in adopting parallel and adaptive development phases (i-ii) to acquire safety and immunogenicity data as soon as possible to initiate phase iii trials. by any imagination, these data shall not be available by early 2021 for any vaccine for regulatory authorities to allow vaccine marketing. covid-19 vaccines could be available for human use earlier if innovative methods of clinical trials and regulatory processes are employed. one such is the use of 'challenge studies' to testify vaccine efficacy (56) . here, following proof of safety and immunogenicity in phase i-ii trials, controlled 'challenge studies' which can be completed in a matter of weeks, are done to confirm vaccine efficacy. challenge studies have been done in the past in other infectious diseases namely influenza, typhoid fever, cholera, and malaria. whether 'challenge studies' are ethical in covid-19, considering the risk to the volunteer is a matter of debate before the vaccine developers (83) .also, regularity authorities can use innovative procedures to allow guarded emergency use of a vaccine. this would need careful consideration of interventional animal safety data and data of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy acquired from phase i-ii trials. with all this, vaccine developers have to be ready to scale manufacturing capacity to massive demands once the product is allowed for marketing (25) .no 'quick fix' and 'short cuts' please. however, concerns are raised about a rush to deploy a covid-19 vaccine. applying 'quick fix' and 'short cuts'can lead to errors with disastrous consequences (84) . what regulators have to worry about is the atmosphere of hype about the covid-19 vaccine? public claims about breakthrough research based on poorly conducted studies or data collected through fraud is a real possibility. all data which form the basis of any findings need to be scrutinized and should be confirmed by other investigators. relaxion on regulatory principles based on political pressure and goodwill needs to be resisted and one needs to protect the interests of volunteers who are a part of such experiments (85) . lastly, vaccine development is a risky process, and one critical issue in the covid-19 vaccine would-be the occurrence of 'antibody-dependent enhancement (ade)' which may be disastrous for those receiving the vaccine (49, 50) . regulators have to take all precautions to discourage candidate vaccines which may show such a phenomenon. the basis for approval-the vaccine is safe and effective in humans (efficacy >95%). capacity to produce in bulk for market demand.

(sars) in wuhan, china was reported by the health commission of hubei 33 province, china. this severe respiratory illness was identified by multiple diagnostic methods as an 34 infection by a novel coronavirus (1) (2) (3) (4) , which was temporarily denoted as 2019-ncov by world 35 health organization (5) ， and renamed "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" against sars-cov using their own vaccine platforms (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) . however, most vaccines are in preclinical studies, and only a few of them have been reported to under assessment in clinical trials 111 (https://clinical trials.gov/ct2/show/nct03615911; https://clinical trials.gov/ct2/show/nct0339578). 112 currently, no vaccine has been approved for the prevention of sars. since effective antiviral 113 strategies to control sars-cov and sars-cov-2 infections are still lacking, vaccination is still 114 regarded as the major approach for preventing potential re-emergence of sars-cov, and more 129 it is known that most of the current influenza vaccines are inactivated vaccines, which plays a and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity (61, 62) . generally, the s protein 189 of coronavirus is functionally divided into the s1 subunit, responsible for receptor binding, and the generating s1 and s2 subunits is located at r694/s695 (67) . in addition, it has been reported that s 193 protein has strong immunogenicity and can induce high titer neutralizing antibody (63) . rbd of 194 sars-cov s1 is located in s318-510 and the key rbm is s425-494, of which r453 is critical for for the whole protein, around 73%-76% for the rbd, and 50%-53% for the rbm (7, 30) .in s1 subunit, sars-cov-2 and sars-cov shared around 50 conserved amino acids, and the 204 three-dimensional structure of sars-cov-2 rbd was composed of a core and an external 205 subdomain, which was more similar to that of sars-cov (29) . we aligned the sequence of s protein protective immunity (35, (78) (79) (80) . for example, the expression of full-length s protein and its trimer of recombinant s1 or s2 proteins, respectively, and found that anti-s1 and anti-s2 iggs were able to 304 abolish the binding between s protein and its cellular receptor(s), although anti-s1 igg showed a 305 significantly higher blocking efficiency (106) . as shown in figure 2b , the amino acid sequences of 306 hr1 and hr2 are highly conserved and homologous between sars-cov and sars-cov-2. in fact, 307 these domains are also highly conserved in other coronaviruses (104) , thus the s2 subunit has potential 308 to be used as a target for the development of pan-cov vaccine against divergent virus strains.altogether, these results suggested that the s2 domain of sars-cov s protein, as a vaccine rbds. the red number indicates the core amino acids in rbd when it binds to receptor ace2. the green frame is the amino acid sequence of rbm. b. sequence alignment of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 hr1. the red frame is the location where the variable amino acid residues between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 hr1.ann arvin (stanford university, ca, usa) presented us the latest on varicella zoster vaccine development [1]. in 1995, the food and drug administration (fda) approved the use of a live-attenuated (la) varicella zoster virus (vzv, oka-strain) vaccine. vaccination has now commenced in many countries. after 6 years of clinical practice it is now clear that the vaccine is 85% effective in providing protection against infection with wild-type (wt) virus, and 95% efficacious in protection against serious disease. breakthrough infections of vaccine virus occurred in 1–2% of the vaccinees and were generally very mild.zoster, caused by the reactivation of vzv from latency, is a common among hematopoietic-cell transplant recipients. vaccination with inactivated vzv vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of zoster in these individuals, which correlated with reconstitution of vzv-specific cd4 t-cell immunity [2].stanley plotkin addressed the latest developments on vaccination against cytomegalovirus (cmv) [3]. congenital infections with cmv are the most common cause of neurological disorders in infants. in the united states, cmv is transmitted in 1% of all births causing death or sequala in 20% of these cases. to prevent these deaths as well as cmv infection in transplants recipient patients researchers have started to explore the possibilities for vaccination against cmv. currently, four different cmv candidate vaccines are tested in phase i and ii trials. the la vaccine, based on the towne strain, induced good immunity, including neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity, which correlate with protection. however, the immune response lagged behind that of a natural infection. to increase the immunogenicity of the towne la vaccine, which lacks nineteen open reading frames (orf) and lost its capacity to establish latency, some of the orf of the more virulent toledo strain of cmv will be introduced into the towne vaccine strain. in addition to these two candidate la vaccines, a sub-unit candidate vaccine comprising of the gb glycoprotein and a canarypox vector containing the pp65 and iei exon 4 are being tested in phase i trials. the former induces antibodies, whereas the latter induces a strong cellular immune response.at the other end of the age spectrum are the elderly, which generally have a reduced immune function of the innate and adaptive immune system. this so-called immunosenescence is the cause of increased morbidity and mortality in this age group. because of the reduced immune function, vaccine efficacies are often lower in the elderly and vaccines have to be more immunogenic to obtain similar seroconversion rates. michael roggendorf (university of essen, essen, germany) showed that the immunogenicity of hepatitis a virus (hav) and hepatitis b virus (hbv) vaccine is lower in the elderly, as was measured by seroconversion rates [4]. interestingly, the efficacy of the hav and hbv vaccine differed in individuals over 60 years of age, (71 and 37.5% seroconversion, respectively), which may be dependent on the nature of the vaccine formulations. lluis salleras (autonomous government of catalonia, barcelona, spain) further elaborated on vaccine efficacy and demonstrated that hav and hbv vaccination in pre-adolescent schoolchildren was >90% effective in protection from disease [5].respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) is a single-stranded negative sense rna virus belonging to the family of paramyxoviridae, genus pneumovirus. upon infection, the virus can cause upper respiratory tract disease in all age groups, however severe complications are more often seen in the very young, elderly and bone marrow transplant patients. in the late 1960s, vaccination experiments were conducted in young children using formalin-inactivated rsv (fi-rsv). upon infection with a wt strain of rsv, some of these children suffered from severe complications resulting in death. this phenomenon of enhanced disease in fi-rsv vaccinated children has hampered further rsv vaccine research enormously.understanding the mechanisms of disease enhancement is a key issue, crucial to rsv vaccine development. peter openshaw and his co-workers have been studying enhanced disease in mice for many years. the possible involvement of γδ t cells in human bronchiolitis has recently been highlighted [6], and depletion of these ’unconventional’ t cells can prevent enhanced disease in rsv-infected mice previously sensitized by scarification with vaccinia viruses encoding single rsv proteins.among the target population for vaccination are very young children (under 1 year of age). the presence of maternal antibodies and the immaturity of the immune system may reduce the immunogenicity of vaccines in these children. james crowe investigated the ability of b cells from very young children to produce neutralizing antibodies, which are important for protective immunity. following natural infections, the immunoglobulin (ig) region of b cells producing rsv-specific antibodies was sequenced. gene rearrangements resulting in a complete vdj region in the immunoglobulin occurred in the rsv-specific b cells. however, b cells from infants less than 3 months old exhibited a striking paucity of somatic mutations in vh genes, indicating that they are unable to produce high quality neutralizing antibodies.potential vaccine candidates for rsv include adenovirus recombinants, immune stimulating complex (iscom) preparations and sub-unit vaccines, as well as la virus vaccines. la virus vaccines are known to induce humoral and cellular immune responses. a presentation by miranda de graaf (erasmus mc, rotterdam, netherlands) demonstrated the possibilities of reverse genetics in creating la viruses. this work was done using human metapneumovirus (hmpv), a virus causing similar disease as rsv. exchanging the polymerase genes between the two different lineages of hmpv attenuated the ability to induce chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) activity from a mini-genome containing a cat reporter gene flanked by the hmpv genomic ends. using the full-length hmpv genome instead of a reporter gene resulted in the rescue of recombinant viable viruses [7]. this system could produce attenuated viruses that may be used for vaccine purposes.passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies is an available treatment for rsv. because of the relatively short half-life of these antibodies, it is essential that the administration of the antibodies coincide with the rsv epidemic season, of which the onset varies from year-to-year. the pid-ari network (pediatric infectious diseases network on acute respiratory tract infections) currently identifies 19 different viral and bacterial pathogens, using a multiplex pcr, in children between 0 and 16 years old. josef weigl (christian albrechts university, kiel, germany) showed that last year the start of the rsv epidemic was 5 weeks prior to the onset of antibody administration, unnecessarily endangering these children to an infection with rsv. these data support the need to synchronize the application of preventive antibody treatment with rsv epidemics.finally, rob moormann (animal sciences group of wageningen, lelystad, netherlands) presented the latest on bovine rsv vaccine development. vaccination with fi-rsv induced enhanced disease in these animals, including eosinophil influx and an ige response [8].a second important respiratory pathogen is influenza virus. this segmented negative sense single-stranded rna virus has been responsible for three major pandemics in the 20th century as well as annual epidemics. in contrast to rsv, the correlates of protection are well documented and include the presence of neutralizing antibodies and probably t-cell responses. influenza vaccine research is focusing on two areas; the development of an influenza vaccine for a pandemic situation and the development of alternative influenza vaccines preventing disease following infection with epidemic viruses annually.the classical influenza vaccine is a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and is administered each year by injection. harry greenberg (stanford university school of medicine, ca, usa) gave an overview on the development of a cold-adapted (ca) influenza vaccine (flumist™), which is now approved by the fda for use in individuals between 5 and 49 years of age. ca viruses are capable of growing at low temperatures (25 °c), and are attenuated at body temperatures. the genetic basis of attenuation for influenza a virus a/ann arbor/6/60 has now been identified and was limited to 4 amino-acid (aa) changes on the polymerase proteins pb1 (3 aa) and pb2 (1 aa) as well as 1 aa change on the nucleoprotein (np) [9]. flumist™ is applied intranasally, has been shown to be effective and has a low transmission rate in highly susceptible young children in a day care setting. in the future, the medical importance of a possible association between asthma and the use of flumist™ in young children needs to be investigated. finally, additional data confirming and extending the apparent safety and efficacy of flumist™ in individuals over 50 years of age should be obtained.the production of influenza vaccines in embryonated chicken eggs and the generation of master reassortant vaccine strains are time consuming and inflexible procedures are hampering the rapid development of pandemic influenza vaccines. the advent of vero and madin–darby canine kidney (mdck) cell lines, registered for vaccine production, will facilitate flexible vaccine production in the future by companies like baxter vaccines ag and solvay pharmaceuticals bv [10], [11]. reverse genetics will be an alternative tool for the generation of reassortant vaccine strains. john wood (national institute for biological standards and control, london, uk) elaborated on the possibilities of these new approaches and pointed out that licensing issues should be dealt with in order to make quick licensing of candidate vaccines possible in events of a future pandemic threat [12], [13].catherine ammon (mph, geneva, switzerland) discussed the poor public awareness of the dangers of influenza amongst swiss elderly [14]. although the elderly realized that they belong to the high-risk group, bad experiences, doubt about the efficacy, and side effects, had reduced the number of individuals willing to take the vaccine. to ensure effective use of influenza vaccines, it is imperative that public awareness is increased and maintained at a high level.dengue virus is a serious health threat to the human population infecting 50–100 million individuals each year worldwide. robert putnak (walter reed army institute of research, md, usa) presented an overview of dengue virus vaccine candidates, which are currently being tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials.one of the major issues concerning dengue virus infections is the occurrence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (dhf) and dengue shock syndrome (dss) in a small percentage of infected individuals. dhf and dss can occur after a primary infection, but occur much more frequently after secondary dengue virus infections with a serotype different from that during primary infection. it was suggested that antibody mediated enhancement and waning immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of these complications. early dengue virus candidate vaccines consisted of la virus strains, developed by dr. a. sabin. vaccination studies demonstrated that la candidate vaccines partially protected against challenge with live virus, was safe, well tolerated and immunogenic.since the who resolution on dengue virus in 1995, four different candidate vaccines are currently being evaluated in pre-clinical and clinical trials, including two candidate la virus vaccines and two recombinant candidate vaccines. the monovalent la vaccine candidates varied in immunogenicity and the four serotypes of dengue virus interfered with each other. multiple doses of vaccine, given >3 months apart, were required to obtain satisfying seroconversion rates. a recombinant dengue virus serotype 4 (den-4δ30) developed by the national institute of health is also a promising candidate, inducing a 95–100% seroconversion rate in human volunteers. a recombinant yellow-fever (yf) virus containing the prm and envelop (e) protein of dengue virus (chimerivax™, konstantin pugachev (acambis inc., ma, usa)) proved to have potential: a single dose with all four serotypes provided 83–100% protection against challenge infection 180 days later in cynomolguos macaques [15]. also candidate sub-unit vaccines have been developed for dengue virus. carolyn weeks-levy (hawaii biotech inc., hi, usa) presented data on a sub-unit candidate vaccine consisting of recombinant envelope protein (e) lacking the transmembrane region. interestingly, monkeys vaccinated with high doses of monovalent serotype 2 dengue virus (den-2) e protein, became viremic upon infection with den-2, while lower vaccine dosages did not result in viremia. addition of non-structural (ns)-1 protein increased the cellular immune response and improved protective immunity.wellington sun (walter reed army institute of research, md, usa) compared candidate dengue virus vaccine efficacies observed in humans and monkeys. monkeys are permissive for infection with dengue virus, but they do not show any disease symptoms, including dhf or dss. upon infection these animals clear the virus and develop antibodies that are partially cross-protective. at present it is unclear whether the monkey model is valid for predicting the outcome of vaccination in humans [16]. seroconversion rates of mono- and tetravalent candidate vaccines were generally lower in humans than in monkeys. the den-4δ30 and the chimerivax™-d2 (a recombinant yf virus containing the prm and envelop (e) protein of dengue virus serotype 2) candidate vaccines elicited seroconversion rates in humans of >95%. the walter reed group has conducted a serotype 1 dengue (den-1) and serotype 3 dengue (den-3) virus challenge study of subjects vaccinated with their tetravalent la candidate vaccine. results indicated that the rhesus monkey viremia correlated well with results in humans. although the human challenge model is important in validating vaccine efficacies, its role in vaccine development remains to be defined.regina kofler (university of vienna, vienna, austria) described the isolation of an attenuated tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev), with a deletion in the capsid protein. second-site mutations have restored the capacity of this attenuated virus to replicate in cell-culture. these mutants were shown to have the potential for the development of a live flavivirus vaccine [17].yf virus strain 17d (yf-17d) is an attenuated virus strain, which has lost the viscerotropic, neurotropic and vector competence phenotypes of wild-type yf virus and has been used as a backbone in vaccines for the induction of immunity against other flaviviruses. therefore full understanding of the molecular determinants for attenuation and virulence is of importance. alan barrett (university of texas medical branch, galveston, usa) showed that none of the 20 aa substitutions in yf-17d could be linked to neuro- and hepatotropism, however the e and ns4b protein may be important in determining the virus phenotype [18], [19].the second member of the flaviviridae family with a high impact on human health is hepatitis c virus (hcv). it was originally identified in 1989 and believed to have infected over 200 million people worldwide. approximately 15–45% of the hcv acute infections are resolved spontaneously, which appears to be associated with strong cd4+ t-helper cell and antibody responses. currently, the main aim of vaccination is to prevent the occurrence of chronic liver disease after infection with hcv.since chimpanzees are the only other species than humans susceptible for infection, they are used to evaluate the efficacy of hcv candidate vaccines. michael houghton (chiron corporation, ca, usa) demonstrated that vaccination with adjuvated recombinant glycoprotein (gp) e1 and e2 and subsequent challenge with hcv rna, significantly reduced the incidence of chronic disease in chimpanzees [20]. in the same study, sterile immunity was associated with high levels of neutralizing antibodies. these neutralizing antibodies may prevent binding of hcv particles to cd80, as was demonstrated in vitro with hyper-immune serum from infected individuals. currently, the gpe1 and gpe2 sub-unit candidate vaccine is being tested in phase i trials.in 1999, west nile virus (wnv) was introduced in the usa, which has prompted an extra effort to develop a vaccine. wnv is transmitted from birds to humans by mosquitoes and causes febrile illness in approximately 20% of infected individuals. in 0.8% of the infected individuals, infection results in neurological disorders followed by death in 5–15% of these cases. michael lieberman (hawaii biotech inc., hi, usa) showed that vaccination with truncated e protein of wnv protected golden hamsters from infection with wnv [21], [22]. further evaluation of this candidate sub-unit vaccine, the acambis chimeric, and the fort dodge killed candidate vaccine will be needed to demonstrate their safety and efficacy in humans.lorne babiuk (university of saskatoon, sask., canada) introduced the field of veterinary vaccinology. veterinary vaccines also have to be safe, efficacious and perhaps in contrast to vaccines for human use, generally have to be cheap and fit existing practices. furthermore, veterinary vaccines can often be evaluated directly in the targeted species. in addition to conventional live and inactivated vaccines, also genetically engineered chimeric, dna, plant-based and replication defective veterinary vaccines are available. some of these vaccines aim at the induction of protective immunity to human pathogens in order to prevent the contamination of food and water by these agents, which also include the bacteria escherichia coli (e. coli) strain o157, campylobacter and salmonella [23].the alvac vector or canarypox vector is one of the vectors used for veterinary vaccines. among its many advantages are the inability to replicate in mammalian cells, its large coding capacity, induction of low levels of vector immunity and its ability to overcome maternal antibodies. huw hughes (merial, lyon, france) demonstrated that a registered alvac vector expressing the hemagglutinin (ha) of influenza virus a/horse/kentucky/94 or a/horse/newmarket/2/93, protected horses from infection. in addition, antibody titers remained high for at least 1 year following the second vaccination.also coronavirus vectors have been developed as was demonstrated by luis enjuanes (centro nacional de biotecnología, csic, madrid, spain). this single-stranded positive sense rna virus has no dna intermediate, minimizing the risk of chromosomal integration by the vector. in addition, variation of the spike protein can control the tropism of the virus and target certain areas of the body. finally, reinfections with coronaviruses occur frequently, suggesting that pre-existing immunity is easily overcome by the virus. the construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the full-length transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) allowed genetic manipulation of the virus [24]. it was shown that an e-protein deficient tgev virus can only replicate on packaging cell-lines expressing the e-protein [25]. relocation of the packaging signal between the m and e genes (a likely recombination site of e-protein deficient viruses to become propagation competent) is leading to the production of highly safe coronavirus vectors [26].certain attenuated viruses can be used as vectors for antigen delivery of foreign (viral) antigens. attenuation may be achieved by reduced replication capacity (e.g. yf strain 17d and modified vaccinia ankara (mva)) or be based on species restriction (e.g. canarypox vector (alvac)). these vectors can induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses specific for the protein of interest. gerd sutter (gsf—institute of molecular virology, muenchen, germany) elaborated on progress made with regard to the development of mva vector technologies. mva can be used under conditions of biosafety level 1 because of its avirulence and its deficiency to productively grow in human cells. in animal models, mva vaccines have been found immunogenic and protective against various infectious agents including immunodeficiency viruses. here, data from a clinical trial were presented providing evidence for safety and immunogenicity of recombinant mva when used as therapeutic vaccine in hiv-infected individuals [27]. finally, it was shown that modification of immune regulatory genes, such as interferon resistance genes or interleukin-inhibitor sequences conserved within the mva genome, might provide the basis for the development of advanced second generation mva vaccines with even higher immunogenicity [28], [29].another viral vector is semliki-forest virus (sfv), which has features of both the dna and the rna viral vectors. for the induction of an immune response against a foreign antigen, sfv replicons producing the foreign protein can be used for vaccination. also naked rna or cdna of these replicons can be used for vaccination against foreign antigens [30]. peter liljeström (karolinska institute, stockholm, sweden) reported that the replicase protein of sfv plays an important role in the maturation of dendritic cells (dc). it was also shown that sfv is capable of inducing cross-priming and maturation of dc as well as interferon (ifn)-α production, providing enough danger signals to induce a vigorous immune response to foreign antigens, explaining their good immunogenicity.the potential to modulate hcv-specific immune responses using cytokines was tested by christine rollier (biomedical primate research center, rijswijk, netherlands). the addition of dna plasmids encoding for interleukin (il)-12 and il-2 did not enhance the immunogenicity of a candidate dna vaccine based on the ns3 protein of hcv in rhesus macaques.josé melero, using state of the art technology, has identified the fusion properties and fusion sites of rsv fusion protein (f-protein) [31]. future research will be aimed at the development of compounds or antibodies capable of binding to the fusogenic intermediate of the f-protein.ideal vaccines should combine low reactogenicity with high immunogenicity profiles in order to be safe and efficacious. unfortunately both characteristics often go hand in hand resulting in immunogenic but reactogenic vaccines. therefore researchers have tried to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines by prime-boost regimens or by using adjuvants or alternative methods of vaccination.guus rimmelzwaan (erasmus mc, rotterdam, netherlands) summarized the findings of three different studies conducted in three different species using iscoms containing the ha and neuraminidase (na) of various influenza viruses. both monkeys and chickens were protected from infection with the h3n2 subtype and the highly pathogenic h5n1 subtype of influenza a virus respectively after vaccination with an iscom based but not after vaccination with a conventional sub-unit vaccine [32], [33]. the protection correlated with vigorous antibody and t-cell responses. in humans, who have pre-existing immunity to influenza virus, the added value of the adjuvant was less pronounced. however, the kinetics of virus-specific antibody responses was accelerated in the iscom vaccinated individuals compared to those who received the conventional vaccine. in addition, the iscom vaccine induced ctl responses, whereas the classical vaccine did not.vaccines are often administered intramuscularly (im), while alternative administration methods may enhance the immunogenicity of certain vaccines. lendon payne (powderject vaccines inc., wi, usa) demonstrated that the powderject™ can deliver dna and proteins to the epidermis, which is known to contain a unique population of langerhans cells. the epidermal powder immunization can also combine certain adjuvants, like qs21 or e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) with dna or sub-unit vaccines. co-administration of lt induced strong cellular immune responses in mice [34].jan wilschut (university of groningen, groningen, netherlands) presented data on the use of virosomes as a possible carrier of influenza viral glycoproteins. virosomes, which are reconstituted viral envelopes without the viral genome, have been shown to induce both humoral and cellular immunity in mice [35]. in addition, the virosomes are capable of harboring aliphatic adjuvants, further enhancing their potential to induce immunity to viral glycoproteins.finally, anneke boonstra (covaccine bv, lelystad, netherlands) informed us about the latest developments in dissacharide fatty acid sulphate ester adjuvants [36]. experiments demonstrated that one sulphate in combination with seven lauric acids (s1l7 in squalane-in-water) induced high levels of influenza virus-specific antibodies in both pigs and humans.gary nabel (national institute of health, bethesda, usa), presented recent data on human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) candidate vaccine testing. in monkeys, inclusion of the envelop gene in the candidate vaccine (plasmid dna—recombinant adenovirus prime-boost regiment) enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses which correlated with immune protection [37]. using high doses of plasmid dna (4–8 milligram), hiv-specific t-cell responses were induced in a high percentage of individuals. one of the mysteries of hiv is the transmission of ccr5-tropic viruses, and not cxcr4-tropic viruses, upon infection. new data demonstrated that the ccr5-tropic viruses can infect immature dc, whereas cxcr4-tropic viruses cannot. these immature dc can, upon maturation, mediate viral transfer to cd4+ t cells. since this whole process is done within cells, it is highly resistant to neutralizing antibody activity. this mechanism may contribute to preferential transmission of ccr5-tropic viruses and may have implications for future vaccine design.dna-prime adenovirus vector boost vaccine regiments currently seem the best method to induce high cd8+ t-cell responses. pre-existing antibodies to adenovirus however interfere with the efficacy of the vaccine. jaap goudsmit (crucell nv, leiden, netherlands) has identified alternative adenovirus serotypes with low seroprevalence in the human population. adenovirus serotype 35 (ad35) was shown to have low global seroprevalence and low infection rates in both hiv positive and negative individuals, which makes ad35 virus an attractive viral vector [38].duncan steele (who, geneva, switzerland) offered us the latest on rotavirus vaccine developments [39], [40]. rotavirus is an important pathogen of young children claiming half a million deaths each year, in particular in developing countries. rotavirus is a complex triple layered virus with two neutralizing antigens, which are involved in the immune response of the host. vaccine strategies differ in the need for the development of homo- and heterotypic immunity to these specific antigens. currently, two la rotavirus vaccines are licensed. rotashield® (wyeth vaccines), a tetravalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine, demonstrated 70% protection against all rotavirus diarrhea and more than 90% against severe disease. however 25% of the vaccinees developed fever upon vaccination and there was an elevated risk of developing intussusception in 1/10,000 vaccinees. for this reason rotashield® as a vaccine has been withdrawn. the second la rotavirus vaccine is manufactured in china, although it efficacy in truly naïve children remains to be demonstrated.two candidate rotavirus vaccines are in late stages of development, rotateq® (merck, research) and rotarix® (gsk biologicals). the efficacy of both candidate vaccines is similar in early clinical trials (approximately 70% effective in preventing rotavirus diarrhea) to that of rotashield®. the future will reveal which of the two candidate vaccines, i.e. a two dose (rotarix®) or the three dose oral vaccination (rotateq®) will provide better heterologous and long-term protection. prior to clinical use of rotavirus candidate vaccines, potential interference with live oral poliovirus vaccination and the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in hiv-infected children should be investigated.the threats of emerging viral infections and terrorist attacks with biological weapons have triggered a major effort finding cures or vaccines against these agents. james leduc pointed out some of the issues involved in candidate vaccines for emerging and rare diseases. the difficulty with these rare viral diseases is the inability to demonstrate efficacy in humans. should fda approval therefore be based on data obtained in 20–50 monkeys, whose predictive value regarding efficacy and safety remain controversial. other issues involved are; fast tracking of these vaccines by the regulatory authorities, covering international property rights, liability issues, and different viewpoints of government and industry, including willingness and justifiability to develop certain vaccines.gary nabel presented data on ebola virus vaccine development. the glycoprotein (gp) of ebola virus causes cell rounding and detachment of human endothelial and epithelial cells. these effects require the presence of the mucin-like domain of gp and correspond with the down-regulation of vα-integrin on the cell surface. the gp is an important vaccine candidate, however passive transfer of antibodies in both humans and monkeys did not confer protection from infection. vaccination experiments are therefore aiming at the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses to ebola virus. surprisingly, monkeys vaccinated once with an adenoviral vector encoding for the gp and np of ebola virus, were protected from a high dose challenge [41].in 2001, the us government had decided that every citizen should be able to receive a smallpox vaccination. the original dryvax® vaccine consisted of heterogeneous virion subpopulations and may have been contaminated with ruminant viruses. richard weltzin (acambis inc., ma, usa) presented data on the plaque purification of the original virus stock, yielding the acam2000 isolate, which proved to be immunogenic without neurovirulence in mice and monkeys [42]. currently, this virus is being tested in phase i and ii trials.smallpox vaccination by scarification with vaccinia virus is a crude method, which is not quantitative and requires skilled personnel. it also results in an active local lesion and shedding of live virus. other methods of vaccination may be more quantitative and do not shed live virus. amanda phelps (biomedical sciences, porton down, uk) showed that intramuscular vaccination of mice provided better protection at lower vaccine doses than needle-free (microject) or scarification methods.severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is an important emerging infectious disease caused by sars-cov, for which currently no cure or vaccine exists. in mice it was shown that dna encoding the spike protein of sars-cov induced spike protein-specific antibodies. these antibodies and antiserum from a recovered patient were shown by gary nabel to inhibit gene transfer by a pseudotype virus containing the spike protein of sars-cov. in addition, kirill kalnin (acambis inc., ma, usa) demonstrated that hyper immune serum from sars-cov infected individuals reacted with the recombinant spike protein. these data suggest that the spike protein of sars-cov may be a good vaccine candidate.the viral vaccine meeting ended with a series of presentations about the emergence of sars-cov. on february 14th, the who reported the first cases of sars-cov. between the 21st and 26th of march, a new coronavirus, sars-cov, was identified by three laboratories [43], [44]. two weeks later, the entire genome of the virus was sequenced [45], closely followed by the fulfillment of koch’s postulates [46]. other important hallmarks for sars-cov were the identification of the virus in several animal species including the palm civets. albert osterhaus showed the ability of sars-cov to infect macaques [46] and different carnivore species including the house-cat and the ferret [47].at the end of the epidemic several important conclusions could be drawn. among the risk factors for adverse outcome of the disease were age >60 years, diabetes, heart disease and other co-morbid conditions. early during the epidemic it was noted that health-care workers were at risk for contracting disease. this may have been due to the relatively late peak in virus-titers (day 10–16 after onset of illness), subjecting these health care workers with high doses of virus. the relatively late peak in virus titers has also hampered the diagnosis of sars-cov. malik peiris (queens mary hospital, hong kong, sar) showed that improved rna extraction and real-time pcr increase the percentage positive swabs considerably (63% positive on day 1 and 88% on day 2–3) [48].to prepare for a second introduction of sars-cov into the human population, antiviral drugs and protective vaccines are urgently needed. luis enjuanes was the first to clone the full-length genome of a coronavirus (tgev). the deletion of the e protein and relocation of the packaging signal has generated a safe and efficacious vaccine candidate. a full-length sars-cov genomic clone [49], may augment the generation of candidate sars-cov vaccines.the meeting was ended with a presentation by jan hendriks (public health directorate, european commission, luxembourg), who on behalf of the european commission highlighted the opportunities and stumble blocks for the development of viral vaccines of major importance to public health.the meeting not only provided an overview of the viral vaccines that are currently used in humans and animals with varying degrees of success, but also gave a state of the art view of novel developments and opportunities in this field.promoting regulatory convergence is recognized as a key enabler in the world health organization (who) r&d blueprint. regulatory preparedness for public health emergencies (phes) was on the agenda of the 17th international conference of drug regulatory authorities (icdra) meeting in 2016. a number of regulatory gaps were identified and icdra recommended who should ensure that regulatory support is a priority area of activity as the r&d blueprint for emerging infectious diseases is implemented 1 . it was also requested who should continue developing measurement and written standards that serve as a basis for regulatory evaluation taking into consideration: (1) priority pathogens defined by the blueprint, and (2) a more flexible and dynamic approach to developing and establishing standards for quality, safety, and efficacy of products for use in phes 2 .in response to the request, who convened an informal consultation in february 2018 to initiate the work to revise the guidelines for assuring the quality and nonclinical safety evaluation of dna vaccines (annex 1, who technical report series no. 941) adopted by the 2005 ecbs 3 . based on the agreement in the informal consultation in february 2018, the first revised draft was prepared by a drafting group and posted on who biologicals website for the first round of public consultation (https://www. who.int/biologicals/who_dna_vaccine_hk_26_july_2019.pdf). the consultation in december 2019 aimed to discuss and obtain advice on the first draft document and main issues addressed from the public consultation.about 35 experts participated in the consultation, including the regulators from 13 countries in six who regions.dr. heidi meyer (paul-ehrlich-institut, germany) was nominated as chairperson and dr. rebecca sheets (who consultant, usa) as rapporteur for the consultation.dr ivana knezevic (who hq, switzerland) welcomed all the participants to geneva and briefed the participants on the activities of who in the area of biological standardization. she explained that who is the directing and coordinating authority for health on behalf of the 194 member countries in the united nations system. in order to fulfill who objectives, a core who function defined as setting norms and standards, and promoting and monitoring their implementation has been conducted for 70 years. this initiative includes assisting national regulatory authorities (nras) in the utilization of who biological reference materials and application of the principles in who guidelines and recommendations, to ensure quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines, and other biologicals.the world of immunization is a rapidly evolving field, and is constantly changing the picture of morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases. in that context, vaccines are playing a critical role in disease prevention and access to vaccines of assured quality is one of the goals of the who. at the same time, the use of new technologies for manufacturing, as well as new antigens, adjuvants, and routes of administration are imposing lots of challenges not only to regulators, but also to public health professionals. in addition, the response to phes, such as ebola and zika outbreaks triggered development of a number of vaccine candidates based on nucleic acid platforms. clinical trials with 1 independent expert, 20906 silver spring, md, usa. 2 world health organization, 1211 geneva, switzerland. 3 paul-ehrlich-institut, 63225 langen, germany. *a list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper. ✉ email: kangh@who.int these candidates for different diseases are either ongoing or planned in the near future (post meeting note: at the time of the submission of this paper for publication, more than ten vaccine candidates against the coronavirus disease (covid-19), based on nucleic acids, are being developed. who is monitoring vaccines under development continuously and provides regular updates on it (https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/ novel-coronavirus/en/). this is increasing the importance of the revision and update of who guidelines for evaluation of dna vaccines in line with the scientific advances.furthermore, who has other initiatives that are closely linked to the standardization of vaccines. in particular, strengthening of nras is one of the important elements in assuring the quality of vaccines worldwide. prequalification of vaccines by who is an important mechanism through which vaccines become subject of supply by unicef. safety of vaccines and the issues discussed at the who global advisory committee on vaccine safety (gacvs) are also very important, as well as who activities related to immunization policy. in june 2019, the who gacvs set "six initial strategic priorities (which) are: systems and integration; equity and access; fragility and emergencies; values and ownership; research and innovation; and sustainability and accountability" (https:// www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/reports/jun_2019/en/). of importance to the report herein are their priorities on research and innovation and on fragility and emergencies.dr knezevic emphasized the importance of the present consultation that is the last step in terms of the face-to-face consultation on evaluating quality, safety, and efficacy of dna vaccines, involving regulators, manufacturers, and other experts in this field. representatives of several collaborating centers for biological standardization are also part of the consultation, as well as representatives of other institutions that are playing an important role in this field.dr hye-na kang (who hq, switzerland) provided the background to the development of the guidelines and to the organization of this consultation. she reviewed the recommendations from the 17th meeting of icdra 1 and the procedure of drafting guidelines by the who drafting group that consisted of drs. margaret a. liu, heidi meyer, edwin nkansah, keith peden, rebecca sheets, and who secretariat hye-na kang. in response to the request of the icdra, a drafting group prepared the first draft of document and released it for public consultation after a series of teleconferences (https://www.who.int/biologicals/ who_dna_vaccine_hk_26_july_2019.pdf). the objective of the informal consultation (december 2019) was to reach a consensus on the regulatory principles of the draft guidelines, discuss and identify any pending or critical issues such that an improved second draft can be prepared for the final round of public consultation, and adoption by the who ecbs in october 2020.several researchers in the field of plasmid dna vaccines presented data on the current status of their development. there continues to be great interest by international groups on the promise of plasmid dna vaccines as a platform technology for the rapid and facile development of vaccines to prevent outbreaks and pandemics. dr. david kaslow (path, usa) representing the who product development for vaccines advisory committee (pdvac) reviewed the advantages of dna vaccines as a platform technology and how they fit into the objectives and goals of the pdvac. he pointed out that the guideline revision may need to reflect the potential different purposes of a dna vaccine-i.e., the use for routine immunization vs. the use for an outbreak setting. it will be important that dna vaccines become available for the purposes of routine immunization if they are to be truly available in the case of outbreak response. he also raised some potential issues surrounding the need for a specific device for vaccine delivery, especially in the outbreak setting, when the supply may be limited and the cost-of-goods may not be favorable. in preparation for such situations, current device designs should be adapted for ease of use, and deployment in the setting of low-and middle-income countries (lmics), as well as meet who programmatic suitability criteria for routine use. dr. kaslow also raised the issue of the need for more information on developmental toxicology for dna vaccines to support their use in the setting of maternal immunization, including in breast-feeding women. these data are needed to pave the way for outbreak responses as pregnant women often belong to the group at highest risk for serious complications.dr. nick jackson (coalition for epidemic preparedness and innovation (cepi), norway) explained the role of the cepi and their interest in plasmid dna vaccines as a platform technology to achieve their mission. they target certain pathogens in their funding program, including lassa virus, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), nipah virus, rift valley fever virus, chikungunya virus, and "disease 'x'" (a hypothetical template for an emerging disease of the future). a mers-cov plasmid dna vaccine candidate has advanced into phase 1 clinical trials with promising results. they plan to initiate a phase 2 study in mid-2020. a lassa virus candidate vaccine has also advanced into a phase 1 clinical trial.dr. ami patel (the wistar institute, usa) discussed many advantages of plasmid dna vaccines and gave an update on a therapeutic human papilloma virus vaccine candidate delivered in conjunction with an electroporation device. this vaccine candidate has also completed phase 2b pilot efficacy testing against cervical cancer, with very interesting results of 40-45% impact on endpoints, such as regression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) 2/3 to cin 1, regression to normal, and clearance of evidence of infection 4 . a phase 3 study of this candidate opened in 2017. this candidate is also being studied in head and neck cancer 5 . her team is also involved in development of ebola, mers-cov, and zika plasmid dna vaccine candidates. in the case of zika, her team was able to advance to the clinic with the candidate plasmid dna vaccine rapidly (7 months) largely because of not needing to repeat nonclinical toxicology studies on their platform technology 6 . instead, decisions were made on the basis of existing nonclinical and clinical data for the platform, which predict safe starting doses and dose regimens, as well as expected reactogenicity for the platform. finally, she presented her work on expressing monoclonal antibodies (mab) in the plasmid dna system. their anti-zika candidate mab has advanced to the clinic, as well.an update was given by dr. julie ledgerwood (nih, usa) on a plasmid dna vaccine candidate that had proceeded as far as an international phase 2b (pilot efficacy) study against zika virus. while safety was demonstrated, the changing epidemiology in the face of a waning epidemic meant that too few cases of zika were seen to evaluate efficacy; however, samples are still being analyzed and further cases may yet be identified. importantly, because of their platform and earlier nonclinical and clinical work on a west nile virus plasmid dna vaccine candidate, their zika vaccine candidate was able to proceed to phase 1 in 3.25 months, in large measure because additional nonclinical toxicology studies were not required, abbreviating not only the nonclinical program, but the overall time-to-clinic. as with dr. patel's team's vaccine candidate, decisions were based on the existing database of nonclinical and clinical experience with the platform. early entry into phase 1 permitted advancement to phase 2b even as the outbreak was ongoing. unfortunately, this was still not rapid enough to capture sufficient efficacy data to support near-term licensure of the vaccine candidate 7 . she also presented data on studies performed earlier by her institute, in which plasmid dna vaccine candidates for ebola and marburg were among the first plasmid dna vaccines tested in africa, demonstrating feasibility of testing these vaccines delivered by devices other than needleand-syringe in lmic settings 8 .plasmid dna vaccines may be viewed as a platform technology in which only the antigen gene has been changed from one vaccine to another based on the same dna plasmid backbone. for a given manufacturer, the manufacturing and controls may vary little between plasmid dna vaccines they manufacture. control measures are likely highly similar even between manufacturers. therefore, the guidelines on plasmid dna vaccines, though not specific to a particular vaccine, can be written so as to be generally applicable with part a, the quality section of the guidelines. in addition, although part b, nonclinical and part c, clinical sections will be consistent with the general guidelines on these topics, there are a few additional topic areas of relevance to plasmid dna vaccines discussed in these guidelines [9] [10] [11] .many of the concerns that harken back to the beginnings of use of plasmid dna vaccines, two decades ago, have been deleted from the guidelines as nonclinical and clinical evidence from various vaccine candidates over the intervening time have alleviated those concerns. the current generation of dna vaccines made from bacteria are produced biologically and are considered to be a biological product. while the plasmid is generated by recombinant dna technology, it should be clarified that a plasmid dna vaccine itself is not an organism; thus, it is not a genetically modified organism per se, nor is it a gene-transfer or gene-therapy product, as it is not expected to persist and permanently "mark" the recipient. there is a wealth of evidence that dna vaccines to date do not persist or even biodistribute throughout the body of table 1 . the summary of major proposed changes in the revision of the draft guidelines for assuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of plasmid dna vaccines.proposed changes title of the document add "plasmid" to the title. likewise, it was agreed to refer to dna vaccines as plasmid dna vaccines rather than dna plasmid vaccines.provide the definitions of adjuvant and candidate vaccine to align with the relevant who guidelines.plasmid dna expressing prophylactic monoclonal antibodies were outside of scope, but that like some immunotherapeutics based on plasmid dna, that the quality (part a) section may have applicability to this product class, though parts b (nonclinical) and c (clinical) are unlikely to apply.introduction add a few more of the advantages of plasmid dna vaccines.part a, manufacturing and control • definition: the international non-proprietary names conventions would apply to dna vaccines.• general manufacturing guidelines: to clarify some language around potential for carryover or cross-contamination in multiuse facilities. • source, history, and generation of the host cell and plasmid: to discuss the potential use of novel strains or species of bacteria, and to reflect more currently the means of assessing and ensuring genetic stability of the plasmid dna construct. • characterization of the bulk purified plasmid: clarification on characterizing the mode-or mechanism-of-action of the vaccine, including immunomodulatory elements. • consistency of manufacturing: clarification to reflect that this part is not referring to clinical studies, but to timing of manufacturing assessments of consistency. • manufacture and control of the final formulated vaccine: a subsection needed to be added to discuss measuring strength, dose, or content of the vaccine. • potency: to change some language, as mentioned above, to reflect that potency might be measured by content and percentage supercoiling rather than use of a bioassay. further clarity was given to measuring the expression by mrna rather than protein production. • safety, including sterility and endotoxin testing: to update to reference the monocyte activation test and to include the 3rs concept.part b, nonclinical evaluation • this section was considered to be generally satisfactory, though the need for more references that support the abbreviation of nonclinical programs would be useful to include for regulators in countries that have limited experience with this product type to date. several references in this regard will be added. • furthermore, some changes in part c made it apparent that further discussion was needed in part b on the subject of the existing database of biodistribution data showing limited distribution and rapid degradation outside the injection site, which assuage historical concerns about germ-line involvement or genetic transfer. likewise, a need to acknowledge the current evidence gap in developmental toxicology for dna vaccines was raised.part c, clinical evaluation • it was agreed that this section required some additions and modifications.• some language about the device/vaccine co-development should be included. the topics needed to be added included post-marketing surveillance issues, choice of control group (with or without use of device), and protocol/labeling language. • further, an issue that seemed to have some potential to complicate or confuse safety evaluations was the timing of adverse events, following boost doses in heterologous prime-boost regimens and whether to attribute them to the prime or the boost.part d, guidelines for national regulatory authorities• language in part d, two official release and certification needs to be further examined since it is likely that licensing of a new plasmid dna vaccine will be reflected in a product/disease-specific who guideline at the time of such. therefore, it might not be accurate to say the vaccine lot would only be released if it fulfilled the part a, quality section of this broad dna vaccine guideline. • two appendices related to part d may need to be added to the guidelines.-model summary protocol for the manufacturing and control of dna vaccines.-model national regulatory authority lot release certificate for dna vaccines.the vaccine when delivered parenterally into muscle, subcutaneous tissue, or various dermal layers. in addition, development of plasmid dna vaccines for routine use may lead to rapid and ready implementation of new vaccines for emerging diseases even in the face of an emergency setting. once the platform technology is proven safe and efficacious for one or more diseases, a novel vaccine candidate based on the same technology but replacing only the antigen encoded to match the emerging disease could permit rapid manufacturing, reduced (abbreviated) or waived requirements for nonclinical toxicology, and rapid entry into clinical testing. rapid entry into the clinic has already been shown with two plasmid dna vaccine candidates against zika described above. thus, proof-of-concept has precedent.this session was dedicated to reviewing the draft guidelines in response to the public consultation. the discussion was led by dr. rebecca sheets providing a summary of comments received from the first round of public consultation and main issues to be discussed at this meeting. most of these comments were accepted and the changes made. rejected comments were few, such as a suggestion to follow the ich structure rather than the who standard. however, three topics remained for discussion by the consultants at the meeting. the first of these was surrounding several comments received on the discussion of potency assessment of multi-plasmid-containing vaccines. the second topic was about the appendix on heterologous prime-boost included in the current draft document. several comments were made to delete the appendix as the information was included in the body of the guideline. the third topic was on a comment given to put more emphasis on the delivery device discussion.the discussion on potency of multi-plasmid-containing vaccines led to a decision to clarify the discussion in the guideline for the rationale why this might need to be done at the individual bulk stage instead of in the final product. however, this discussion led to a more important and in-depth look at how potency is being assessed currently. most vaccine candidates are moving forward into the clinical development without a bioassay, but simply measuring content (quantity-the basis for dosing) and percent supercoiled form of plasmid (a quality measure that should correlate with potency in vivo). this led to the discussion of revisions to the potency section itself. the appendix on heterologous prime-boost was agreed to be deleted. the discussion on the delivery device led to agreement that the information already in the general principles was mostly adequate, but that further emphasis on the labeling of what some jurisdictions might consider to be a combination product. it was also agreed that further discussion about the device in part c (clinical) would add further clarity to the guidelines.during the consultation, several suggestions for amendment of the current draft document were made in order to reaffirm, clarify, and provide further guidance on specific issues. these are summarized in table 1 .• the development of guidelines was welcomed and applauded by stakeholders.• participants agreed that the guidelines incorporate sound scientific evaluation principles consistent with international initiatives and would promote regulatory convergence.• it might be necessary for who to assist nras in implementing the principles of the guidelines into their regulatory practices.• due to rapid technological advances in dna vaccine development, it was proposed that there should be more frequent updating of these guidelines.• who support to develop guidelines on regulatory evaluation of vaccines for phe uses, as well as of combination products was requested.• it was agreed that the guidelines be revised based on the comments received. following revision and another round of public consultation, the document will be discussed at the meeting of who ecbs in october 2020 for adoption.• a need for facilitating implementation of updated who guidelines for evaluation of dna vaccines was identified as an activity that would help nras in who members states to establish and/or update national guidance for dna vaccines.the consultation also recognized that development of rnabased vaccines requires who action. it was proposed to consider preparation of a state of the art paper on the evaluation of rna-based vaccines ( table 1 ). it was clear that the scientific evidence for these vaccines is limited and more data will most likely become available in coming years (table 1) . nevertheless, the importance of who leadership in this area was identified as one of the follow-up actions beyond the revision of who guidelines for evaluation of dna vaccines (table 1) .reporting summary further information on research design is available in the nature research reporting summary linked to this article.in late december 2019, a pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in wuhan city, 27 hubei province, china. patients presenting with acute respiratory failure were seen in 28 the er and then admitted to icu facilities for further treatment [1] . the causative . although the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 is lower than that of 50 mers-cov and sars-cov, its transmissibility (median r 0 : 5.7) is much higher than 51 that of either mers-cov (r 0 : <1) or sars-cov (r 0 : 3) [ up to now, sars-cov-2 has been detected from clinical specimens analyzed by under development by several organizations through international collaborations [32] .the pulmonary surfactant-biomimetic nanoparticles used to potentiate heterosubtypic 152 influenza immunity can be used as adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of 153 sars-cov-2 subunit vaccines [33] . roxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or).another interesting strategy is to use convalescent plasma (cp) as treatment, but it 238 should be noted that cp should be collected within two weeks after recovery to ensure 239 a high neutralization antibody titer [50] . it was reported that sars-cov-2 isolated the experimental vaccines do not fully reproduce the clinical signs observed in the natural host. in addition, with few exceptions, the evaluation of these vaccines has been made in young animals, and it has been shown that the outcome of challenge experiments, although positive in young animals, frequently showed side effects when performed in old mice [20, 21] . recently, animal models have been considerably improved, reproducing most of the pathology observed in humans [22, 23] . in particular, a mouse-adapted sars-cov model, selected after fifteen passages in mice (sars-cov-ma15), reproduces most clinical signs observed in human infections during the sars epidemic in 2003, including death of infected mice. this animal model is considered the best available. therefore, vaccine candidates developed so far may have to be reevaluated in this model using young and aged mice.vaccines based on whole purified inactivated virus have the benefit of presenting a complete repertoire of viral antigens, although inactivated vaccines do not in general provide longlasting immunity. these vaccines provide good protection in mice [24] , hamster [25] , and partial protection in ferrets [25, 26] .in rhesus monkeys, a formaldehyde-inactivated sars-cov vaccine showed partial protection [27, 28] . an inactivated sars-cov vaccine was also administered to humans. this vaccine was safe and induced neutralizing antibodies, but no efficacy data have been reported [29] . overall, inactivated vaccines, based on whole purified virus, induced neutralizing antibodies, were apparently safe at least in young animal models and provided good protection.subunit vaccines have the advantage of their simplicity, chemical definition, and lack of potential variability [30] . in the case of sars-cov, a great advantage is that well-defined s protein domains binding the cell receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme (hace2) have provided full immune protection [31] [32] [33] [34] . this concept is reinforced by the observation that monoclonal antibodies specific for the receptor binding domain elicited protection in several animal models, including african green monkeys [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .in addition to s protein-derived domains or peptides, protein 3a, a large protein of sars-cov exposed on its envelope, also elicits virus neutralizing antibodies [42] and could be useful in improving subunit vaccines. furthermore, immunity to sars-cov has also been demonstrated with virus-like particles (vlp) [43] . overall, the results obtained with subunit vaccines strongly suggest that protection against sars by vaccination is feasible.dna vaccines are safe and nonexpensive but, often, are not very efficient in large mammals. dna vaccines induce sars-cov neutralizing antibodies and protection in mice [44] [45] [46] [47] .the use of viral vectors to protect against sars has been extensively explored. adenovirus induced good protection in mice [25] . modified vaccinia ankara (mva) provides protection in mice [35] and ferrets [48] although induction of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (aded) was reported. adeno-associated virus induces long-term protection against sars-cov [34] . parainfluenza virus elicits protection in hamsters and monkeys [49, 50] . recombinant measles viruses expressing the s protein of sars-cov induces neutralizing antibodies and immune responses against sars-cov [51] . newcastle disease recombinant virus expressing the s protein of sars-cov induces neutralizing antibodies in african green monkeys immunized via the respiratory tract [52] . a recombinant attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) protects mice against sars-cov challenge 4 months after vaccination [53, 54] . venezuelan equine encephalitis (vee) virus expressing the s protein of sars-cov induces protection against challenge with virulent virus in the mouse model [20] . overall, these results indicate that there is a very good prospect for the development of an efficacious and safe vaccine to prevent sars. nevertheless, there are relevant aspects that need to be improved in order to achieve a vaccine that can be fully protective and free of side effects both in young and in elderly people.sars-cov is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense rna virus with a genome of 29.7 kb that belongs to genus b of the coronaviridae [55-57] (fig. 1a) . the replicase gene is encoded within the 5 0 two-thirds of the sars-cov genome, including two overlapping open reading frames (orf) named orfs 1a and 1b. the latter is translated by a ribosomal frameshift upstream of the orf 1a stop codon [58, 59] (fig. 1b) . translation of both orfs in the cytoplasm of infected cells results in the synthesis of two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are processed by two viral proteinases to yield 16 functional nonstructural proteins (nsps) [60, 61] . these nsps are the components of the membrane-anchored replicationtranscription complex [62] . all covs encode species-specific accessory genes in their downstream orfs, with a remarkably conserved order: replicase/transcriptase, spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n). the lipid bilayer envelope contains at least three proteins: e and m that coordinate virion assembly and release, and the large peplomer s (fig 1a) . this glycoprotein is located on the virion surface, conferring the virus characteristic corona shape. s is the main mediator of host cell attachment and entry. sars-cov orfs 3a, 6, 7a, and 7b encode additional virus membrane proteins [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . other accessory proteins are 8a, 8b and 9b. the functions for most of the accessory proteins are still unclear; however, it is known that some of these proteins influence virus-host interaction and viral pathogenesis [68] [69] [70] .for sars-cov, hace2 molecule serves as a receptor [71] ; cd209l has also been implicated as an alternative receptor in entry [72] .live attenuated viruses have generally proven to be the most effective vaccines against viral infections. the production of effective and safe live attenuated vaccines for animal covs has not been satisfactory, largely because vaccine strains are insufficiently immunogenic and, in addition, may recombine, resulting in novel viruses with increased virulence [73] [74] [75] . several groups, including ours, have described modifications to the sars-cov that are attenuating. these "domesticated" viruses may be useful platforms to develop inactivated or live vaccines. in general, for rna viruses, it is essential to develop a reverse genetic system to develop a virus with an attenuated phenotype. this is certainly the case for coronaviruses that have the largest genome known (around 30 kb) for an rna virus, increasing the technical difficulty of generating an infectious cdna. we have developed efficient transmissible gastroenteritis cov (tgev) and sars-cov reverse genetics systems, by inserting infectious cdna clones of these viruses into bacterial artificial chromosomes (bacs) [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] (fig. 2a ). in this system, the genomic rna is expressed in the cell nucleus under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (first amplification by the cellular polymerase ii), with subsequent amplification in the cytoplasm by the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase. this reverse genetics system is highly efficient because it implies two amplification steps. in addition, cdna stability in the bac is very high. soon after the bac technology was applied to assemble an infectious coronavirus cdna clone, alternative strategies were developed, including (1) a system to assemble a full-length cdna construct of the tgev genome by using adjoining cdna subclones that have unique, flanking, interconnecting junctions [81] . transcripts derived from the tgev cdna assembled using this approach can be used to derive infectious recombinant virus; (2) a system in which the cloning vector is a poxvirus. using the genome of this poxvirus including the genome cdna copy as a template, the viral genome is transcribed in vitro, and infectious virus is recovered from transfected cells [82] ; (3) a modified procedure was described in which the coronavirus genomic rna is transcribed inside cells using a poxvirus genome as a template. to this end, the viral genome is cloned under the control of t7 promoter, and the poxvirus dna including the infectious cdna is transfected into cells that are infected with a poxvirus expressing t7 polymerase [83] . the generated transcript reconstitutes an infectious cov.in the case of sars-cov, several genes have been deleted in order to generate viruses with attenuated phenotypes. nevertheless, deletion of one or more accessory genes did not significantly attenuate sars-cov [88] . fortunately, we showed that deletion of the e gene, encoding the envelope protein, led to a viable sars-cov, indicating that e protein is not essential for virus replication. interestingly, viruses table with the genes deleted in three sars-cov recombinant viruses. deletion mutants without e gene led to viruses with attenuated phenotypes lacking e protein are attenuated, grow in the lung, and are immunogenic in different animal models [79, [85] [86] [87] .modification or deletion of other sars-cov genes has also been considered in the design of vaccines to prevent sars. some of these genes (nsp1, nsp14, s, and n) are essential for virus replication, while others (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9b) are nonessential for virus growth in cell culture or in vivo. the design of sars vaccines based on deletion of sars-cov genes is described below. nevertheless, most attention is given to the deletion or modification of e, nsp1, nsp2, and 3a genes.sars-cov deletion mutants lacking each of orfs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, or 7b did not significantly influence in vitro and in vivo replication efficiency in the mouse model [88, 89] . all recombinant viruses replicated to similar wild-type levels, suggesting that either the group-specific orfs play a limited role in in vivo replication efficiency or that the mouse model used in the evaluation does not meet the requirements to discriminate the activity of group-specific orfs in disease [88] . in fact, it was unexpected that the deletion of orfs such as 3a, 7a, and 7b which encode structural proteins [64, 67, 88, 90, 91] would show little influence on virus replication in the mouse model. only deletion of orf 3a showed a minor decrease (below tenfold) in virus growth. furthermore, deletion of combinations of genes, such as deletion of orfs 3a and 3b, and orf6, showed a 10-30-fold titer reduction in vero cells, but showed a limited effect on virus growth in the murine model at day 2 postinfection. moreover, the simultaneous deletion of larger combinations of group-specific genes such as 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b has led to the production of an infectious sars-cov deletion mutant that propagated in cell culture with a titer similar to that of the parental wild-type virus and was not attenuated in transgenic mice that expressed the sars-cov receptor (hace2) [85] . therefore, the effect of sars-cov gene deletions needs to be tested in more relevant animal models.interestingly, the deletion of the e gene alone, or in combination with the removal of genes 6-9b, led to mutant viruses that seem to be promising vaccine candidates [79, [85] [86] [87] , and is described next.the e gene was nonessential for the genus b mhv cov [92] , although elimination of this gene from the mhv genome reduced virus growth in cell culture more than 1,000-fold. in contrast, for the group 1 tgev coronavirus, expression of the e gene product was essential for virus release and spread. propagation of e gene-deleted tgev (tgev-de) was restored by providing e protein in trans [93, 94] . a recombinant sars-cov (rsars-cov) that lacks the e gene, generated from a bac (fig. 2b) , was recovered in vero e6 cells with a relatively high titer (around 10 6 pfu/ml) and also from huh-7 and caco-2 cells with low titers, indicating that sars-cov e protein is not essential for virus replication in cell culture [79] . electron microscopy observation of vero e6 cells infected with the sars-cov wt or the de deletion mutant showed a higher efficiency of assembly and release for the wt virus (fig. 3) . in this respect, sars-cov-de behaves like mhv, although sars-cov-de grows to a considerably higher titer. vaccine viability and efficacy require the production of viruses with high titers. interestingly, adaptation of the rsars-cov-de virus to grow in vero cells after 16 passages led to an increase of virus titers reaching values almost identical to those displayed by the full-length virus (around 10 7 pfu/ml) [87] . this titer is close to those required for a competitive live attenuated vaccine.while sars-cov infects and replicates in several species, including mice, ferrets, hamsters, and nonhuman primates, most of these animals only develop inapparent or mild disease [95] . an ideal animal model that completely reproduces human in cells infected with the wt virus, 5% of the virions in the final budding step were found bound to the cell, whereas in the e protein-deleted viruses, this number was increased to 16%, suggesting that absence of e protein led to a delay in the "pinch-off step" clinical disease and pathological findings has not been identified. to evaluate the rsars-cov-de vaccine candidate, we have used three animal model systems: hamster, transgenic mice expressing the hace2 receptor for human sars-cov, and conventional mice challenged with the mouse-adapted virus [22, 23, 79, [85] [86] [87] [96] [97] [98] . these animal model systems are complementary.the hamster model has been used to study sars-cov-de virus pathogenicity, because it demonstrates elements present in human cases of sars-cov infections including interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation [79, 96, 97] . the hamster model reproducibly supports sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract to a higher titer and for a longer duration than in mice or nonhuman primates. virus replication in this model is accompanied by histological evidence of pneumonitis, and the animals develop viremia and extrapulmonary spread of virus [96] . although overt clinical disease is absent, the hamster model is a useful model for the evaluation of sars-cov infection. titers of recombinant sars-cov (rsars-cov) achieved in the respiratory tract of hamsters were similar to those previously reported for the wild-type virus [96] and were at least 100-fold higher than titers of the rsars-cov-de virus, suggesting that this mutant virus is attenuated. histopathological examination of lungs from infected hamsters showed reduced amounts of viral antigen and pulmonary inflammation in rsars-cov-de infected than in rsars-cov infected animals, indicating that rsars-cov-de is attenuated in vivo [79] . in fact, reduction of sars-cov titers in patients has been associated with a considerable reduction in pathogenicity and increase in survival rates [99, 100] . rsars-cov-de immunized hamsters remained active following wild-type virus challenge while mock immunized displayed decreased activity [86] .the transgenic mice model is based on the production of mice expressing the hace2, the receptor for human sars-cov. transgenic mice models have been obtained in different laboratories by expressing the hace2 under the control of different promoters [98, 101] . these mice develop moderate respiratory disease, but overwhelming neurological disease with 100% mortality after intranasal infection with sars-cov. as such, they are very useful to assess attenuation and vaccine safety and efficacy. we previously showed that infection of these highly susceptible mice with rsars-cov-de, or rsars-cov with e and several group-specific protein genes 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b deleted (rsars-cov-[de,6-9b]) resulted in neither weight loss nor death, even after inoculation with very high virus doses [85] .the mouse-adapted sars-cov model used in the evaluation of the rsars-cov-de and rsars-cov-d[e,6-9b] was based on the recent isolation of a sars-cov adapted to growth in mice or rats [22, 102, 103] . this model provided a useful system for vaccine evaluation because some strains of mice and rats infected with these viruses develop severe respiratory disease and even death. a mouse-adapted strain was isolated after 15 passages through the lungs of balb/c mice (ma15 strain) and, unlike the parental urbani strain of virus, intranasal inoculation with this virus results in signs of respiratory disease with substantial mortality [22] . we showed that immunization with rsars-cov-de or sars-cov-d[e,6-9b] almost completely protected balb/c mice from fatal respiratory disease caused by mouse-adapted sars-cov (fig. 4) , and partly protected hace2 transgenic mice from lethal disease [87] .in summary, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of rsars-cov-de has been shown in the three animal model systems described above, hamsters, highly susceptible transgenic mice expressing the hace2 receptor for human sars-cov and conventional mice challenged with the ma15 virus. interestingly, both homologous and heterologous protection was observed. in fact, hamsters and hace2 transgenic mice immunized with rsars-cov-de developed high serum neutralizing antibody titers and were protected from replication of homologous (sars-cov urbani) and heterologous sars-cov (gd03) in the upper and lower respiratory tract [86, 87] . the relevance of this observation is that the gd03 strain of sars-cov is one of the serologically most divergent human sars-cov identified, in relation to the urbani strain. in addition, it has been shown that the gd03 strain is closely related to the isolates obtained from animals and if sars-cov were to reemerge, it would probably have an animal origin. despite being attenuated in replication in the respiratory tract, rsars-cov-de virus is an immunogenic and efficacious vaccine in hamsters and two mouse models. virulence was performed with hamsters using the activity wheel, and no decrease of hamster activity was detected 7 days after hamster infection with the sars-covs lacking the e gene, in contrast to those infected with a virus with full-length genome. furthermore, rsars-cov-de did not infect the brain of infected transgenic mice, in contrast to the wt virus. overall, these data indicate that e is a virulence gene [79, 85] . the potential mechanism of e gene product in virulence has been investigated in our laboratory. we have shown that the expression of e gene drastically reduced the expression of genes involved in stress and unfolded protein responses [104] . a reduction in stress responses has been associated with a decrease in the innate and specific immune responses [105] [106] [107] [108] . as a consequence, we have postulated that deletion of the e gene leads to an increased immune response to the virus, reducing its apparent pathogenicity.three complementary strategies are being applied to improve the rsars-cov-de vaccine:to generate an efficient inactivated or live modified vaccine, virus titers need to be high in order to obtain an economically competitive vaccine. to increase virus titers, we propose a novel approach based on previous findings showing that coronavirus genomes encoding a mutated nsp14 3 0 -5 0 -exonuclease (exon) display a mutator phenotype [109] . the engineered sars-cov with a mutated or deleted e protein will be modified to include an exon that causes the accumulation of mutations throughout the viral genome. the mutated viruses will be passed in cell culture by infecting cells with the highest virus dilution possible. these dilutions should contain only those mutant viruses with the highest titer. therefore, we expect that serial passages of these dilutions will select virus clones with high titers. once the desired virus titers have been achieved, it will be confirmed that the high titer viruses are still attenuated in vivo. virus evolution will be reverted to standard levels by replacing the mutator nsp14 by the native one using the infectious cdna clone [110] . selected viruses will be tested for protection as previously described.we have previously shown that rsars-cov-de elicited protective immune responses [86, 87] . at the same time, we and others have also shown that it was possible to delete additional nonessential genes to generate viable sars-cov [85, 88] . some of the additionally deleted genes are involved in the inhibition of ifn activation [68, 111] . we propose to delete some of these genes and determine whether removal of any of them increases the immune response to the vaccine candidate.sars-cov e protein reduced stress, unfolded protein, and immune responses to the virus. we have postulated that efforts to enhance assembly (and levels of viral protein) without diminishing the stress response, which is increased in the absence of e, might increase immunogenicity without compromising safety. as a consequence, we propose the construction of rsars-cov mutants with modified e protein (e*) eliciting higher immune responses to the virus than rsars-cov-de. in these mutants, an e* coding gene fully functional in virus morphogenesis is inserted within the viral genome. the approach is based on the previous identification of host proteins binding sars-cov e protein, influencing virus-induced stress response and the immune response to the virus. e protein ligands were identified by co-immune precipitation and mass spectrometry studies, as we have previously reported [112] , and by yeast two-hybrid technologies [113] . the effect of these proteins on the stress and immune response has been identified. we propose to modify specific e protein domains, in order to prevent virus-host cell interactions that counteract the induction of a strong immune response by rsars-cov vaccines.we will focus on the modification of three sars-cov proteins, as previous findings on these proteins indicate that they are not fully essential for virus viability, and that their modification may lead to attenuated viruses.most of the experimental information on the influence of coronavirus replicase protein modification in attenuation has been obtained changing nsp1 and nsp2 [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] . in the case of sars-cov, it has been shown that nsp1 significantly inhibited ifn-dependent signaling by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of stat1 while having little effect on those of stat2, jak1, and tyk2 [115] . a modification of sars-cov nsp1 (mutations r124s and k125e) resulted in a virus that replicated as efficiently as wild-type virus in cells with a defective ifn response, while its replication was strongly attenuated in cells with an intact ifn response [115] . thus, it is likely that nsp1 mutants will lose virulence and have a reduced pathogenicity. alternatively, mutations or deletions in the nsp1 gene could be introduced, similar to those described in the mhv replicase [114, 116] that led to an attenuated cov phenotype. these types of mutants could be investigated for their relevance in the generation of attenuated sars-cov phenotypes that could be tested for vaccine candidates.deletion of nsp2 in mhv and sars-cov viruses caused 0.5-1 log10 reductions in peak titers in single-cycle growth assays, as well as a reduction in viral rna synthesis and growth [117, 119] . these findings indicate that nsp2 is not essential for virus replication and that its deletion may lead to viruses with an attenuated phenotype. in addition, recent studies with mhv and hcov-229e suggest that this protein may have functions in pathogenesis [117, 120] . therefore, nsp2 seems a promising candidate to complement the safety of a rsars-cov-de vaccine.this o-glycosylated accessory protein of 274 amino acids forms a k + -permeable channel-like structure [91] . it is not essential for growth in tissue culture cells, but deletion of the 3a gene leads to a small (5-10-fold reduction) virus titer reduction both in vitro and in vivo [88] . protein 3a may also be involved in triggering high levels of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production [121] [122] [123] , and its deletion may reduce sars-cov virulence. gene 3a maps at a distal position from genes nsp1 or nsp2. therefore, a recombination event that restores the wild phenotype for gene 3a and genes nsp1 or nsp2 in one event seems very unlikely.coronavirus transcription is regulated by highly conserved sequences preceding each gene. these transcriptional regulatory sequences (trss) are almost identical to sequences located at the 5 0 end of the genome, just downstream of the leader sequence. the trs preceding each gene encodes a complementary sequence in the newly synthesized rna of negative polarity. these rnas have to hybridize with the trs located next to the leader in the process of discontinuous rna synthesis, typical of covs. an alternative approach for developing safer, recombinationresistant live coronavirus vaccines has been developed by baric's group [84] . the novel procedure involves the modification of the trss in a sars-cov vaccine strain, to a sequence incompatible with the trs of any known circulating covs. it was postulated that recombinant events between wt coronaviruses and trs remodeled sars-cov would result in genomes containing incompatible mixed regulatory sequences that block expression of subgenomic mrnas. using a molecular clone, the sars-cov trs network was remodeled from acgaac to ccggat [84] . this rewiring of the genomic transcription network allows efficient replication of the mutant virus, icsars-crg. the icsars-crg recombinant virus replicated to titers equivalent to wt virus and expressed the typical ratios of subgenomic mrnas and proteins. it has been shown that this vaccine candidate provides protection against challenge with virulent sars-cov.previous studies using animal covs have provided experimental evidence for humoral [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] and t cell-mediated responses to animal coronaviruses that exacerbate disease [134] , as previously summarized [17] . this safety concern was increased in the case of sars-cov by two studies. in one report [135] , antibodies that neutralized most human sars-covs also enhanced virus entry mediated by two civet cat sars-covs. these viruses had s glycoproteins related to the sars-cov gd03 isolate. in a second report, it has been shown that the administration of mva-based sars-cov s vaccine into ferrets, but not mva alone, followed by live sars-cov challenge, resulted in enhanced hepatitis [136] . nevertheless, these side effects have not been described in other studies with sars-cov in mice, hamster, ferrets, and african green monkeys [24, 35, 36, 44, 96, [137] [138] [139] [140] .in general, immunization with vaccine candidates has resulted in the absence of side effects. nevertheless, there are still three concerns that remain unaddressed.one is that specific viral proteins, such as sars-cov n expressed by a venezuelan equine encephalitis (vee) virus vector has resulted in enhanced immunopathology following viral challenge [20] , similar to the immune pathology observed following vaccination with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) [141] [142] [143] . a second main concern is the observation that sars-cov vaccines that provide protection in the absence of side effects in young mice show immunopathological complications in aged mice [20] . a third consideration is that most vaccine candidates have been tested in animal models that do not fully reproduce the clinical symptoms observed in humans, and, with one exception, no phase i clinical trials in humans have been performed. therefore, sars vaccine candidates would require additional rigorous clinical and immunological evaluation, using the sars-cov mouse-adapted virus model, and potential side effect assessment both in young and in aged animals.live virus vaccine formulations should include rational approaches to minimize the potential reversion to the wt phenotype and simultaneously resist recombination repair. in principle, a combination of sars-cov genome modifications could lead to viruses with an attenuated phenotype that could be considered safe and effective vaccine candidates. while rsars-cov-de or the selected rsars-cov-e* will be attenuated, in principle, reversion to the virulent phenotype could take place by the reintroduction of the e gene into the virus, by recombination with a closely related coronavirus present in the environment. furthermore, it cannot be excluded that compensatory mutations increasing virus fitness could cause reversion to the virulent phenotype. to minimize these possibilities, additional modifications have to be introduced into the final vaccine candidate, including the modifications of orfs encoding proteins nsp1, nsp2, or 3a, described above. the advantage of combining deletions or mutations in the e protein with those in nsp1 or nsp2 orfs reside in that these genes map into distal positions of the genome (more than 20 kb 5 0 separation), making it very unlikely that a single recombination event could restore the wt virus phenotype. in addition, other creative reorganizations of the virus genome have been described that could increase sars-cov safety (described below).covs have a characteristic, strictly conserved genome organization with genes occurring in the order 5 0 -pol-s-e-m-n-3 0 . mhv virus mutants with the genes encoding the structural proteins located in a different order were constructed, and it was shown that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for in vivo replication [144] . some of the mutants showed an attenuated phenotype. interestingly, rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of cov with reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses. in fact, potential recombination between viruses with different gene orders most likely will lead to nonviable viruses lacking essential genes.as a result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, all but two amino acids in the protein coding sequence can be encoded by more than one synonymous codon. the frequencies of synonymous codon used for each amino acid are unequal and have coevolved with the cell's translation machinery to avoid excessive use of suboptimal codons, which often correspond to rare or otherwise disadvantaged trnas [145, 146] . this results in a phenomenon termed "synonymous codon bias" which varies greatly between evolutionarily distant species [147] . while codon optimization by recombinant methods has been widely used to improve cross-species expression, the opposite direction of reducing expression by intentional introduction of suboptimal synonymous codons has seldom been chosen [146] .de novo gene synthesis with the aim of designing stably attenuated polioviruses and sars-cov is a novel strategy to construct virus variants containing synthetic replacements of virus coding sequences by deoptimizing synonymous codon usage. infection with equal amounts of poliovirus particles revealed a neuroattenuated phenotype and a striking reduction of the specific infectivity of poliovirus particles [145] . similar attempts have been made by baric's group to design sars-cov vaccines. these vaccine candidates provide protection in the mouse model system after challenge with virulent virus (ralph baric, personal communication). due to the distribution effect of many silent mutations over large genome segments, codon-deoptimized viruses should have genetically stable phenotypes, and they may prove suitable as attenuated substrates for the production of vaccines.the production of effective and safe vaccines for animal coronaviruses, previously reported, has not been satisfactory [17, 18, 73, 74] . in contrast, the production of inactivated, subunit, vaccines based on dna and recombinant vectors or vaccines generated by reverse genetics using sars-cov genomes seem more promising.vaccine candidates need to be tested in the sars-cov mouse-adapted model, and in macaques, in all cases using both young and aged animals. later, the absence of side effects and safety has to be assessed in human phase i clinical trials.vaccine manufacturers have the tendency to use well-defined inactivated vaccines. unfortunately, this approach has limited efficacy and elicits immune responses with relatively short immunological memory. a possible balance between efficacy and safety is the development of rna replication-competent propagation-defective vaccine candidates, based on viral replicons that can generate one-cycle viruses using packaging cell lines [148] . severe respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals (fehr & perlman, 2015) . the seventh human coronavirus also known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is identified to be a novel deadly and highly contagious virus that quickly spread to over 150 countries. on march 11, the who declared the outbreak of a pandemic (djalante, shaw, & dewit, 2020) . it is well recognized that the virus has an unusually high speed of transmission and can survive in the environment, on different surfaces for long hours, which poses a serious risk (negahdaripour, 2020) . moreover, the illness causes flu-like symptoms, and the reports show that one person infected can easily infect others (j. .even though coronavirus infection of humans was identified for the first time in 1960; however, scientific research in this area grew only following the outbreak of sars coronavirus in the year 2003 (drosten et al., 2003; ksiazek et al., 2003) . in spite of the reaction from the scientific community that was instantaneous and nearly uniform, at the current state of our knowledge, vaccines for covid-19 seem months or even years away (nabel, 2013) . while there is still much to be understood about the sars-cov-2, considerable research efforts have been made to yield answers to the basic questions of the sars-cov-2 behavior. there is currently off-label use of antiviral drugs for the treatment of this novel virus of coronaviruses that are not totally effective but only partially satisfactory treatment available. there is an urgent need for effective and specific interventions to help tackle the growing global health burden of sars-cov-2. to develop an effective care plan for sars-cov-2 outbreak, it is vital to find new targets for novel therapeutic anti-sars-cov-2 approach. in de novo drug discovery, it is fundamental to understand the molecular entities and specific pathways driving the virus replication during infection. in this paper, we review the available information on molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules. in addition, the computational approaches employed in systematic drug repositioning and vaccine development settings for sars-cov-2 are described. in this procedure, for example, instead of traditional epitope identification upon experimental techniques, being costly and time-consuming (sanchez-trincado, gomez-perosanz, & reche, 2017) , predictive computational methods can be the key way for screening the large-scale peptide candidates. it is hoped that the proposed methodology will open up new avenues for the rapid identification of candidate drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of sars-cov-2.coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded rna viruses with one of the largest viral genomes found in the rna viruses that the majority are disease-causing agents (pyrc, berkhout, & van der hoek, 2007) . several phylogenetic studies subdivided the coronaviruses into four genera known as alpha-covs, beta-covs, gamma-covs, and delta-covs, of which alpha-and beta-covs are pathogenic viruses for mammals and gamma-and delta-covs are known to infect mainly birds (paules, marston, & fauci, 2020) . most coronaviruses are addressed as common cold viruses in humans that are of zoonotic origin and cause a more serious disease in animals (lake, 2020) . in general, the gene pools of groups 1 and 2 coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats which are the reservoir of diverse covs and further spread to humans through an intermediate host or sometimes directly (cui, li, & shi, 2019) . human coronaviruses are typically associated with respiratory tract diseases such as those observed in the common cold including hcov-229e, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, and hcov-hku1 and sometimes enteric illnesses. however, the emergence of highly pathogenic human coronavirus infections in the last two decades has greatly illuminated their potential to cause high morbidity and mortality in humans (cockrell, leist, douglas, & baric, 2018) . the recent coronaviruses sars-cov and mers-cov that are two representative members of the genus betacoronavirus emerged into the human population as zoonotic infections and were the most serious endemic illnesses associated with high mortality in the years 2003 and 2012, respectively (peck, burch, heise, & baric, 2015) . while no case of sars-cov infection has been around since 2004, multiple sporadic cases of mers-cov have been reported in different countries. despite the low interhuman transmissibility, mers-cov has been identified as an infectious disease associated with high mortality rates which is about 35% and much higher than that of sars (~10%; donnelly, malik, elkholy, cauchemez, & van kerkhove, 2019; fong, 2017) . it is likely that discrepancy in the outcome of mers-cov-and sars-cov-infections be explained by differential virus pathogenicity and virulence. the recently identified sars-cov-2 also belongs to the same betacoronavirus genus.the international committee on taxonomy of viruses has named the novel strain coronavirus sars-cov-2, as it is very similar to the known sars-cov in terms of the whole genome sequence (r. lu et al., 2020) . sars-cov-2 has a genomic size of~30 kilobases encoding several structural and nonstructural proteins. the major structural proteins, which form the viral particle, include spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and the nucleocapsid (n) protein. preliminary studies show that the sars-cov-2 full-length genome is quite similar to sars-cov (p. zhou et al., 2020) . however, as more data become available, the sars-cov-2 is undoubtedly distinct from sars-cov and from other bat origin coronaviruses and thus it is imperative to understand the novel coronavirus demanding immediate treatment to develop effective interventions targeting sars-cov-2. in the next phase, researchers and vaccine companies will further develop new vaccines for controlling and preventing this highly pathogenic virus.3 | therapeutic options for 2019-ncov 3.1 | perspectives on targeting "structural" proteins of there is currently no approved treatment for covid-19 in humans, and up to now, a number of antiviral treatments such as ribavirin, primarily have been used based on the experiences from sars and mers medication (singhal, 2020) . in addition, using chloroquine 2 | phosphate, an old antimalarial drug, is found with limited success in patients with covid-19 (gao, tian, & yang, 2020) . 2019-ncov is genetically closely related to sars coronavirus (about 79% identity) and mers-cov (about 50%) but more similar (with 88%) to two batderived sars-like coronaviruses (r. lu et al., 2020) . this virus is found to be a bat covs of the genus betacoronavirus, however, has displayed large genetic distances to its close relatives to be considered a new human coronavirus. however, the modeling study did indicate a similar structure in receptor-binding domain (rbd) of 2019-ncov to that of sars-cov with variations at some key amino acid residues. emerging evidence suggest that 2019-ncov might be bound to the sars-cov receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as a functional cell receptor in human (r. lu et al., 2020) .clinical features of 2019-ncov-infected patients indicate multiple organ failure in addition to pneumonia. ace2 acting in a first key step of 2019-ncov infection may help explain the clinical features of other systems observed in these patients. ace2 is expressed extensively in the endothelium of the heart, liver, kidney, testis, and intestine (m. yang, zhao, & zhang, 2020) and 2019-ncov may probably infect any tissues where ace2 is available. the ongoing works dissecting genetic molecular interactions highlight that sars-cov-2 differ in several critical residues at rbd (particularly gln493) from other sars strains leading to high-affinity interactions with ace2 receptors, being significantly more contagious than those other viruses as a result (wan, shang, graham, baric, & li, 2020) . one suggest that sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibody, cr3022, but not the other sars-cov antibodies (e.g., m396, cr3014), may be effective in neutralizing 2019-ncov and blocking its cell infection . at present, numerous attempts are being made to develop monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against 2019-ncov. there may be more similarities in the mechanisms of cell entry for 2019-ncov and sars-cov which employ ace2 as entry receptor and the cellular serine protease called transmembrane protease, serine 2 for activating s-protein for host cell entry (hoffmann et al., 2020) which might hopefully work as candidate therapeutic target for anti-2019-ncov intervention (hoffmann et al., 2020) . thus, in this context, serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate that is approved for human use in a different indication may provide an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of 2019-ncov-infected patients (kawase, shirato, van der hoek, taguchi, & matsuyama, 2012; y. zhou et al., 2015) . in another effort to limit 2019-ncov infection, furin inhibitors have been reported to develop as a specific antiviral treatment (coutard et al., 2020) . as the priming of viral envelope glycoproteins (such spike [s] protein) by the proteases of the target cells is essential for cell tropism and pathogenicity of virus, the efficacy and extent of this cleavage event may have implication in the development of antiviral agents. human furin is a protease highly expressed in lungs, which cleaves the 2019-ncov s-protein at a specific conserved site absent in sars-cov sequences (bassi, zhang, renner, & klein-szanto, 2017) and thereby generates mature infectious virus particles. overall, because of the fact that s-protein relates to degrees of pathogenicity, transmissibility, and pandemic potential, s-protein-based antiviral therapies offer an attractive and seemingly efficient modality into the area of anti-ncov treatment (jiang, he, & liu, 2005; x. li, geng, peng, meng, & lu, 2020) . treatment regimens based on the use of s-protein-based therapeutics include antagonists of rbd-ace2 interaction, inhibitors of s-protein cleavage proteases, neutralizing antibodies, s-protein inhibitors, and small interfering rnas (malik et al., 2020) . nevertheless, a potential concern for the treatment of covid-19 infection is the emergence of drug resistance by the rapid genomic evolution of virus during therapy. the higher risk of drug resistance has most often been noted to occur when targeting single virus proteins (zumla, chan, azhar, hui, & yuen, 2016) . even though these therapeutic strategies have demonstrated in vitro efficacy, they have not undergone animal or clinical testing so far and may, therefore, be of limited use in our present covid-19 problem.it is indicated that the key to the development of new drugs able to control the cause of the recent outbreak of the deadly viral pneumonia in china requires the identification of a conserved target region within the whole coronavirus genus (h. yang et al., 2005) . despite all structural proteins including s, e, m, and n proteins, nonstructural proteins (nsps) withstand considerable sequence variation among different covs (woo et al., 2005) . nsps responsible for viral replication and transcription may be adopted to target cov. the sars-cov encodes 16 nsps as potential virulence factors. among these nsps, an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), the nsp12, which is the central subunit of the cov replicative machinery and its essential cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 play a crucial role in the replication of the sars-cov genome (kirchdoerfer & ward, 2019; subissi et al., 2014) .accordingly, there should be possibly interference with the binding of nsp7 or nsp8 to nsp12 to inhibit the rdrp activity of nsp12 for the development of novel antiviral agents. as the comparative analyses of their amino acid sequences show high similarity with nsp7 (98.8%) and nsp8 (97.5%) of sars-cov (ruan et al., 2020) , screening for compounds disrupting nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex may evolve as novel therapies of sars-cov-2. based on virtual screening and docking methods, seven compounds (saquinavir, tipranavir, lonafarnib, tegobuvir, olysio, filibuvir, and cepharanthine) have been ghaebi et al.| 3 suggested to have potential as efficacious new inhibitors of virus replication process (ruan et al., 2020) offering more opportunities for clinical assessment of anti-sars-cov-2 drugs.usually, beta-coronaviruses produce a~800 kda polypeptide that is posttranscriptionally cleaved at certain processing sites into separate subunits. the papain-like protease and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3cl pro ) are main proteases usually responsible for this proteolytic processing to generate various nsps and are thus important for viral replication (anand, ziebuhr, wadhwani, mesters, & hilgenfeld, 2003) . recent studies revealed that 3cl pro is conserved in sars-cov-2 having 12-point mutations identified in the receptorbinding site that affects its binding ability to some medicinal plant compounds already used to treat viral diseases like inhibitor of sars-cov 3cl pro named ml188. therefore, further optimization and drug development efforts were made to develop new compounds to inhibit sars-cov-2 3cl pro and the results identified nine novel natural compounds predicted to bind with the receptor-binding site of sars-cov-2 3cl pro which possess therapeutic activities (ul qamar, alqahtani, alamri, & chen, 2020). these investigations lack experimental validation, and to further address this anti-covid-19 drug discovery with putative clinical application, more in vitro and in vivo studies are required. the enzyme nsp13 helicase another potential target in the viral replication apparatus has been investigated in sars-cov-2 and could be structurally characterized by computational methods. its nucleotide sequence predicted a protein of 596 amino acids. similar to previous reports, molecular dynamics simulations together with virtual screening efforts were applied to identify the interaction profile of important binding site residues of sars-cov-2 nsp13 helicase and potential therapeutic small molecules to find potent and selective inhibitors against sars-cov-2 (mirza & froeyen, 2020) . in silico predictions were used for determining adme parameters of the identified potential hits against sars-cov-2 nsp13 target, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, toxicity (adme-tox) and resulting top hits were selected following removal of hits that exhibited poor admet-tox found to contain highrisk chemical groups (mirza & froeyen, 2020) .to improve control strategies, the research studies have attempted to develop effective treatments and prophylactic strategies including vaccination. considering the cost per cured subject, vaccination appears more favorable. alternatively, with rising morbidity and death rates, the benefit of the vaccine in reducing the disease burden will be higher. for this, the rest of the review will focus on what is known about the development of vaccine against covid-19. table 1 ) or plan to do so within a few months (table 2) .although the virus's s-protein is considered a promising immunogen for inclusion in a nucleic acid covid-19 vaccine, there continues to be debate over the best approach to ensure optimal immune response. for example, in the current debate, target antigen design in a full-length protein or the receptor-binding domain is challenging (lurie et al., 2020) . however, several areas of consensus that are herein disclosed have emerged in this area. beginning from the basics, it has been demonstrated that immune response to coronavirus infection or vaccination involves early neutralizing immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody response against viral surface proteins (zand & wang, 2020) . there is also some evidence that coronaviruses make use of certain antibodies for entry to the cell as an alternative mechanism of target cell binding . it is also clinically demonstrated that sera from sars patients apparently contain both neutralizing igg antibodies and those that cause ade . this is particularly important when modeling optimal vaccine strategy for reducing severe disease. of note, within the different vaccine types (except for live-attenuated virus vaccines), the general goal is to induce adaptive immune response against s or n viral proteins and also the increase in highaffinity igg production is of the utmost importance for planning vaccine actions. these data collectively suggest that one approach may be to manipulate and modify the protein sequences to disable the potential for ade if possible (zand & wang, 2020) . in addition,given that such an adverse effect may be associated with t helper type 2 (th2) immune responses, extended human safety testing will be critical. to this point, using a suitable adjuvant with a capacity to trigger a type 1t helper (th1) response and high neutralizing antibody titers, theoretically, is likely to be protective to avoid immunopathology (lurie et al., 2020) . it worth noting that the use of an adjuvant in the vaccine is a reasonable approach in a pandemic that may substantially reduce the amount of vaccine material required for immunization. owing to the limited worldwide production capacity for vaccine, this strategy will allow more vaccine doses to be produced for widespread vaccination of populations and therefore contributes to protection of more people .the e protein has also been proposed as an attractive vaccine target for developing live-attenuated vaccines, which is based on prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause mers and sars-cov (almazán et al., 2013) . for both sars and mers-cov, the construction of an attenuated virus deleted in e protein could result in a replication-competent but propagation-defective virus that supports the efficacy of the attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates (almazán et al., 2013) . deletion of e protein can be accomplished to 2019-ncov and it is expected to lead to a similar breakthrough given approaches have been carried out to elucidate the genetic and antigenic properties of the virus to accelerate novel vaccine design.peptide-based vaccines have received more attention due to their ease of production by the chemical synthesis of dominant protective epitopes (dudek, perlmutter, aguilar, croft, & purcell, 2010) . just as neutralizing the free virus particles before cell entry is required to prevent cells from being infected by covid-19, rational vaccine design strategies based on the characterization of epitopes on the most exposed protein of the virus that can be recognized by b cell antibodies and t lymphocytes may be able to overcome the ongoing outbreak. using immunoinformatics approach to find protein epi- the antigenicity analysis pointed out that only 13 mhc-i epitopes and 3 mhc-ii epitopes had the antigenic propensity (bhattacharya et al., 2020) . furthermore, of the s-protein oligopeptides, the most immunogenic and uniquely viral epitopes were identified through comparative homo sapiens-coronavirus proteome analysis. using the peptide match program, the 2109-ncov and the human proteomes were compared and searched for viral peptides that are absent in the human proteome to increase antiviral specificity and minimizing the risk for cross-reactions (lucchese, 2020) . a total of 66 non-self sequences in the virus genome were obtained as a result that represents the best targets for vaccine development due to their potential for immunogenicity (richman, vonderheide, & rech, 2019) .in addition, the identification of the potential t cell epitopes li et al., 2008) . the authors claim that immune targeting of sars-cov-derived b cell and t cell epitopes that map identically to sars-cov-2 proteins may offer substantial protection against the new virus (ahmed, quadeer, & mckay, 2020) . what strengthens the idea is that the determined epitopes comprise no mutations in the available sars-cov-2 sequences (ahmed et al., 2020) .since genomic variations of the pathogen have significant clinical consequences, the genetic diversity of sars-cov-2 and strategies to develop vaccine candidates are described in detail in the next section.one hypothesis is that the rapid spread of sars-cov-2 may be due to its evolution driven by viral mutations. understandably, the evolution of rna viruses continues to occupy a great deal of attention (dolan, whitfield, & andino, 2018) . the rapid evolution of rna viruses that utilize a highly divergent rna-dependent rna polymerase is often more evident than those of dna-based viruses.in fact, enormous genetic diversity is a critical determinant of their adaptative capacity (lauring, frydman, & andino, 2013) . nucleotide substitution in dna is often involved as one of the most important mechanisms provoking viral evolution in nature (lauring & andino, 2010) . in the last few months, genome-sequencing projects have been conducted by the worldwide scientific community to understand the evolutionary dynamics and characteristics of this results an ∼800 kda polyprotein were described as the two most variable locations in the core genome (ceraolo & giorgi, 2020) .another important aspect of virus replication may be at the functional contact between virus and host. several viruses, including coronaviruses, require host cellular factors to replicate (zumla et al., 2016) . furthermore, repeated observations in other families of rna viruses indicate that many, if not most, mutations are surface-located and that the conserved residues are probably core residues of viral proteins (cheng & brooks iii, 2013; patel & kukol, 2017; warren, wan, conant, & korkin, 2013) . (deng, hu, wang, & deng, 2012) . subunit vaccines offer many advantages over live-attenuated or inactivated organisms.unlike inactivated or live-attenuated virus vaccines, subunit vaccines are known to provide better efficacy as they are unable to revert to the virulent form of the pathogen and eliminate the risk of incomplete inactivation, thus making them biologically safe; however, they typically require coadministration with adjuvants (zhang et al., 2012) . based on this information, the subunit candidates such as full-length s-protein and/or the rbd element of sars-cov-2 prove valuable for prevention against covid-19 (shang, yang, rao, & rao, 2020) , though they are expensive to manufacture and need for repeated injections (phillpotts, venugopal, & brooks, 1996) .moreover, subunit vaccines can be designed to contain well-characterized neutralizing epitopes defined as those epitopes which elicit a neutralizing antibody response but avoiding epitopes with pathological ade effects to improve immunogenicity (naz & dabir, 2007) . another scientific challenge for vaccine development may be dependent to the strategies of vaccine delivery. evidence of respiratory tract infection and findings of sars-2 in stool (holshue et al., 2020; q. li et al., 2020) suggest that mucosal delivery routes by oral or aerosol administration of vaccine appear to be the possible modes of sars-cov-2 immunization.epidemiological studies have shown that the disease caused by sars-cov-2 is significantly associated with a higher age in which ghaebi et al. | 9 individuals above 50 years of age often exhibit more severe pathology following sars-cov-2 infection and are more likely to die from infection. in many viral infections, the naive younger individuals experience milder manifestations of the disease. because it affects the health of older people more strongly, vaccine as a public health measure, must protect this vulnerable population (amanat & krammer, 2020) . unfortunately, it is precisely in this population that vaccines are the least efficacious because of immune senescence (sambhara & mcelhaney, 2009 ). as of current influenza vaccines, specific formulations including high-dose antigen or using an adjuvant may be particularly useful for this segment of the population (amanat & krammer, 2020; diazgranados et al., 2013) . interestingly, even if vaccination does not result in protection in all recipients, it is still able to stop the transmission of the virus and thereby benefits older individuals (amanat & krammer, 2020) .finally, once a successful sars-2 vaccine is developed and available, the responsibility to let the global access to it should be a part of planning. nonetheless, apart from the availability of the vaccine, still social, clinical, and economic hurdles face sars-2 vaccine and vaccination programmes that include, for example, willingness of the public to get a new vaccination, the potential variation in efficiency for quite different populations, as well as severe adverse reactions arising from the new vaccine (pang et al., 2020) .our review of the available relevant literature summarized the published information regarding covid-19 vaccine research and development. in summary, extensive bioinformatics analysis, in the past few months, has helped provide a unique opportunity to a better understanding of determinants of immunogenicity, immunodominance, and structure-function relationships that can to a great extent reduce the experimental cost in epitope identification for vaccine design as well as limit the pool of peptides available for analysis. while research into such efforts is in its early stages, the prospect of a preventative or therapeutic vaccine seems realistic as a result of a more intense global cooperation and also by taking advantage of the gathered data on sars and mers. as data collection continues, we are getting closer to finding better ways to conquer this disease. first and foremost, accurate and up to date data on the status and timing of vaccine production and release must be accessible. meanwhile, the collaboration of countries from all over the world is clearly needed in producing a preventive or therapeutically desired result.the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.m. g. and m. a. were involved in drafting the manuscript. m. a. has critically reviewed the manuscript content.majid ahmadi http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4787-5261cells, indicating that ace2 is likely the cell receptor of sars-cov-2 . mclellan et al. showed biophysical and structural evidence that sars-cov-2 s protein binds ace2 with higher affinity than sars-cov s protein (wrapp et al. 2020) .to date, although some repurposed drugs showed inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2, no drugs have been licensed to be used in the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection or other coronavirus infections in humans, and no vaccines have been licensed to prevent these infections. just days after chinese scientists shared the genetic map of sars-cov-2, scientists around the world, along with a list of biotech and vaccine companies, promptly launched a race to pursue different types of vaccines to prevent infection with this novel virus. up to the end of april 2020, at least 115 sars-cov-2 vaccine projects have been announced to be in development, including vectored vaccines, oral vaccines, subunit vaccines, inactivated vaccines, peptide-based vaccines, nucleotide-based vaccine, etc. several sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates have recently been approved for clinical phase i or ii development (thanh le et al. 2020) .among these sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates, mrna vaccines are quite remarkable. what is mrna vaccine? unlike traditional vaccines, an mrna vaccine consists of an mrna sequence encoding a disease-specific antigen. once delivered into target cells, the antigen is expressed, processed, presented and recognized by the immune system, and a strong humoral and t cell immune response will be instigated. compared to vaccine production of whole microbes, live attenuated and subunit vaccines, mrna vaccines are believed to be faster and less expensive to produce, and they do not involve in any living stage of the pathogenic virus or bacteria. this manufacturing process makes mrna vaccines a promising bioproduct and potentially fills the gap between the desperate demand for vaccines to control disease outbreaks and epidemics, with the potential to scale and standardize the vaccine manufacturing process. the process of mrna vaccine development is illustrated in fig. 1 , exemplified by the mrna vaccine coding the s gene of sars-cov-2. currently, most of the components needed for mrna vaccine production are available at the good manufacturing practices (gmp) grade to satisfy commercialization.two forms of mrna vaccines have been developed, including conventional mrna vaccines and self-amplifying mrna (sam) vaccines. conventional mrna encoding target antigen can be synthetically produced, including an open reading frame (orf) for the target antigen and 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (utrs), through a cell-free enzymatic transcription reaction. the in vitro transcription reaction includes linearized plasmid dna encoding the pathogen antigen as a template, recombinant rna polymerase, and nucleoside triphosphates. a cap analog and a poly(a) tail are added sequentially to the transcriptional product following the reaction to form a functional mrna. after injection, transient and low levels of antigen expression are driven . sam vaccines are derivatives of alphavirus rna replication, with the structural protein sequences replaced with the antigen gene, generating multiple copies of the antigen-encoding mrna and expressing high levels of the heterologous gene. then, in vitro transcribed (ivt) mrna is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles and delivered into cells. consequently, humoral and t cell immune responses are stimulated. the immune response mechanism instigated by mrna remains to be elucidated. the dimension of the immune response is dependent on the quality of the ivt mrna, delivery vehicle, and administration route.in the last two decades, mrna vaccines have been investigated extensively for infectious disease prevention and cancer immunotherapy. several mrna vaccines against infectious disease have showed a promising future, such as mrna vaccines against influenza viruses, rabies virus, hiv, ebola virus, and zika virus (demoulins et al. 2016; maruggi et al. 2019) . although clinical trials of mrna vaccines for infectious disease are still in their early stage, a plethora of publications have shown that mrnabased vaccines are a promising novel platform that is highly flexible, scalable, inexpensive and cold-chain-free.the growing body of preclinical and clinical results demonstrates that prophylaxis and therapy with mrna promises to be useful for the prevention of infectious disease and that mrna vaccines are safe and tolerated in animal models and humans. despite the great challenges in the creation of new processes to generate mrna vaccines, such as delivery and translation efficiency, these processes hopefully will be streamlined to establish large-scale production. it is just a matter of time for mrna vaccines to be used in humans and animals.several biopharmaceutical companies have announced promptly the establishment of mrna vaccine projects for sars-cov-2 since its outbreak. on january 23, 2020, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) announced the initiation of three programs to develop vaccines against sars-cov-2. moderna, an mrna-based biotechnology company, announced that it has received funding from cepi and would manufacture an mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 using their mrna vaccine platform technology, and it has partnered with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) to develop a vaccine for the wuhan strain of coronavirus. the niaid will conduct investigational new drug (ind)-enabling studies and a phase i clinical study in the u.s. in projects conducted by moderna, approximately 1000 people have received different versions of mrna vaccines so far in seven clinical trials designed to prevent illness from other respiratory viruses, including a strain of the flu, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), and human metapneumovirus (hmpv). mrna vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 developed by moderna is the first one entering phase i clinical trial (moderna 2020) .in february 2019, cepi agreed to provide up to $34 million in support of curevac's technology development, which will provide a rapid supply of lipid-nanoparticleformulated mrna vaccine candidates that can target known pathogens and prepare for rapid response to new and previously unknown pathogens. the principle of fig. 1 the streamlined process of the creation of an mrna vaccine coding the s gene of sars-cov-2, including the design, formulation, testing, and approval.curevac's proprietary technology is the use of mrna as a genetic information carrier to instruct the human body to produce its own proteins capable of fighting a wide range of diseases. additionally, the federal ministry of education and research has committed a total of 90 million euros to support this work (smith 2020) . pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in china have also stepped up to the development of vaccines of sars-cov-2. four sars-cov-2 vaccines have been approved for phase i or ii clinical trial in china at the end of april of 2020. several biotechnology companies have announced the development of mrna vaccines against this mated coronavirus. in early january 2020, stermirna therapeutics, cooperating with shanghai east hospital of tongji university, proclaimed that no more than 40 days will be needed to produce vaccine samples based on the new generation of mrna technology and some preliminary procedures. the samples would be sent for tests and be brought to clinics as soon as possible (xinhua net 2020). on february 12, 2020, the institute of advanced technology of shenzhen announced that the first batch of mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 was being prepared under gmp standards. the mrna matching the requirement for the clinical trial would be ready in april 2020 (siat 2020). on february 14, zhuhai lifanda biotechnology announced that an antibody against antigen encoded by mrna was detected in mouse serum at day 12 after the mice had been immunized. data on rhesus macaques immunized with mrna vaccine candidates would be obtained soon. the mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 would go into clinical testing within 2-3 months. a gmp factory would be put into use in april, 2020 (cnbeta 2020).like other coranaviruses, s protein of sars-cov-2 plays an essential role in binding to receptors on the host cell to initiate an infection and determines host tropism. it is also the major target of neutralizing antibodies and it may be the main antigen of development of sars-cov-2 vaccines by most related groups. according to the public information, s protein or receptor binding domain (rbd) sites are main antigens edcoded by sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates. however, due to the limited information and patent protection on the adaptation of antigens of sars-cov-2 vaccines in development, the antigen information of most sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates are unclear. the expected immune response, such as antibody or t cell mediated immune response, stimulated by these sars-cov-2 vaccines in development are not clear either. thus accordingly, the protection against sars-cov-2 can not to be predicted.during the development of sars-cov and mres-cov vaccines, some groups found that enhanced lung inflammation following homologous challenge in mice and nonhuman primates was mediated by s specific igg (liu et al. 2019; wan et al. 2020) . antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) was initially found to be induced by dengue vaccine (katzelnick et al. 2017) . ade was also observed in other vaccines later, such as influenza vaccine (winarski et al. 2019) . ade modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ade also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes. currently, immunologists are worrying that sars-cov-2 mrna vaccines based on s protein maybe induce ade, which will blur the adaptation in the prevention and control of sars-cov-2 pandemic. however, in a recent paper, qin et al. reported inactivated sars-cov-2 vaccine was safe in nonhuman primate and has not induced ade in macaques (gao et al. 2020) . the other obstacle to developing a successful sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine is the abundant glycosylation sites on the s protein which facilitate the escaping of sars-cov-2 from neutralization by the s protein specific antibodies (vankadari and wilce 2020).as a novel vaccine platform, mrna vaccine technology is not mature to be used in immune prophylaxis and therapy. it still needs improvement and has uncertainty in the sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine development. the mechanisms of immunity induction of mrna vaccine in vivo are under elucidation. published results showed mrna vaccines stimulated potent immune response, but in human, the immune response is not strong enough with low dose of antibodies (pardi et al. 2018b ). the delivery tool and administration route determine the dimension of immune response by mrna vaccine (pardi et al. 2018a) .so far, there at least 14 sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine projects had been announced globally (who, 27 may 2020). regularly, the general stages of the development cycle of a vaccine include the exploratory stage, the preclinical stage, clinical development, regulatory review and approval, manufacturing, and quality control. the process of the creation, testing and production of a vaccine in mass quantities can take many years because the industry is highly regulated. for mrna vaccines against sars-cov-2 infection, developers should speed up the process to make them available as soon as possible. however, until a safe, effective vaccine is commercial available, the best protection from infection with sars-cov-2 is to follow the suggestions of public health experts.conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.animal and human rights statement this article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.alleviation of the enormous burden of mortality and morbidity associated with the covid-19 pandemic will probably depend on the development of effective vaccines that could be rolled out widely. many candidate vaccines are in development [1] , but recent estimates cite at least 1-1.5 years to vaccine rollout [2] . a significant proportion of that time is due to the requirement to assess efficacy and safety in placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, which typically involve several thousand participants followed for long enough in the field to assess differences in disease incidence between vaccine and control groups, with many participants taking precautions to avoid exposure. we suggest that, in the circumstances of a devastating global pandemic, controlled human challenge studies (following the normal initial safety, vaccine dose finding, and immunogenicity studies-phases 1/2 in figure 1 ) may be an acceptable way to bypass phase 3 testing, and speed the licensure of efficacious vaccines.volunteers for human challenge studies would be drawn from previously uninfected individuals at relatively low risk of complications or mortality from sars-cov-2 infection (eg, young adults, without chronic health conditions, and not otherwise sick) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and who are at substantial risk of natural exposure to sars-cov-2 (eg, resident in areas with high transmission rates). such a target group might comprise uninfected persons aged 20-45 years, an age range in which the risk of death or serious complications following infection is substantially lower than in older age groups [4, 5] .the controlled challenge model would need to be standardized before using it to test vaccines. volunteers, previously uninfected, would be required for an initial dose-escalation study of the viral challenge to select a dose of virus exposure such that most placebo recipients become infected (for statistical reasons), and have a clinical response that is not more severe than the one associated with natural infection (for ethical reasons). the latter would require comparison with a cohort of individuals of similar age who had been infected naturally. for this standardization, volunteers may spend 2 weeks in a clinical isolation facility prior to the challenge, with viral and serologic testing, to exclude those with previous or recent infection (or a shorter duration if suitable serological tests for recent infections are developed). overall, these preparatory studies (upper-left black square in figure 1 ) may take several weeks and could start before vaccine candidates are available for evaluation.multiple measures would be put in place to ensure that, prior to consenting, potential participants fully comprehend the unusual risks involved in the study.after the controlled human challenge model had been set up, vaccines could be evaluated. volunteers who had not been previously infected would be randomized to receive either the candidate vaccine(s) under investigation or placebo. after an interval to permit a full immune response to the vaccine, a controlled exposure to sars-cov-2 would be administered. appropriate vaccine schedules (eg, dose, number of doses) will have been determined, to the extent possible, in the conventional phase 1/2 immunogenicity and safety studies that preceded the challenge study.following the challenge, the participants would be carefully followed, to monitor whether those vaccinated had a different response to viral challenge. because the challenge studies would be relatively small and some volunteers might show few clinical symptoms, there would need to be careful consideration of the choice of the primary endpoint, through discussions with regulatory authorities. possibilities would include viral load, measured at least daily (eg, in throat swabs), and then cumulated over the course of the infection (as has been done in influenza challenge studies) [8] , and time to first clinical symptoms. for some vaccines, the endpoint might be the proportion infected. throughout the study, intense immunological monitoring would seek any correlates of vaccine effect. the required size of such studies would depend upon the endpoints chosen, but they might require of the order of 100 volunteers.any volunteers in whom infection was confirmed would receive excellent care for covid-19, including priority for any scarce life-saving resources, in state-of-the-art facilities. throughout the trial and until infectiousness was ruled out, all participants would remain isolated in a secure and comfortable setting (eg, in settings converted from those used for influenza challenge studies).if this human challenge study showed a vaccine candidate to be efficacious, an expanded placebo-controlled study would be conducted in the field, involving at least 3000 vaccinated persons, primarily for short-term safety assessment, but also to gather further evidence on immunogenicity ( figure 1 , rightmost black box). participants would be carefully monitored for adverse effects following vaccination, to gather safety data sufficient for submission for licensure. this study (not involving a challenge) should be conducted on the eventual primary initial target group for an effective vaccine-including the elderly and those with concomitant illnesses that increase the risk of serious disease following infection. with prior planning, this large-scale assessment of safety could be completed in several months, as initially only short-term adverse effects would be assessed.together, the information from the challenge study and the short-term follow-up of those in the expanded (phase 2) field study may produce evidence sufficient to justify accelerated licensure.participants of the expanded field study could continue to be followed longer term in parallel with the submission for licensure, so that suitable actions could be taken if any long-term adverse effects, including disease enhancement, were identified. as with standard vaccine licensure, additional, postapproval studies would be required to assess safety and effectiveness in routine use. any necessary studies of dosage and safety in special groups (eg, children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons) could be conducted, before extending vaccination to these groups, as judged appropriate.it is possible that the protection that was apparent in a challenge study will not be replicated when the vaccine is used to protect against natural infection. this would have to be carefully monitored in the early stages of vaccine rollout, for example through case-control studies. in such an event, appropriate modification will be made to the vaccination program (including potentially stopping vaccination).a particular concern with respect to some vaccine constructs against coronavirus is that they may induce more severe disease following infection, as has been reported in animal models of both sars and mers vaccine candidates [9] . if any vaccine candidate shows evidence of such effects in animal models, it is likely to be ruled out for human testing. however, for those candidates that are taken forward for human testing, the possibility of enhancement should be borne in mind and the challenge studies should be designed in such a way that small groups of volunteers are challenged sequentially. in this way, studies could be stopped at an early stage, upon first strong indication of vaccine-induced enhanced disease. if the vaccine candidate did enhance disease, the controlled human challenge model would provide much more rapid evidence to support stopping the testing of a harmful vaccine candidate, with far fewer vaccinated persons, than a traditional phase 3 efficacy study.the proposed trial method would potentially cut the wait time for the rollout of an efficacious vaccine. challenge studies (which always directly expose all participants to a pathogen to assess efficacy) generally require fewer participants, followed over a shorter period than do standard efficacy studies (in which many participants are never exposed). rollout of an efficacious vaccine to age groups not included in the challenge studies may depend on immunological bridging, but this would be a component of the expanded safety studies discussed above. it is possible that this process could take several months shorter than reliance on standard phase 3 testing to assess efficacy. while rollout to other populations might require initial bridging studies, these could be conducted relatively quickly.it seems clear that, in the absence of an efficacious vaccine, the global death toll from covid-19 will be enormous. a recent modelling study suggests that, even with mitigation strategies focusing on shielding the elderly and slowing but not interrupting transmission, there may be 20 million this year [10] . if the use of human challenge helped to make the vaccine available before the epidemic has completely passed, the savings in human lives could be in the thousands or conceivably millions. intense social distancing and related control measures, held in place for many months between now and the availability of vaccine, will themselves take a toll on economies, societies, and population health. advancing the registration and rollout of an efficacious vaccine, even by a few months, could save many thousands of lives, and commands enormous societal value.deliberate exposure of study participants to sars-cov-2 gives rise to understandable ethical worries. it may seem impermissible to ask people to take on risk of severe illness or death, even for an important collective gain. but we actually ask people to take such risks for others' direct gain every time we ask volunteer firefighters to rush into burning buildings, relatives to donate a live organ to loved ones, healthy volunteers to participate in drug and vaccine toxicity trials with no prospect of improving their health (and some risk of undermining it) [11] , relatively healthy volunteers to participate in studies involving long antiretroviral drug interruptions that risk their health with negligible prospect of improving it [12] , and other challenge studies in which healthy volunteers expose themselves to pathogens [13] . this spring, we are clearly within our right when we invite citizens to volunteer for emergency medical services (ems) to fight a pandemic that augments both the personal risks for ems workers and the social value of their work, and initial trials for the moderna sars-cov-2 vaccine are being accelerated by skipping prior animal testing and the margin of safety that it would have added [14] .one major reason why it is permissible to risk medical harm to volunteers in medical studies, even when their personal health care does not require that risk, is that these volunteers will have autonomously consented to take on these risks. adult persons can legitimize many interventions in their bodies and health that are normally prohibited, simply by saying "yes, " with full understanding and voluntariness. in the present case, the study would involve multiple tests of comprehension of all risks (and the risk factors for serious outcomes among individuals in otherwise low-risk age groups may be somewhat clearer by the time recruitment takes place), so that the decision is deeply informed and voluntary. the exclusive recruitment of participants aged 20-45 years, although children are less likely to have severe symptoms upon covid-19 infection [6, 7] , seeks to safeguard the quality of participants' consent. the wide news coverage and widespread fear of covid-19 should keep it clear that exposure to this virus is no small matter. while in other studies mentioned above, nonconsenting sex partners and fetuses of study participants may get infected [15, 16] , the proposed controlled challenge study would avoid risk to nonparticipants by isolating participants whilst infectious.but a remaining key question, for deeming human challenge studies ethical, pertains to risk. are the risks to participants, even when they are justified by the social importance of the trial and backed by participants' willful permission, also being kept to the necessary minimum? and do the risks fall below a postulated cap on the acceptable risk of medical trials, even ones of the highest social value and with participants' consent [15] ?the proposed challenge studies seek to contain the risk to participants in 6 different ways. first, the study will recruit only healthy patients from age groups in which the risk of severe disease and death following sars-cov-2 infection is low. second, there is the possibility that the vaccine candidate will protect at least some of those who are vaccinated. third, in the absence of an effective vaccine, a high proportion of the general population is likely to be naturally infected with sars-cov-2 at some point [17] , including those who might participate in a challenge study; by volunteering to be artificially infected they may be just hastening an event that is likely to occur in later months anyhow. fourth, only people with an especially high baseline risk phase 3 -field e cacy trial to assess protection against natural infection submission for licensure figure 1 . the process to vaccine licensure through a controlled human challenge trial and large study to assess short-term safety (black) compared to the conventional phase 3 trial route to licensure (grey). submission for licensure could occur substantially earlier with a controlled human challenge trial. of getting exposed during or soon after the trial period should be recruited (eg, people residing in areas with high transmission rates). fifth, participants would be monitored carefully and frequently following the challenge and afforded the best available care if needed (eg, guaranteed access to state-of-the-art facilities of the health system, notwithstanding the possibility of severe shortages of medical care during the evolving pandemic). sixth, by the time vaccine candidates are being tested, some therapeutics may be approved, which may reduce participants' risk of morbidity and mortality further. for these 6 reasons, mortality and morbidity from participation notwithstanding, net mortality and morbidity from participation should remain low or negative.a novel strain of coronavirus forces us to consider unconventional approaches. we believe that controlled sars-cov-2 vaccine challenge studies may accelerate the time it takes to evaluate and license vaccines and hence could make vaccines available sooner for widespread rollout. such an approach is not without risks, but every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally. importantly, challenge studies are conducted against the background of competent volunteers' informed consent, minimization of study risks, and high baseline risks of infection for participants. they do not violate participants' individual rights on the altar of emergency response, but heed both individual rights and the global public health emergency.as far as we are aware, the current plan for evaluating the efficacy of covid-19 vaccines is through slower phase 3 trials. it will take some time to develop and operationalize challenge studies and we are not suggesting that ongoing development of any vaccines which become ready for phase 3 trials must be paused during this period. however, we believe that challenge studies could be set up before the time that most vaccines would be ready for efficacy testing.in addition to their use for assessing the efficacy of vaccines, human challenge studies may also help evaluate drugs that might be given either as preexposure prophylaxis to prevent infection in individuals at high risk of infection, or as postexposure prophylaxis, given shortly after a potential exposure, either to abort infection or to prevent the occurrence of disease. challenge studies may also be a way of advancing understanding of the pathogenesis of the progression from infection to disease.to further assess the potential of human challenge studies to speed vaccine development, we suggest that an expert group might be convened, including those with experience of human challenge studies of other pathogens, regulators, vaccine trialists, ethicists, potential participants, and relevant funding agencies, to plan if and how such studies might be taken forward ethically and expeditiously.alleviation of the enormous burden of mortality and morbidity associated with the covid-19 pandemic will probably depend on the development of effective vaccines that could be rolled out widely. many candidate vaccines are in development [1] , but recent estimates cite at least 1-1.5 years to vaccine rollout [2] . a significant proportion of that time is due to the requirement to assess efficacy and safety in placebo-controlled phase 3 trials, which typically involve several thousand participants followed for long enough in the field to assess differences in disease incidence between vaccine and control groups, with many participants taking precautions to avoid exposure. we suggest that, in the circumstances of a devastating global pandemic, controlled human challenge studies (following the normal

coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) [1,2]. the emergence of sars-cov-2 was first detected in wuhan, china, in december 2019. sars-cov-2 infections spread rapidly and globally, causing enormous distress and loss of life in no time. though most sars-cov-2 infections cause only mild symptoms, 10–15% of patients develop the severe disease that requires hospitalization, with 5% requiring intensive care. in the united states alone, the centers for disease control and prevention reports over 2 million covid-19 patients and over 110 thousand related deaths so far. worldwide, sars-cov-2 has infected over 8 million people and caused over 400 thousand deaths as of 16 june 2020 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).as a newly emerged strain of coronavirus, sars-cov-2 was rapidly identified as the causative agent of the outbreak. sars-cov-2 contains a genomic sequence closely related to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus (sars-cov) [3], and both these viruses are zoonotic. this is thus among some of the rare cases of an animal to human transmission of virus infection with pandemic potential [4]. common symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection include fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing. in severe cases, the infection can result in death [5]. the pathogenesis of the sars-cov-2 infection is not completely clear yet. our present understanding of covid-19 pathogenesis so far is based on a limited number of investigated cases of sars-cov-2 and extrapolations from other similar coronavirus infections, such as sars-cov and mers-cov [6,7,8]. the probable courses of immunopathological events postulated based on limited studies on covid-19 along with past studies with sars-cov have been illustrated in figure 1. transmission of infection between humans is facilitated by close contact with covid-19 patients, as evidenced by the rapid global spread of the infection all around the world in a short period of time. sars-cov-2 likely originated in bats and may have amplified in an intermediate host before infecting humans. sars-cov-2 enters the human body via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors [9]. current evidence indicates the mortality rate for sars-cov-2 could be approximately 3%, which is significantly lower than sars-cov (10%) and mers-cov (40%) [10]. nonetheless, sars-cov-2 has much higher transmissibility (r0: 1.4–5.5) than both sars-cov (r0: 2–5) and mers-cov (r0: <1) [11].given the severity of covid-19, the rapid global dispersion of sars-cov-2, and the declaration of the sars-cov-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization, there is a pressing and increasing need for new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutic options for this new threat. however, in this early phase of the sars-cov-2 outbreak, a comprehensive prevention and treatment strategies is lacking due to limited knowledge about this virus. in efforts to mitigate the current covid-19 pandemic, government agencies and scientific and medical communities worldwide are working on new approaches to reduce infection and decrease mortality rates among infected individuals [12]. so far, neither vaccines nor direct-acting antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of this disease. for now, most of the countries with a high case burden have adopted a combination of large-scale testing, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine, in parallel with social-distancing measures to curb the covid-19 pandemic, until a durable cure or prevention strategy is developed. while these measures have slowed down the spread of the disease and bought us more time to develop treatment and prevention strategies, there is a pressing need for a resilient solution that can effectively control the disease. the most effective strategy to control the disease is to develop a vaccine, and many industrial and academic organizations are racing to develop one but face many challenges to achieve this goal at an unprecedented timeline. therapeutic drug options have been actively explored, including through many ongoing clinical trials, to reduce the severity of disease and death rate. this review provides an overview and analysis of most current advances in vaccines and therapeutics development against covid-19 while also discussing some of the major roadblocks and challenges that we face to halt this emerging virus infection.remdesivir is a promising antiviral drug against rna viruses, including sars/mers-cov in cultured cells, mice, and nonhuman primate models [17]. remdesivir is an adenosine analog that activates nucleoside triphosphate metabolites to inhibit viral rna polymerases. in a nonhuman primate model, intravenous administration of remdesivir (10 mg/kg) resulted in 100% protection against ebola virus infection [18]. remdesivir is currently under clinical development for the treatment of ebola virus infection [19]. in a recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous administration in adults hospitalized with covid-19, remdesivir shortened the recovery time of patients by 31%, though it could not reduce the mortality rate to a significant extent. these initial results of remdesivir-mediated improvement of recovery time in clinical trials granted its fda approval for critically ill covid-19 patients [20,21,22]. nonetheless, given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir, it is apparent that treatment with this antiviral drug alone may be less likely to be sufficient. a combination of remidesivir with other drugs is another alternative approach currently being explored in clinical trials to improve patient outcomes in covid-19. since a hyperactive immune response, leading to cytokine storm, has been found to be associated with increased disease severity and mortality, the addition of anti-inflammatory agent baricitinib to the remdesivir regimen is being explored in clinical trials (nct04401579) to examine its potential in improving mortality outcomes. several other existing antiviral drugs previously developed or used as treatments for other viral diseases are also being actively investigated as possible covid-19 treatment options, with some already moved into clinical trials (table 1). while the existence of evidence in support of these antiviral drugs is scant and preliminary in studies so far, more comprehensive studies on these drugs can build and extend the arsenal of anti-sars-cov-2 agents.chloroquine, a well-known drug used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune disorders, has been previously shown to exhibit antiviral activity against hiv, zika virus, and coronavirus [23,24,25]. under in vitro culture condition, chloroquine blocks viral infection by increasing the endosomal ph required for virus/cell fusion [26]. it also prevents terminal glycosylation of the ace2 receptor of the host cell, which is required for virus/cell fusion. chloroquine mediated block of virus replication and entry in the host cell have been reported for many other viruses, including borna disease virus, minute virus of mice, the avian leucosis virus, and hepatitis a virus [25,27]. these promising in vitro data suggested that chloroquine could be one of the promising drugs to treat covid-19. however, the lack of robust preclinical data and potential safety issues of this drug remained to be addressed. to date, multiple clinical trials of chloroquine have been conducted either as a standalone drug or in combination with other drugs with and without randomization and placebo controls [28]. while no significant effect of chloroquine on improvement in disease outcome could be ascertained in most of the studies, reports of adverse events have been observed in some cases including ventricular arrhythmias, qt prolongation, and other cardiac toxicity, indicating that this drug may pose risk to covid-19 patients if not given methodically and at the right dose [29,30]. interestingly, chloroquine is also known to affect immune system activity by mediating an anti-inflammatory response, which might reduce the pathology of covid-19 due to the exaggerated inflammatory response it triggers during the progression of the disease [31]. however, no studies have yet evaluated the use of chloroquine for prophylaxis against covid-19. future studies that can better elucidate the most effective dose, schedule of administration, and adverse events along with its prophylaxis effect on the disease will confirm whether it has any potential in controlling covid-19. the structure-based design of antiviral drug candidates 11a and 11b (aldehyde based indole-2-carboxamide compounds), which target the sars-cov-2 main protease, recently exhibited in vitro antiviral activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in vivo, suggesting that they may also be promising drug candidates [32]. while the in vivo pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies showed encouraging results for these two new compounds, their efficacy against viral infection still needs to be validated in vivo in an appropriate experimental infection model, before forwarding to clinical trials. a more detailed review of the clinical studies of many other pathogen-targeting drugs, including remdesivir and chloroquine, has been described in other recent reports [21,33].the high morbidity of sars-cov-2 patients is due to acute respiratory distress characterized by a cytokine storm that leads to increased plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines il-2, 7, 10, and 17; gm-csf; interferon-γ-inducible protein 10; mcp-1; macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha; and tnf-α [34]. tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 receptor, has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and promising clinical outcomes. tocilizumab can suppress cytokine storms, improve respiratory function, and normalize body temperature [35]. however, this is a single observation study with a limited number of covid-19 patients and hence may have a significant bias. covid-19 mortality has been found to be associated with myocarditis in the setting of ards, and a th17 type immune response has been reported to drive more severe viral myocarditis [36]. this suggests that anti-il-17 therapy could be another potential approach in managing the disease severity and decreasing the mortality related to covid-19-induced myocarditis.low-dose steroids such as prednisolone and tacrolimus have also been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines that exacerbate lung pathology [37]. given that pneumonia is secondary to a deleterious inflammatory process during covid-19 disease progression, the use of prednisolone and/tacrolimus for severe covid-19 lung injury patients thus could have a positive clinical effect. clinical trials are already underway to evaluate the efficacy of these two immunosuppressive drugs in decreasing the secondary pathological manifestation of lung pneumonia in covid-19 patients (nct04341038). another host-directed approach is to target the ace/ace receptor and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) of the host cell to reduce the chances of infection. hypertension drugs, lisinopril (ace inhibitor), and losartan (angiotensin ii receptor-blocker, arbs) can increase the expression of ace2 receptors, which may exacerbate viral load in cells [38]. however, some studies suggest that ace inhibitors and arbs could benefit patients with covid-19 since ace2 converts angiotensin ii to angiotensin, which may have beneficial vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties. though the usefulness of ace inhibitors or arbs is uncertain and based on retrospective cohort studies, arb was recently approved for clinical trials to evaluate its potential for the treatment of covid-19 patients [13,39]. another alternative approach is to use recombinant human ace2, as the virus may more readily bind to the soluble ace2 in comparison to ace2 receptors on the cell surface. this approach of preventing virus entry in the cells has shown promising preclinical results leading to its transition into clinical trials already [13,39]. camostat mesilate is another potential candidate drug that is being considered as a host-directed therapy for covid-19 patients. camostat mesilate, which is used primarily for treating postoperative reflux esophagitis and for acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis, could block spread and pathogenesis of sars-cov in a pathogenic mouse model. it is known to inhibit the host serine protease tmprss2, which primes the spike protein of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses [40], and since sars-cov-2 is also dependent on host tmprss2 [13], it is a viable target for host-directed therapies. based on more than 15 years of safe clinical track record in japan and efficacy against sars-cov in preclinical studies, a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial for repurposing this drug for covid-19 is already in progress (nct04353284).convalescent plasma (cp) is passive immunotherapy that has been used to improve the survival rate of patients with infectious diseases for over a century [55]. cp administration reduced mortality rates and shortened hospital stays in patients with sars [56]. various studies demonstrate that severely ill covid-19 patients treated with cp showed a lower mortality rate compared to untreated controls [57]. a new study reported that critically ill covid-19 patients (n = 10) treated with cp transfusion demonstrated significantly increased levels of neutralizing antibodies and depletion of viral load in 7 days. clinical symptoms and paraclinical criteria in these patients improved within 3 days [58]. placebo-controlled clinical trials to test cp therapy are ongoing in china (nct04264858), and larger studies also started in the usa (houston methodist hospital, houston, texas; mount sinai medical center, new york, new york, etc.), after it was approved by the us food and drug administration for covid-19 treatment [59,60]. cp from covid-19-recovered patients is used to treat patients infected with sars-cov-2. the sars-cov-2-specific igg antibodies received from sars-cov-2-recovered patients are passively transferred via transfused plasma and may neutralize viral particles and stimulate the complement system to encourage viral elimination [61]. while the results from some of the more recent clinical trials are encouraging [62,63], validation of these results from large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials is needed to further establish the effectiveness of cp therapy. cp dose and frequency are two of the criteria that may require more optimization to further improve the efficacy of cp therapy for covid-19. moreover, with regard to selecting the cp donor, the adequate titer of igg and neutralization antibodies should be standardized and a robust donation program needs to be in place to make cp therapy a more viable treatment option for covid-19. early intervention, at the onset of symptoms, should also be considered as an important factor in enhancing the success rate of cp therapy for the treatment of covid-19 patients. this is based on the observation that a better treatment outcome was achieved in sars patients who were given cp before 14 days post infection, thus underlining the significance of early time administration of this therapy. transfusion-related acute lung injury and infection enhancement that could occur due to subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies could be some of the major drawbacks of cp if these are not considered during the course of treatment. relationship between sars-cov-2 rna reduction and cp therapy, the optimal concentration of neutralizing antibodies required for effective treatment, and dynamic changes of different cytokine during treatment are some of the key parameters that, once defined, can further narrow the gap that exists for this therapeutic option. cell-based therapies, particularly stem cell therapies, have become a promising therapeutic approach to treat various diseases for which treatment has proven difficult. a few decades ago, researchers made the important observation that stem cells, including pluripotent/multipotent cells, were resistant to viral infection due to the expression of specific genes such as interferon-gamma-stimulated genes [64]. for example, there is direct evidence of stem cell protection against infection from myxoma virus, a therapeutic oncolytic poxvirus. hematopoietic stem cells can contain the myxoma virus infection, while other cells, such as differentiated human monocytes, b-cells, and natural killer cells, cannot [65]. recently, the usa, china, and several other countries have started stem cell therapy-based clinical trials to treat sars-cov-2 infection (table 2). even with the significant progress of stem cell-based approaches, limited cell sources, immunogenicity, and ethical issues remain some of the major limitations. mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) have received attention due to their source potential, low invasive acquisition procedure, high proliferation rate, and lack of ethical concern. mscs can be isolated from several tissues (e.g., adipose tissue, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood, dental pulp, menstrual blood, wharton jelly, buccal fat pad, and fetal liver) and can be stored for future treatment. they are easily expanded to clinical volume in a short amount of time, and their safety and efficacy have been thoroughly documented in many clinical trials [66,67,68]. while multiple clinical trials for the use of mscs to treat various diseases are ongoing, so far none of them have been yet proposed for covid-19 treatment.a 2016 study investigated the effect of mscs therapy on influenza virus a/h5n1-infected mice and found that human mscs reduced influenza virus a/h5n1-induced acute lung injury and increased overall survival [69]. notably, during sars-cov-2 infections, the host immune system increases the production of inflammatory factors, inducing a cytokine storm that results in excessive production of immune cells and cytokines [34]. mscs therapy may inhibit this release of proinflammatory cytokines and, owing to the regenerative properties of stem cells, they may also improve endogenous repair of injured tissues (figure 2). mscs secrete multiple growth factors (vegf, pdfg, fgf, tgf-β, etc.) that regulate endothelial and epithelial permeability, suppress inflammation, and enhance tissue repair/regeneration [66]. recent studies on stem cells’ ability to alleviate lung fibrosis has also been reported, which is a critical pathological factor in covid-19 [70]. at the same time, mscs are also known to exhibit strong antimicrobial effects through the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and proteins (ll-37, defensins, hepcidin, and lipocalins), which could benefit in reducing the viral loads as well during the progression of covid-19 [71,72]. thus, after the intravenous infusion of mscs, a significant population of mscs would naturally live in the lung, where they could cure covid-19 via protecting alveolar epithelial cells, reclaiming the pulmonary microenvironment, preventing pulmonary fibrosis, and salvaging lung dysfunction. these hypotheses spurred the pursuit of mscs therapy for sars-cov-2 patients. a recent study demonstrated that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mscs in seven severe covid-19 patients resulted in improved functional outcomes with observable adverse effects [73]. the clinical benefit of mscs should thus now be evaluated in a larger cohort of patients in the future. moreover, the benefit of genetically engineered modified mscs should also be assessed in covid-19 patients. genetically engineered modified mscs have been used to treat several diseases, such as cancer, myocardial infarction, and acute liver failure. mscs modifications include over-expression of cytokines, chemically engineered mscs, physical preconditioning, or pharmacological preconditioning [74]. one important limitation of this approach is a dependency on stem cell banks for clinical-grade mscs and limited speed of preparation.scientific teams have now also begun investigating the prospects of car-t-based immunotherapy for treating covid-19. car-t therapy represents an incredibly promising approach to reprograming t cells by expressing a synthetic receptor directed against the specific antigen to eliminate the virus-infected cells or cancer cells to control the disease progression [75]. car-t therapy has already revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, especially for the treatment of b cell malignancies [76,77]. apart from their treatment potential against b-cell malignancies, car-t therapies have also shown early encouraging results for chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection, hiv, and hbv-related hepatocellular carcinoma in recent studies [78,79]. the success of car-t therapy against some of these viral infections accentuates their immense potential against other infectious diseases as well, since pathogen-specific t cells play a pivotal role in controlling infections. this therapy involves the extraction of t cells from the patient/healthy donor’s bloodstream, and, after harvesting and expanding the t cells, they are reprogrammed to express a chimeric antigen receptor (car) targeting virus-infected cells (figure 3). while the therapy could be cost-prohibitive for treating most types of viral infections, it could be a viable option for covid-19 since no other definitive treatment option is available for this disease yet. it has been indeed demonstrated that car-t cells can be redirected to target the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) [80]. these engineered t cells for sars-cov-specific antigen exhibited a functional profile comparable to that of sars-specific memory cd8 t cells recovered from sars-cov-infected patients. this initial evidence suggested that car-t cells could thus be pursued for treatment for sars-cov-2. nonetheless, the adoption of car-t therapy for clinical application against covid-19 will require managing certain technical obstacles. one of the caveats is that car-t cells that stably express pathogen-specific t cell receptors could pose a risk of its proliferation and mediated excessive killing of infected cells, which could result in excessive inflammation and tissue injury. to overcome this problem, engineering of car-t cells could be done through mrna electroporation, rather than using viral transduction, to obtain virus-specific t cells that will survive only for a limited time (figure 3). the use of mrna electroporation has been shown to result in only transient expression (3–5 days) of the car and thus is expected to decrease the risk for its off-target effects [81]. this technological adaptation can also reduce the viral contamination that can come from the viral transduction method of conventional car-t cell engineering. transient car-t cells could also overcome the common cytotoxicity due to cytokine storm that has been observed after conventional car-t therapy. cytokine storm has been one of the pathological manifestations observed in severely ill covid-19 patients, which leads to increased lung inflammation. if lymphocytes are engineered using the transient mrna transfection approach that keeps them active for a limited amount of time, this will likely minimize the potential of cytokine-storm-mediated cytotoxic effects. in this context, the dosing regimen and timing of administration of car-t cells should also be carefully assessed to rule out its possible cytotoxic effect for covid-19 treatment.unarguably, the best long-term strategy to curb the scale of the humanitarian and economic impact of the covid-19 pandemic is to develop an effective vaccine that can prevent the new infections and stop the transmission of the disease. the scientific community and the vaccine industry have responded urgently to this epidemic of sars-cov-2 to support the development of vaccines against covid-19. the demand of the situation and the availability of multiple vaccine technology platforms has also accelerated the development of many candidate covid-19 vaccines at unprecedented rapidity, and some of these candidates have already entered human clinical testing. the pipeline of vaccines against covid-19 has already reached more than 100 confirmed active candidate vaccines, though most of them are at exploratory or preclinical stages. as of june 4, 2020, 10 candidate vaccines that have made it to clinical stage represent diverse platforms including mrna, dna, adenoviral/lentiviral/bacterial vector-based vaccines, and inactivated sars-cov-2 [82]. dna and mrna-based platforms offer the advantage of flexibility in terms of antigen manipulation and manufacturing speed. dna and mrna vaccines allow changing the antigen coding gene sequence in order to address the frequent mutations in the antigenic epitopes [83]. by comparing the genetic similarity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov, a set of sars-cov-derived b cell and t cell epitopes that exactly match sars-cov-2 have also been identified recently [84]. as no mutations have been observed in the identified epitopes among the available sars-cov-2 genetic sequences, immune targeting of these epitopes for future vaccine candidates can also counteract the issue of genetic variations of the target antigen. currently, there are no licensed dna/mrna vaccines for use in humans, but a few vaccines developed on these platforms have demonstrated potent immunity against various infectious disease targets and cancer in experimental animal models [85]. while enhanced delivery technologies, such as electroporation and liposomes, have increased the efficacy of dna vaccines in humans, a shift towards rna vaccine is clearly seen in the recent past. non-infectious, nonintegrating, natural degradation, egg, and cell-free safety are some of the major safety advantages for mrna vaccines over vector-based or dna vaccines [86]. mrna vaccines have also been found to stimulate a much broader range of innate and adaptive immune responses, which is desired against covid-19. phase 2 clinical trials investigating an mrna vaccine (sars-cov-2 mrna-1273) developed by moderna have begun, and phase 3 trials are scheduled to begin soon [87]. adenoviral (ad) vector vaccines also represent a promising modern vaccine platform, as a variety of ad vector vaccines have reached human clinical trials for infectious disease and cancer [88]. since first-generation adenovirus platforms (ad5) have the disadvantage of induction of adenovirus neutralizing antibodies, a second-generation adenovirus vaccine platform with four deletions enabling multiple homologous doses is being used to develop covid-19 vaccine [89,90]. specific targeting of an adenovirus to dendritic cells has been found to be very critical for the efficacy of the ad vector-based vaccine [91]. the replication-deficient feature of ad vector vaccines is its key biologic property, and they have had an excellent safety profile in clinical translation so far. ad vector vaccines can also be easily grown to high titer in cell culture, thereby facilitating their manufacture, regulatory approval, and clinical translation in a rapid manner [92]. apart from that, the ad vector vaccine also allows for the insertion of multiple transgenes, including not only the antigen of interest but also other genes that can enhance the response to vaccination. cansino biologics and the academy of military medical sciences (china) have developed a nonreplicating adenovirus serotype 5 (ad5) vector carrying the gene for the sars-cov-2 spike protein, and clinical trials are underway in wuhan, china [87,93]. at the university of oxford, uk, phase 1/2 clinical trials using a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine (chadox1) carrying the gene for the sars-cov-2 protein are underway [3].dendritic cells/antigen-presenting cells modified with the lentiviral vector, which expresses viral proteins and immune-modulatory genes, is also a new vaccine platform being evaluated in clinical trials currently for covid-19 (nct04276896). under this platform, dcs/apcs carrying a synthetic minigene of the viral structural proteins and a polyprotein protease of sars-cov-2 within the lentiviral vector is administered together with antigen-specific cytotoxic t cells. while there are fewer preclinical data and public information available about this platform, phase i and ii clinical trials are already underway to evaluate the anti-covid-19 efficacy of these to lentiviral-based cell vaccines, and we can expect to see the results of these trials soon.some studies also suggest that vaccines for other diseases may confer resistance to sars-cov-2. two recent reports suggested a correlation between bacille calmette-guérin (bcg; antituberculosis)-vaccinated countries and reduced mortality in covid-19 patients [94,95]. bcg is known to provide nonspecific protective effects through boosting innate immunity to treat malignancies such as bladder cancer, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia. specifically, bcg may augment the first line of immune defense (so-called “trained immunity”) to provide a better defense against bacterial, parasitic, and viral infection [96]. clinical trials in the netherlands led by dr. mihai g. netea [97] (nct04328441), and in australia, led by dr. nigel curtis (nct04327206), investigating the protection of bcg vaccines against the sars-cov-2 virus are ongoing. some of the recombinant bcg candidate vaccines that have shown a better protection profile in early preclinical and clinical studies could be other potential candidates to explore for covid-19 [98,99,100].moreover, since the immunity of the bcg vaccine is not known to last more than 10–15 years, revaccination of adults with bcg or recombinant bcg strains is another viable approach to consider, especially in countries where bcg is given at birth. we have curated the list of other vaccine candidates against sars-cov-2 from multiple journal sources that have recently moved into clinical trials, as mentioned in table 3 [3,11,93].in summary, drug repurposing, plasma and stem cell therapies, and vaccines are pharmaceutical interventions that are being actively explored to limit the transmission of sars-cov-2 infection. an early clinical priority is to contain the spread of the infection via diagnostics that detect sars-cov-2 infection rapidly and accurately. a vaccine or drug that prevents future infections is another early priority. there are few potential sars-cov-2 drug and vaccine candidates for clinical trials in the pipeline globally. however, all promising treatment strategies should be investigated for efficacy and safety moving forward.in december 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia surfaced in wuhan, china. the culprit was quickly identified as a beta-coronavirus that has never been reported before, and the virus was named by who as sars-cov-2 [1, 2] . by march 26, 2020, more than 80,000 people in china had been confirmed to be infected with the pathogen, and among them, 3293 people died from the infection. under the aggressive control measures implemented by the chinese government, the severe domestic epidemic seems to have been effectively contained. however, a global outbreak has caused more than 460,000 confirmed cases in more than 190 other countries, making the sars-cov-2 pandemic a general public health event that has stirred up worldwide attention.sars-cov-2 is a positive-strand rna virus that belongs to the group of betacoronaviruses. the genome of sars-cov-2 is approximately 29,700 nucleotides long and shares 79.5% sequence identity with sars-cov [3] , it has a long orf1ab polyprotein at the 5 end, which encode 15 or 16 non-structural proteins. the 3 end of the genome encodes 4 major structural proteins, including the spike (s) protein, nucleocapsid (n) protein, membrane (m) protein, and the envelope (e) protein [4] , as shown in figure 1 . sars-cov-2 binds to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) on host cell for the virus entry and subsequent pathogenesis [5] , resulting in severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and severe cases can be fatal [6] . vaccines are the most effective and economical means to prevent and control infectious diseases [7] . the development of an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 infection is urgently required. so far, more than 40 pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions worldwide have launched their programs on vaccine development against sars-cov-2. herein, we will summarize the recent progress on this vaccine development worldwide, in particular, on candidate antigens, adjuvants, evaluation models, and technologies used in related research.the whole cell antigens (wca) contain all the elements of the virus, including proteins, lipids, polysaccharide, nucleic acids, and some other components. wca has been used for developing whole-cell killed and live-attenuated vaccines [8, 9] . given the complex compositions of wca, it is unavoidable to face more difficulties in quality control and consistency evaluation. so far, several institutions have successfully isolated the virus strains of sars-cov-2 and started whole-cell killed or live-attenuated vaccine development. however, research on the type of vaccine requires stringent screening for obtaining strains with assured low or no pathogenicity [10] .s protein is currently the most promising antigen formulation for sars-cov-2 vaccine research. first, it is surface exposure and thus is able to be directly recognized by host immune system [11] . second, it mediates the interaction with host cell by binding to the receptor ace2, which is essential for subsequent virus entry to target cells and causing subsequent pathogenicity [11, 12] . finally, the homologue proteins were already used for vaccine development against sars-cov and mers-cov, and were proved to be effective [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .the monomer of s protein from sars-cov-2 contains 1273 amino acids, with a molecular weight of about 140 kda. self-association naturally assembles the s protein into a homo-trimer, typically similar to the first class of membrane fusion protein (class i viral fusion protein). the s protein contains two subunits (s1 and s2). the s1 subunit can be further defined with two domains termed the n-terminal domain (ntd) and the c-terminal domain (ctd). the receptor binding domain (rbd) is located in the ctd. s2 subunit contains the basic elements required for membrane fusion, vaccines are the most effective and economical means to prevent and control infectious diseases [7] . the development of an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 infection is urgently required. so far, more than 40 pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions worldwide have launched their programs on vaccine development against sars-cov-2. herein, we will summarize the recent progress on this vaccine development worldwide, in particular, on candidate antigens, adjuvants, evaluation models, and technologies used in related research.the whole cell antigens (wca) contain all the elements of the virus, including

whole-cell killed or live-attenuated vaccine development. however, research on the type of vaccine requires stringent screening for obtaining strains with assured low or no pathogenicity [10] .s protein is currently the most promising antigen formulation for sars-cov-2 vaccine research. first, it is surface exposure and thus is able to be directly recognized by host immune system [11] . second, it mediates the interaction with host cell by binding to the receptor ace2, which is essential for subsequent virus entry to target cells and causing subsequent pathogenicity [11, 12] . finally, the homologue proteins were already used for vaccine development against sars-cov and mers-cov, and were proved to be effective [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .the monomer of s protein from sars-cov-2 contains 1273 amino acids, with a molecular weight of about 140 kda. self-association naturally assembles the s protein into a homo-trimer, typically similar to the first class of membrane fusion protein (class i viral fusion protein). the s protein contains two subunits (s1 and s2). the s1 subunit can be further defined with two domains termed the n-terminal domain (ntd) and the c-terminal domain (ctd). the receptor binding domain (rbd) is located in the ctd. s2 subunit contains the basic elements required for membrane fusion, including an internal membrane fusion peptide (fp), two 7-peptide repeats (hr), a membrane proximal external region (mper), and a trans-membrane domain (tm) [18] . recently, the structure of the sars-cov-2 s trimer in the pre-fusion conformation and the rbd domain in complex with ace2 has been successfully determined [11, 12] , which has provided valuable information for vaccine design based on this protein. so far, the potential fragments of s protein for use as antigens in vaccine development include the full-length s protein, the rbd domain, the s1 subunit, ntd, and fp.full-length proteins are likely to maintain the correct conformation of the protein, capable of providing more epitopes and exhibiting higher immunogenicity. pallesen et al. [19] demonstrated that higher titer of neutralizing antibodies in balb/c mice immunized with recombinant prefusion mers-cov s protein. another research confirmed that s protein produced in baculovirus insect cells was able to assemble into nanoparticles. mice immunized with these nanoparticles formulated with alum adjuvant that produced high titer of neutralizing antibodies [20] . muthumani et al. [21] reported that dna vaccine encoding mers-cov s protein was immunogenic in mice, camels, and rhesus macaques. animals immunized with the dna vaccine show reduced typical clinical symptoms including pneumonia during the infection. so far, clover biopharmaceuticals had announced that they have constructed a sars-cov-2 s protein trimer vaccine (s-trimer) by using its patented trimer-tag© technology, and this vaccine will be produced via a rapid mammalian cell-culture based expression system, further preclinical safety and analysis will be launched within the next 6-8 weeks.since the rbd of s protein directly interacts with the ace2 receptor on host cells, rbd immunization induced specific antibodies may block this recognition and thus effectively prevent the invasion of the virus. as a matter of fact, most of sars-cov-2 subunit vaccines currently under development use rbd as the antigen. moreover, the rbd domain was also used in the development of sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines. for example, studies have demonstrated that recombinant rbd consists of multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes that can induce high titer of neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov [22] . lan et al. [23] reported that rhesus macaques immunized with the recombinant rbd formulated with alum adjuvant could produce neutralizing antibodies, in association with observed mitigation of the clinical symptoms during mers-cov infection. nyon et al. [24] also reported that hcd26/dpp4 transgenic mice immunized with rbd fused to fc elicited neutralizing antibodies and were capable of protecting mers-cov infection. further, rbd domain is relatively conserved as compared with s1 subunit and was reported to contain multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes [25] , making it more suitable for vaccine development.similar to rbd, the n-terminal domains (ntd) of s protein from several coronaviruses were reported to show carbohydrate receptor-binding activity. for example, the ntd of spike protein form transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) was reported to bind sialic acid via ntd [26] . the carbohydrate-binding properties of ibv m41 strain are also related to the ntd of the s protein [27] . thus, this domain is also a candidate antigen for vaccine development. one study reported that rntd of s protein from mers-cov induced potent cellular immunity and antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and was protective against the viral challenge [28] . there is a report that a mab that binds to the n-terminal domain (ntd) of the mers-cov s1 subunit showed efficient neutralizing activity against the wild-type mers-cov strain emc/2012 [29] , this result showed that ntd specific antibodies are functional in neutralization. however, as the genomes of coronaviruses are highly variable, it is better to use antibodies targeting different epitopes to avoid immune escape of the virus.although the function of s1-ntd of sars-cov-2 has not been elucidated, it may also be involved in the binding of certain receptors and can also serve as a candidate antigen.the s1 subunit, which contains both rbd and ntd described above, is mainly involved in the s protein binding to the host receptor. it is also widely used in vaccine development. wang et al. [30] reported that mers-cov s1 protein formulated with mf59 adjuvant protected hdpp4 transgenic mice against lethal virus challenge, and the protection correlated well with the neutralizing antibody titer. adney et al. [31] confirmed that immunization with adjuvanted s1 protein reduced and delayed virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels and complete protection was observed in alpaca against mers-cov challenge.the fp domain of the s2 subunit is involved in the membrane fusion of the virus, which is also a key step in viral pathogenicity [32] . therefore, it may also serve as a vaccine candidate antigen. at present, tianjin university has constructed an rbd-fp fusion protein, and high titer of antibodies was detected in mice immunized with this fusion protein, and the efficacy is under evaluation.the n protein is the most abundant protein in coronavirus, and it is normally highly conserved, with a molecular weight of about 50 kda. n protein has multiple functions including formation of nucleocapsids, signal transduction virus budding, rna replication, and mrna transcription [33] . this protein was reported to be highly antigenic, 89% of patients who developed sars, produced antibodies to this antigen [34] . dna vaccine encoding sars-cov n protein generated strong n-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated c57bl/6 mice, and was capable of significantly reducing the titer of challenging vaccinia virus [35] . meanwhile, some other researchers reported that the n protein of avian infectious bronchitis virus is associated with the induction of ctls that correlated with a decrease in clinical signs and viral clearance from lungs, suggesting cellular response is essential in n protein mediated protection [36, 37] . in contrast, another research indicated that the n protein immunization did not make a significant contribution to a neutralizing antibody response and provided no protection to infection in hamsters [38] . these results suggest that there is controversy about whether this protein could be used for vaccine development. anyhow, there is no doubt that it can be used as a marker in diagnostic assays due to its high immunogenicity.m protein is a trans-membrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 25 kda and is involved in virus assembly, and this protein is the most abundant protein on the surface of sars-cov [39] . it was reported that immunization with the full length of m protein is able to elicit efficient neutralizing antibodies in sars patients [40] . immunogenic and structural analysis also indicated that the trans-membrane domain of the m protein contains a t cell epitope cluster that is able to induce a strong cellular immune response [41] . m protein is also highly conserved in evolution among different species [39] , therefore it may be used as a candidate antigen for developing sars-cov-2 vaccine.compared with s, n, and m protein, e protein is not suitable for use as an immunogen. for one reason, it consists of 76-109 amino acids in different coronaviruses with channel activity, thus the immunogenicity is limited. studies have shown that sars-cov e protein is an important virulence factor, and the secretion of inflammatory factors il-1β, tnf, and il-6 are significantly reduced after knocking out e protein [42] .whole-cell killed or live-attenuated vaccines present multiple antigenic components to the host and can thus potentially induce diverse immunologic effectors against pathogen [43] . they are traditional vaccines with mature preparatory technology, and may become the first sars-cov-2 vaccine put into clinical applications. currently, several research institutions have started related research. the chinese centers for disease control and prevention, wuhan institute of virology, chinese academy of sciences, zhejiang university, and several other institutions have successfully isolated the virus strains of sars-cov-2 and started relevant vaccine development. besides, codagenix, inc. announced the collaboration with the serum institute of india, ltd. to develop a live-attenuated vaccine against sars-cov-2. they use viral deoptimization to synthesize "rationally designed" live-attenuated vaccines. this technology starting with the sequence of the viral genome and allows for the rapid generation of multiple vaccine candidates against the virus.subunit vaccines include one or more antigens with strong immunogenicity capable of efficiently stimulating the host immune system. in general, this type of vaccine is safer and easier to produce, but often requires the addition of adjuvants to elicit a strong protective immune response. so far, several institutions have initiated programs on the sars-cov-2 subunit vaccine, and almost all of them use the s protein as antigens. for example, the university of queensland is developing a subunit vaccine based on the "molecular clamp" technology [44] . clover biopharmaceuticals inc. revealed that they are developing a vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2 using the "trimer-tag" technology [45] , and the trimeric s protein subunit vaccine candidate was produced via a mammalian cell expression system. novavax, inc. announced that they had produced multiple nanoparticle vaccine candidates based on s protein, and now is assessing efficacy in animal models to identify an optimal vaccine candidate for human testing. besides, johnson & johnson, pasteur institute, and chongqing zhifei biological products co., ltd. also started subunit vaccine development against sars-cov-2.with the development and maturing of mrna synthesis, modification, and delivery technology, the research on mrna vaccine has regained attention during the last two decades. mrna vaccines represent a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches because of their high potency, short production cycles, low-cost manufacturing, and safe administration [46] . the procedures of mrna vaccine development include the selection of antigens, the optimization of sequences, the screening of modified nucleotides, the optimization of delivery systems, the evaluation of immune response and safety test [47] . particularly, no mrna vaccine has yet entered the market, thus it may take more time in quality standards establishment and safety evaluation. so far, a sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine (mrna-1273, encoding s protein) developed by moderna, has been launched in animal experiments and clinical batch production. it is expected that clinical trials will be conducted on 20-25 healthy volunteers by the end of april. fudan university is in collaboration with shanghai jiaotong university and bluebird biopharmaceutical company to develop a sars-cov-2 mrna vaccine using two different strategies. the first is to use mrna to express the sars-cov-2 s protein and rbd domain, the efficacy of this vaccine is now under evaluation in mice. the second is the use of mrna to express virus-like particles in vivo. in addition, german biopharmaceutical company curevac ag, stermirna therapeutics, bdgene therapeutics, guanhao biotech, zy therapeutics inc., cansino biologics inc., baylor college of medicine, university of texas, tongji university also announced their progress on mrna vaccine development against sars-cov-2.dna vaccines are typically comprised of plasmid dna molecules that encode one or more antigens. they are superior to mrna vaccines in the formulations needed for stability and delivery efficiency, nevertheless they need to enter the nucleus that may bring in the risk of vctor integration and mutations in the host genome [48] . so far, two sars-cov-2 dna vaccines are under development. inovio pharmaceuticals developed a dna vaccine candidate termed ino-4800, which is in preclinical studies and will soon enter phase i clinical trials. applied dna sciences subsidiary, linearx, and takis biotech collaborated for the development of a linear dna vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2, which is now in preclinical studies.live vector vaccines are live viruses (the vector) that express a heterologous antigen(s). they are characterized by combining the strong immunogenicity of live attenuated vaccines and the safety of subunit vaccines, and were widely used to induce cellular immunity in vivo. related sars-cov-2 vaccine research has been carried out by the following institutions. houston-based greffex inc. has completed the construction of sars-cov-2 adenovirus vector vaccine with greffex vector platform and should have now moved to animal testing. tonix pharmaceuticals announced research to develop a potential sars-cov-2 vaccine based on horsepox virus (tnx-1800). johnson & johnson has adopted the advac ® adenoviral vector platform [49] for vaccine development.these vaccines contain only certain fragments of intact antigens and are usually prepared by chemical synthesis techniques. they are easier in preparation and quality control. however, the low molecular weight and structural complexity of these vaccines usually result in low immunogenicity, thus structural modifications, delivery systems, and adjuvants are additionally required in the formulation [50] . currently, researchers from hong kong university of science and technology screened a set of b and t cell epitopes from s and n proteins of sars-cov, these epitopes are highly conserved in sars-cov-2 and may help guide experimental efforts towards the development of sars-cov-2 vaccines [51] . generex biotechnology announced that they are working with third-party groups to generate peptide vaccines against pandemic viruses using the patented nugenerex immuno-oncology ii-key technology that uses synthetic peptides in mimic essential protein regions from a virus that is chemically linked to the 4-amino acid ii-key to ensure robust immune system activation.animal models are essential for preclinical evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines. sars-cov-2 is a new pathogen and few animal models are currently available. recently, one study used the hace2 transgenic mice infected with sars-cov-2 to study the pathogenicity of the virus. hace2 transgenic mice infected with sars-cov-2 resulted in weight loss and virus replication in lung tissue. the typical histopathology of interstitial pneumonia was observed and viral antigens were detected in the bronchial epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and alveolar epithelia. this mouse model may facilitate the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines against sars-cov-2 [52] . in addition, the institute of zoology of the chinese academy of sciences reported that they observed similar symptoms with human infections in primate macaques, including changes in viral load and computed tomography (ct) images of the lungs. the model has been validated and is about to be applied in drug screening and functional evaluation.the highly contagious and pathogenicity brings great difficulties for sars-cov-2-related research. virus-like particles (vlps) are multi-protein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of authentic native viruses but lack the viral genome [53] . they are safe and effective tolls that are widely used in studying the pathogenic mechanisms of virus infection, efficacy evaluation of drugs and vaccines, and drug delivery [54] . for example, the corresponding vlps have been already used to determine the neutralizing antibodies induced by sars-cov and h5n1 vaccines [55, 56] . in the absence of animal models, vlps provide an alternative way to evaluate the efficacy of sars-cov-2 vaccines.in addition to live attenuated vaccines and live vector vaccines, adjuvants are required to enhance the immune response in the development of other types of vaccines. in order to accelerate the development of a sars-cov-2 vaccine, the preferred adjuvant should be those have been widely used in other marketable vaccines, including (1) classic aluminum adjuvant, aluminum adjuvants enhances the immune response by facilitating phagocytosis and slowing the diffusion of antigens from the injection site. it can efficiently stimulate th2 immune response upon injection [57] . (2) mf59, mf59 is an oil-in-water emulsion composed of tween 80, sorbitol trioleate, and squalene, and it has already been used in flu vaccines in europe and the united states. the mechanism of mf59 is to create a transient immune environment at the injection site, then to recruit immune cells to induce antigen-specific immune responses [58] . (3) adjuvant system (as) series adjuvants, which are a series of adjuvants developed by glaxosmithkline (gsk), including as01, as02, as03, and as04. among them, as01 is a liposome adjuvant containing 3-o-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid a (mpl) and saponin qs-21 [59] , which has been used in malaria vaccines [60] . as02 is an oil-in-water emulsifier containing mpl and qs-21 [61] . as03 is an oil-in-water emulsifier containing alpha-tocopherol, squalene, and tween 80. it has been used in influenza vaccines [62] . as04 is an aluminum adjuvant containing mpl and has been used in a human papilloma virus vaccine and hepatitis b virus vaccine [63] . currently, gsk announced that they would make its established pandemic vaccine adjuvant platform technology available to enhance the development of an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2, and agreements have been reached with clover biopharmaceutical inc. and the university of queensland, australia.because adjuvants were able to regulate the type of immune response, the optimal adjuvant should be selected according to the design of the vaccine. in order to induce a more efficient immune response, a combination of different types of adjuvants could be applied to improve the immune efficacy.safety is the most important issue that should be taken into consideration during drug and vaccine development, and some scientists urge that we should not rush to deploy covid-19 vaccines and drugs without sufficient safety guarantees [64] . for example, although s protein is a promising candidate antigen for vaccine development, it also exhibits other biological activity besides receptor binding and membrane fusion. previous studies have demonstrated that full-length s protein can cause severe liver damage and may result in enhanced infection [14] , which was defined as antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) [65] , and this effect may be probably caused by s protein specific antibodies [66, 67] . further, there is report that the enhanced virulence mediated by the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain jhm, is associated with a glycine at residue 310 of the spike glycoprotein, and this mutation may contribute to the spreading within the central nervous system (cns) [68] . however, it is not clear which domains and key amino acids in s protein of sars-cov-2 are involved in liver damage. therefore, the full-length s protein may face safety issues when used as an antigen. to solve this problem, more basic research should be carried out on the structure and function of this protein, and mutants of key residues may be introduced in antigen design. recently, a phase i clinical trial was launched to assess the safety and immunogenicity of mrna-1273 developed by moderna (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct04283461). however, this type of vaccines has not been approved for use in human beings before, thus the safety is not guaranteed and more assessments should be carried out during clinical trials.we know very little about sars-cov-2. there are more questions than answers for the newly identified virus, including the etiology, epidemiology, structural basis, mechanism of pathogenesis, pathological immune response, etc. particularly, the cellular and humoral immune response of the host in response to the virus infection that are essential for vaccine design, remains unclear. all these aspects need to be addressed by basic research in the near future for successful vaccine development.recently, more and more countries and r&d institutions announced their program on vaccine development against sars-cov-2. however, vaccine development has its own rules, and a successful sars-cov-2 vaccine could not be achieved overnight. after vaccine design and preparation, it will undergo efficacy and safety evaluation, quality standard establishment before entering clinical trials. generally, three phases of clinical trials will be carried out to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the vaccine. typically, the development of novel vaccines generally takes 10-20 years, and the success rate is less than 10%, even for a vaccine that enters clinical trials. in the past 30 years, the us fda has approved a total of nearly 3,000 clinical trials on vaccine applications and less than 20 vaccines were approved for the market. although the development, manufacture, and marketing of vaccines are supervised by strict regulations, and for the sake of human health, we must lay a solid foundation and conduct research in accordance with these scientific laws.recently, there is report that 149 sites of mutations were identified across the genome of 103 sequenced strains of sars-cov-2, and the virus had evolved into two subtypes, termed l and s subtype. the study also indicated that the two subtypes showed great differences in geographical distribution, transmission ability, and severity of disease, which add more difficulties for vaccine design [69] .currently, clinical trials testing different drugs are ongoing and will possibly allow the identification of a potential drug to treat the disease associated to sars-cov-2, and the rapid development and application of a vaccine is a powerful means to prevent the global epidemic of covid-19. although vaccine development is slower than the spreading of the epidemic, it is still necessary and urgent. firstly, the epidemic is still spreading all over the world and more and more confirmed cases and identified, and the inflection point has not yet been reached yet. secondly, sars-cov-2 infection may become a flu-like seasonal disease and coexist with human beings for a long time [70] .it should be pointed out that sars-cov-2 was identified in no more than 3 months, related research on pathogenic characteristics and mechanisms of this novel coronavirus have just begun, and thus the data and information collected are also very limited and need to be continuously accumulated and documented. this review also provides the authors' own opinions, and we hope it could provide useful information for colleagues. the authors declare no conflict of interest.a new type of coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent underlying a respiratory syndrome that recently emerged in the middle east [1, 2] . the coronavirus study group of the international committee on taxonomy of viruses proposed a new name for this novel betacoronavirus: the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). several middle eastern countries have been affected by the emerging mers-cov epidemic, including jordan, qatar, oman, saudi arabia, and the united arab emirates. tunisia has reported three confirmed cases of human infection. france, italy, germany, the united kingdom, greece, the netherlands, and the usa have also reported cases directly or indirectly connected to the middle east. eight hundred and thirty-seven cases of mers-cov infection have been confirmed to date, including 291 deaths [3] . the rapid accumulation of information about the sequences [2] of mers-cov, its genome structure, and its proteins open exciting possibilities for the development of candidate vaccines.we and others recently provided evidence that dromedary camels are a reservoir of mers-cov virus [4] [5] [6] [7] . both mers-cov spike protein-binding antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies have been reported in dromedary camels from different regions, including qatar, saudi arabia, oman, and egypt. moreover, mers-cov in dromedary camels from a farm in qatar were linked to two virologically confirmed human cases of the infection in october 2013 [4] and about one in five human cases have been reported to be caused by exposure to animals [8, 9] . the full mers-cov genome isolated from a qatari dromedary camel is highly similar to the human england/qatar 1 virus isolated in 2012 and has efficiently http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.08.058 0264-410x/© 2014 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. been replicated in human cells using human dpp4 as entry receptor, providing further evidence for the zoonotic potential of dromedary mers-cov [10] . although, we cannot conclude whether the people were infected by camels or vice versa or if yet another source was responsible, increasing evidence indicates that camels represent an important link in human infections with mers-cov. intensive vaccine control and risk-reduction targeting dromedary camels might be effective in eliminating the virus from the human population.the coronavirus spike protein (s) is a class i fusion protein. cellular entry of the virus has been demonstrated to be mediated by the s protein through the receptor binding domain (rbd) in the n-terminal subunit (s1) and the fusion peptide in the cterminal subunit (s2) [11, 12] . for betacoronaviruses, the s protein has been shown to be the main antigenic component responsible for inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against infection in patients who had recovered from sars [13, 14] and response levels correlated well with disease outcomes [15, 16] . the s protein has therefore been selected as an important target for vaccine development [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . recent work shows that modified vaccinia virus ankara expressing the s protein of mers-cov elicits high titers of s-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice [22] .adenovirus 5 (ad5)-vectored candidate vaccines induce potent and protective immune responses against several pathogens in humans and a variety of animals [18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . although a trial of a candidate dna/rad5 hiv-1 preventive vaccine showed lack of efficacy [37] and the high prevalence of pre-existing anti-ad5 immunity may have been a major limitation [38] in humans, replication-defective adenovirus vaccines are among the most attractive vectors for veterinary vaccine development, given the relative speed and low cost of development and production. most adenoviruses infect their host through the airway epithelium and replicate in the mucosal tissues of the respiratory tracts [39] . because of their ability of to elicit mucosal immune responses, adenoviruses could be an attractive vector for inducing mers-cov-specific immunity in dromedary camels, the putative animal reservoir. interestingly, sera antibodies against adenovirus type 3 were detected in 1.3% of dromedaries in nigeria [34] and in 43 of 120 camels in egypt [35] . the occurrence of adenovirus type 3 respiratory infections in camels was studied in sudan and a 90% seroprevalence was detected [36] .here, we describe the development of recombinant type 5 adenoviral vector expressing, codon-optimized mers-s and mers-s1 (ad5.mers-s and ad5.mers-s1) as vaccine candidates and investigate their ability to induce neutralizing immune responses in mice. moreover, to demonstrate the feasibility of using of a human adenovirus 5 based vaccine in dromedary camels, we have evaluated the infectivity and the presence of anti-adenovirus 5-neutralizing antibodies in this animal species.the mers-s (genbank jx869059) gene was codon-optimized for optimal expression in mammalian cells using the upgene codon optimization algorithm [40] and synthesized (genscript). pad/mers-s was generated by subcloning the codon-optimized mers-s gene into the shuttle vector, padlox (genbank u62024), at sali/noti sites. the coding sequence for mers-s1 (amino acids 1 to 725 of full-length mers s, according to the genebank database) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the shuttle vector (fig. 1a) . subsequently, replication-defective human adenovirus serotype 5, designated as ad5.mers-s and ad5.mers-s1, were generated by loxp homologous recombination and purified and stored as described previously [26, 41, 42] .for detection of mers-s protein expression in a549 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line) infected with five multiplicity of infection (moi) of ad 5, ad5.mers-s, or ad5.mers-s1, cells were fixed with cold methanol 36 h following infection and were incubated with pooled mouse sera against adenoviral vaccines. after washing, the cells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (invitrogen) and the mers-s protein was visualized by avidin/biotin complex solution (vector).babl/c mice were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 1 × 10 11 viral particles (v.p.) of ad5.mers-s, ad5.mers-s1, or ad 5 control, respectively. three weeks after the primary immunization, mice were boosted intranasally (i.n.) with the same dose of the respective immunogens. for the immunization study, a protocol approved by the university of pittsburgh institutional animal care and use committee was followed.three weeks after prime immunization, pooled sera were obtained from all mice and screened for mers-s-specific antibodies using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (facs) analysis of human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells transfected with either pad/mers-s or pad control using lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen). after 24 h at 37 • c, cells were harvested, trypsinized, washed with phosphate buffered saline (pbs), and stained with mouse antiserum against ad5.mers-s, ad5.mers-s1, or ad 5 followed by a pe-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (jackson immuno research). data acquisition and analysis were performed using lsrii (bd) and flowjo (tree star) software.sera from the animals were collected every week and tested for s protein-specific igg1 and igg2a by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). briefly, a549 cells were infected with 10 moi of ad5.mers-s1. at six hours after infection, cells were washed three times with pbs, serum-free media was added, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. elisa plates were coated with this supernatant from a549 cells infected with ad5.mers-s1 overnight at 4 • c in carbonate coating buffer (ph 9.5) and then blocked with pbs containing 0.05% tween 20 (pbs-t) and 2% bovine serum albumin (bsa) for 1 h. mouse sera were diluted 1:50 for igg2a and 1:100 for igg1 elisa in pbs-t with 1% bsa and incubated for 2 h. after the plates were washed, biotin-conjugated igg1 and igg2a (1:1000, ebioscience) and avidin-horseradish peroxidase (hrp) (1:500, pharmingen) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h. the plates were washed three times and developed with 3,3 5,5 -tetramethylbenzidine, and the reaction was stopped with 1 m h 2 so 4 and absorbance at 450 nm was determined using an elisa reader (bio-tek instruments).stocks of mers-cov were produced by preparing a sixth passage of the mers-cov emc isolate on vero cells. cells were inoculated with virus in dulbecco's modified eagle medium (biowhittaker) supplemented with 1% serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. after inoculation, the cultures were incubated at 37 • c in a co 2 incubator and three days after inoculation, supernatant from vero cells was collected.we tested the mers-cov neutralization activity of sera derived from mice immunized with ad5.mers-s, ad5.mers-s1, or ad 5 vaccines. mouse sera were obtained from the retro-orbital plexus weekly for six weeks and tested for their ability to neutralize mers-cov (emc isolate). briefly, virus (200 pfu) was premixed 1:1 with serial dilutions of sera from animal groups prior to inoculation onto vero cells, and viral infection was monitored by the occurrence of a cytopathic effect at 72 h post-infection. virus neutralization titers (vnts) were determined as the highest serum dilutions that showed full protection against the cytopathic effect of mers-cov.we tested the adenovirus neutralization activity of sera from camels [4] and humans from qatar (healthy individuals). all procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines. briefly, adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (gfp) (400 pfu) was premixed 1:1 with serial dilutions of sera prior to inoculation onto a549 cells, and viral infection was monitored by the detection of gfp-positive cells after 48 h. vnts were determined as the highest serum dilution that showed a 50% reduction in the number of adenovirus-infected cells.freshly isolated camel or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were seeded at 1-2 × 10 6 cells/ml in a 24-well plate and incubated for 2 h at 37 • c. next, cells were infected with 10 9 v.p. of ad5.egfp/ml in complete medium and incubated for 24 h at 37 • c and 5% co 2 . adenovirus-infected cells were examined for enhanced gfp expression using an inverted fluorescent microscope (olympus) and the percentage of ad5.egfp-infected cells was analyzed by measurement of mean fluorescence signal on a facs (bd biosciences). egfp-expressing cells in the monocyte populations were analyzed by gating using flowjo software.the dromedary camel fibroblast cell line dubca (atcc ® crl-2276 tm ) cells were seeded at 3 × 10 5 cells/well in a 24-well plate and infected with 10 moi of ad5.egfp. at 24 h after infection, flow cytometry of cells was analyzed using lsrii and flowjo software.for statistical analysis, the one-way analysis of variance and tukey's test were performed using prism software (san diego, california, usa). results were considered statistically significant when the p value was <0.05. symbols *, **, ***, and **** are used to indicated the p values <0.05, <0.005, <0.001, <0.0001, respectively.e1/e3 deleted human type 5 adenoviral vector was used to insert the full-length s and extracellular domain s1 of the codonoptimized mers-s open reading frames to generate ad5.mers-s and ad5.mers-s1 adenoviral vectors (fig. 1a) .to detect mers s protein expression of recombinant adenoviral candidate vaccines, a549 cells were infected with ad 5, ad5.mers-s, or ad5.mers-s1 and incubated with pooled day 28 sera from ad.mers or control immunized mice. immunocytochemical analysis showed expression of mers s protein in a549 cells infected with either ad5.mers-s or ad5.mers-s1, while no expression was detected in the mock and ad 5-infected cells. these same sets of infected cells were not stained with pooled sera from mice immunized with ad 5 (data not shown). furthermore, cells transduced with ad5-encoding full-length mers-s showed a plaque-like structure, which may have resulted from syncytium formation due to mers full length s protein expression, while the soluble form of mers s1 protein, which was detected intracellularly (presumably before secretion), showed no syncytium formation (fig. 1b) .both the ad5.mers-s-and ad5.mers-s1-immunized mice developed mers-s-specific antibodies, measured as reactivity on a549 cells transfected with pad using flow cytometry, while no specific antibody response was detected in serum samples from control animals inoculated with ad 5 or with pre-immunized naïve mouse sera (fig. 2) . specific response was slightly higher in mice immunized with ad5.mers-s than in mice immunized with ad5.mers-s1 (76.9% vs. 65.9% positive cells). these data suggest that adenoviral vaccines expressing mers-s and mers-s1 were able to induce s-specific antibodies.sera from mice collected every week after i.n. boosting with 1 × 10 11 v.p. of ad5.mers-s, ad5.mers-s1, or control ad 5 respectively, were tested for s protein-specific igg2a and igg1 immunoglobulin isotypes, indicating a th1-or th2-like response, respectively, by elisa. both igg1 and igg2a were detected as soon as one week after the first immunization. the induction of mers-s-specific igg1 and igg2a antibodies were comparable between immunized groups. as shown in fig. 3a , more significantly different igg1 responses (th-2) were observed in the sera of mice vaccinated with ad5.mers-s1 (**p < 0.005 at week 2; ***p < 0.001 at weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6) than ad5.mers-s when compared with the sera of mice vaccinated with ad 5. in fact, igg1 levels in the sera of mice vaccinated with ad5.mers-s showed a less significant difference (*p < 0.05 at weeks 2, 3, and 4; **p < 0.005 at week 5 and 6). in contrast, a highly significant difference in igg2a response (th-1) was observed in the sera of mice vaccinated with both ad5.mers-s and ad5.mers-s1 (****p < 0.0001 at weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) (fig. 3b) . interestingly, mers-s induced an earlier igg2a response than mers-s1 (*p < 0.05 vs. no significance at week 1), with igg2a titers significantly higher at week 2 (p = 0.0005), but not after week 3. no mers-s or -s1 specific serum antibody responses could be detected within the seven week period in mice immunized with the control adenovirus, ad 5. these data indicate that ad5.mers-s and ad5.mers-s1 can induce both th1 and th2 immune responses.mouse sera were also tested for their ability to neutralize mers-cov (emc isolate). even a single immunization with adenoviral-based mers vaccines induced detectable levels of mers-cov-neutralizing antibodies in all animals tested. after week 3 of booster immunization, animals developed robust levels of neutralizing antibodies, while control animals inoculated with ad 5 did not (fig. 4) . in some mice immunized with ad5.mers-s1, the highest neutralizing titers were observed as compared to mice immunized with ad5.mers-s, although no significant differences between the groups were noted. this result might suggest that ad5.mers-s1 expressing secreted s proteins induced a stronger th2-polarized response, which led to a better antibody-mediated neutralizing activity when compared with ad5.mers-s (fig. 3a) . or mers-s1 gene encoding the soluble form (1-725) was designated, as shown in the diagram. the positions of the rbd (small dots) and transmembrane domain (stripes) are indicated and s is divided into two subdomains, s1 and s2, at position 751 [46] . the vector was used to generate recombinant replication-deficient adenoviruses by homologous recombination with the adenoviral genomic dna. (b) detection of the mers-s protein by immunocytochemical staining of a549 cells infected with ad5.mers-s or ad5.mers-s1 (5 moi) using sera from mice obtained at three weeks after the second ad5.mers-s1 boost. as a negative control, mock or ad 5-infected cells were treated the same. notably, one of the main limitations for the use of adenoviralbased vaccine in humans would be the presence of anti-adenoviral neutralizing immunity in a large percentage of camel populations. thus, to demonstrate the potential of the proposed use of the ad5.mers candidate vaccines to be deployed as a veterinary vaccine in dromedary camels, we evaluated the presence of anti-human adenovirus type 5 neutralizing antibodies in this species. as shown in fig. 5 , no neutralization was detected in 12 sera from dromedary camels, which is an encouraging first indication of the potential of this candidate vaccine for dromedary camels.to provide further evidence for the potential use of ad5.mers-s1 as a vaccine in dromedary camels, we determined the susceptibility of dromedary camel cells to be infected by the human adenovirus serotype 5. human or dromedary camel pbmc cells were transduced with recombinant adenovirus expressing egfp and evaluated by flow cytometry analysis for egfp expression. as shown in fig. 6 , both human as well as dromedary camel pbmcs were successfully infected with ad5.egfp. moreover, a large percentage of the dromedary camel fibroblast cell line, dubca, were infected by ad5.egfp, indicating that the human adenovirus type 5 can indeed efficiently infect camel cells (fig. 6e and f) . 3 . characterization of mers-s1-specific immune responses induced by adenoviral vector vaccines. balb/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with 1 × 10 11 viral particles of ad 5 (c), ad5.mers-s (s), or ad5.mers-s1 (s1), respectively, and boosted intranasally with the same amount of each virus three weeks later. mers-s1-specific igg1 (a) and igg2a (b) antibody levels were measured at the indicated time points by elisa. statically significant differences (tukey's test) are marked by bars and asterisks. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. , or ad5.mers-s1 (c), respectively, as described in fig. 3 . mers-covneutralizing titers (vnts) were measured every week after primary immunization using vero cells by determining the highest dilution inhibiting mers-cov infection by 100%. fig. 5 . presence of anti-adenovirus type 5-neutralizing immunity in dromedary camel sera. twelve human and 12 dromedary camel sera were tested for the presence of anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibodies using standard adenoviral neutralization assay.our results show that an adenoviral-based vaccine that expresses full-length or the s1 subunits of the s protein can induce mers-cov-specific neutralizing antibody responses in mice.it will be important to demonstrate whether dromedary camels vaccinated with these candidate vaccines or convalescing from mers-cov infection have similar responses and will be protected from mers-cov challenge, since this may indicate whether such vaccine-induced responses are indeed protective and future use of the ad5.mers-s vaccine as a veterinary vaccine in dromedary camels would be possible.previous studies have shown that rbds of sars-cov presenting in the s1 subunit strongly react with antisera from sars patients in the convalescent phase, and depletion of rbd-specific antibodies from sars patients results in significant elimination of the neutralizing activity [43] . the rbd is the main domain that induces neutralizing antibody and t-cell immune responses against sars-cov infection [44] . a truncated rbd of mers-cov s protein was recently reported to potently inhibit viral infection and induce strong neutralizing antibody responses [45, 46] . sars-cov s and s2, but neither s1 nor other structural proteins, can induce apoptosis in vero e6 cells [47, 48] and no histopathological changes were observed in various tissues of rats immunized with a recombinant adenovirus containing a truncated s1 fragment of the sars-cov [49] . in contrast, vaccination with recombinant modified mva expressing sars-cov s protein is associated with enhanced hepatitis after challenge with sars-cov [50, 51] and sars-cov has been shown to infect hepatocytes and cause hepatitis in some human cases [51] [52] [53] , raising concerns about the safety of a vaccine that contains the full-length sars-cov s protein. a causal relationship between the induction of hepatitis and the full-length nature of the s protein could not be conclusively demonstrated; it can be presumed that the s1 gene has less risk for spontaneous recombination with wild type virus following the generation of new virus types. thus, we believe that an s1-expressing mers-cov vaccine would be a preferable vaccine candidate format. however, an alternative s antigen format such as the entire s-ectodomain or the s rbd domain could be evaluated for comparison. since the capacity of our immunization strategy to protect from infection will require challenge tests in clinically relevant mers-cov disease animal models such as dromedary camels, establishment of such a model will also be important to exclude the potential for vaccine-induced immunopathology, as seen in the feline infectious peritonitis virus model [54, 55] . to this end, a mouse model for mers-cov infection that was generated by prior transduction of the animals with an adenoviral vector expressing the human host-cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hdpp4) was recently reported [56] .this mouse model will also be considered in the future for the evaluation of the protective efficacy of the adenovirus-based vaccines. while further investigations are necessary to evaluate the mucosal immunity and the ultimate protective efficacy of ad5.mers-s and ad5.mers-s1 in dromedary camels or the proper animal models, our results demonstrate that recombinant adenoviruses encoding mers-s antigens may be protective vaccine candidates with a safe profile. moreover, we have also investigated in the present study the infectivity of adenovirus type 5 of dromedary camel cells and the presence of anti-adenovirus type 5 neutralizing antibodies in a limited set of dromedary camel sera. altogether, the presented studies support further exploration of ad5.mers vaccines to target the animal reservoir, reducing the risk of human exposure to mers-cov.since mid-december 2019 and as of early february 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) originating from wuhan (hubei province, china) has infected over 25,000 laboratory-confirmed cases across 28 countries with about 500 deaths (a case-fatality rate of about 2%). more than 90% of the cases and deaths were in china [1] . based on the initial reported surge of cases in wuhan, the majority were males with a median age of 55 years and linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market [2] . most of the reported cases had similar symptoms at the onset of illness such as fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue. most cases developed pneumonia and some severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome [3] .the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), a betacoronavirus, forms a clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the orthocoronavirinae subfamily [4] . the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) are also betacoronaviruses that are zoonotic in origin and have been linked to potential fatal illness during the outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, respectively [5, 6] . based on current evidence, pathogenicity for 2019-ncov is about 3%, which is significantly lower than sars-cov (10%) and mers-cov (40%) [7] . however, 2019-ncov has potentially higher transmissibility (r 0 : 1.4-5.5) than both sars-cov (r 0 : 2-5) and mers-cov (r 0 : <1) [7] .with the possible expansion of 2019-ncov globally [8] and the declaration of the 2019-ncov outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization, there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics to detect, prevent and contain 2019-ncov promptly. there is however currently a lack of understanding of what is available in the early phase of 2019-ncov outbreak. the systematic review describes and assesses the potential rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for 2019-ncov, based in part on the developments for mers-cov and sars-cov.a systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (pubmed, embase and cochrane library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, therapeutic drugs and vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines.there were two independent reviewers each focusing on sars, mers, and 2019-ncov, respectively. a third independent reviewer was engaged to resolve any conflicting article of interest. we used the key words "sars", "coronavirus", "mers", "2019 novel coronavirus", "wuhan virus" to identify the diseases in the search strategy. the systematic searches for diagnosis, therapeutic drugs and vaccines were carried out independently and the key words "drug", "therapy", "vaccine", "diagnosis", "point of care testing" and "rapid diagnostic test" were used in conjunction with the disease key words for the respective searches.examples of search strings can be found in table s1 . we searched for randomized controlled trials (rcts) and validation trials (for diagnostics test) published in english, that measured (a) the sensitivity and/or specificity of a rapid diagnostic test or a point-of-care testing kit, (b) the impact of drug therapy or (c) vaccine efficacy against either of these diseases with no date restriction applied. for the 2019-ncov, we searched for all in vitro, animal, or human studies published in english between 1 december 2019 and 6 february 2020, on the same outcomes of interest. in addition, we reviewed the references of retrieved articles in order to identify additional studies or reports not retrieved by the initial searches. studies that examined the mechanisms of diagnostic tests, drug therapy or vaccine efficacy against sars, mers and 2019-ncov were excluded. a google search for 2019-ncov diagnostics (as of 6 february 2020; table s2 ) yielded five webpage links from government and international bodies with official information and guidelines (who, europe cdc, us cdc, us fda), three webpage links on diagnostic protocols and scientific commentaries, and five webpage links on market news and press releases. six protocols for diagnostics using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) from six countries were published on who's website [9] . google search for 2019-ncov vaccines yielded 19 relevant articles.with the emergence of 2019-ncov, real time rt-pcr remains the primary means for diagnosing the new virus strain among the many diagnostic platforms available ( [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] ; table s3 ). among the 16 diagnostics studies selected, one study discussed the use of rt-pcr in diagnosing patients with 2019-ncov [11] ( table 1 ). the period and type of specimen collected for rt-pcr play an important role in the diagnosis of 2019-ncov. it was found that the respiratory specimens were positive for the virus while serum was negative in the early period. it has also suggested that in the early days of illness, patients have high levels of virus despite the mild symptoms.apart from the commonly used rt-pcr in diagnosing mers-cov, four studies identified various diagnostic methods such as reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (rt-lamp), rt-insulated isothermal pcr (rt-iipcr) and a one-step rrt-pcr assay based on specific taqman probes. rt-lamp has similar sensitivity as real time rt-pcr. it is also highly specific and is used to detect mers-cov. it is comparable to the usual diagnostic tests and is rapid, simple and convenient. likewise, rt-iipcr and a one-step rrt-pcr assay have also shown similar sensitivity and high specificity for mer-cov. lastly, one study focused on the validation of the six commercial real rt-pcr kits, with high accuracy. although real time rt-pcr is a primary method for diagnosing mers-cov, high levels of pcr inhibition may hinder pcr sensitivity (table 1) .there are eleven studies that focus on sars-cov diagnostic testing (table 1) . these papers described diagnostic methods to detect the virus with the majority of them using molecular testing for diagnosis. comparison between the molecular test (i.e rt-pcr) and serological test (i.e., elisa) showed that the molecular test has better sensitivity and specificity. hence, enhancements to the current molecular test were conducted to improve the diagnosis. studies looked at using nested pcr to include a pre-amplification step or incorporating n gene as an additional sensitive molecular marker to improve on the sensitivity (table 1 ).in addition, there are seven potential rapid diagnostic kits (as of 24 january 2020; table 2 ) available on the market for 2019-ncov. six of these are only for research purposes. only one kit from beijing genome institute (bgi) is approved for use in the clinical setting for rapid diagnosis. most of the kits are for rt-pcr. there were two kits (bgi, china and veredus, singapore) with the capability to detect multiple pathogens using sequencing and microarray technologies, respectively. the limit of detection of the enhanced real-time pcr method was 10 2 -fold higher than the standard real-time pcr assay and 10 7 -fold higher than conventional pcr methods in the clinical aspect, the enhanced real-time pcr method was able to detect 6 cases of sars-cov positive samples that were not confirmed by any other assay [25] sars-cov was detected in 11 of 17 (65%) samples from sars patients from day 2 to day 9 of the illness but in none of the 10 samples from healthy controls [33] • the real time pcr has a threshold sensitivity of 10 genome equivalents per reaction and it has a good reproducibility with the inter-assay coefficients of variation of 1.73 to 2.72%. • 13 specimens from 6 patients were positive with viral load range from 362 to 36,240,000 genome equivalents/ml. the real-time rt-pcr reaction was more sensitive than the nested pcr reaction, as the detection limit for the nested pcr reaction was about 10 3 genome equivalents in the standard cdna control.[34]real-time reverse-transcription pcr (rrt-pcr); rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp); open reading frame 1a (orf1a); loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp); enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa); immunofluorescent assay (ifa); immunochromatographic test (ict); nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa). with the emergence of 2019-ncov, there are about 15 potential vaccine candidates in the pipeline globally (table 3 ), in which a wide range of technology (such as messenger rna, dna-based, nanoparticle, synthetic and modified virus-like particle) was applied. it will likely take about a year for most candidates to start phase 1 clinical trials except for those funded by coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi). however, the kit developed by the bgi have passed emergency approval procedure of the national medical products administration, and are currently used in clinical and surveillance centers of china [40] .of the total of 570 unique studies on 2019-ncov, sars cov or mers-cov vaccines screened, only four were eventually included in the review. most studies on sars and mers vaccines were excluded as they were performed in cell or animal models ( figure 1 ). the four studies included in this review were phase i clinical trials on sars or mers vaccines (table 4 ) [44] [45] [46] [47] . there were no studies of any population type (cell, animal, human) on the 2019-ncov at the point of screening. the published clinical trials were mostly done in united states except for one on the sars vaccine done in china [44] . all vaccine candidates for sars and mers were reported to be safe, well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants. in addition, we highlight six ongoing phase i clinical trials identified in the clinicaltrials.gov register ( [48, 49] ); table s4 [50] [51] [52] . these trials are all testing the safety and immunogenicity of their respective mers-cov vaccine candidates but were excluded as there are no results published yet. the trials are projected to complete in december 2020 (two studies in russia [50, 51] ) and december 2021 (in germany [52] ).existing literature search did not return any results on completed 2019-ncov trials at the time of writing. among 23 trials found from the systematic review (table 5) , there are nine clinical trials registered under the clinical trials registry (clinicaltrials.gov) for 2019-ncov therapeutics [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . of which five studies on hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir plus ritonavir and arbidol, mesenchymal stem cells, traditional chinese medicine and glucocorticoid therapy usage have commenced recruitment. the remaining four studies encompass investigation of antivirals, interferon atomization, darunavir and cobicistat, arbidol, and remdesivir usage for 2019-ncov patients (table 5) . seroconversion measured by s1-elisa occurred in 86% and 94% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively, and was maintained in 79% participants up to study end at week 60.neutralising antibodies were detected in 50% participants at one or more time points during the study, but only 3% maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. t-cell responses were detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses, respectively. there were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60.[47] molecules developed by the university scientists inhibit two coronavirus enzymes and prevent its replication. the discovered drug targets are said to be more than 95% similar to enzyme targets found on the sars virus. researchers note that identified drugs may not be available to address the ongoing outbreak but they hope to make it accessible for future outbreaks.[85]9the first affiliated hospital of guangzhou medical university "xue bi jing" (tcm) -chictr2000029381approved. recruitment of subjects has not started.[86] besides the six completed randomized controlled trials (rct) selected from the systematic review (table 6) , there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at sars therapeutics [92] . the studies found from clinicaltrials.gov have not been updated since 2013. while many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir or ribavirin only, there has yet to be well-designed clinical trials investigating their usage. three completed randomized controlled trials were conducted during the sars epidemic-3 in china, 1 in taiwan and 2 in hong kong [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . the studies respectively investigated antibiotic usage involving 190 participants, combination of western and chinese treatment vs. chinese treatment in 123 participants, integrative chinese and western treatment in 49 patients, usage of a specific chinese medicine in four participants and early use of corticosteroid in 16 participants. another notable study was an open non-randomized study investigating ribavirin/lopinavir/ritonavir usage in 152 participants [98] . one randomized controlled trial investigating integrative western and chinese treatment during the sars epidemic was excluded as it was a chinese article [94] .there is only one ongoing randomized controlled trial targeted at mers therapeutics [99] . it investigates the usage of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta 1b. likewise, many prospective and retrospective cohort studies conducted during the epidemic centered on usage of ribavirin with lopinavir/ritonavir/ribavirin, interferon, and convalescent plasma usage. to date, only one trial has been completed. one phase 1 clinical trial investigating the safety and tolerability of a fully human polyclonal igg immunoglobulin (sab-301) was found in available literature [46] . the trial conducted in the united states in 2017 demonstrated sab-301 to be safe and well-tolerated at single doses. another trial on mers therapeutics was found on clinicaltrials.gov-a phase 2/3 trial in the united states evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (pk), and immunogenicity on co-administered mers-cov antibodies regn3048 & regn3051 [100] . however, particularly in the respect of improving clinical symptoms, elevating quality of life, promoting immune function recovery, promoting absorption of pulmonary inflammation, reducing the dosage of cortisteroid and shortening the therapeutic course, treatment with integrative chinese and western medicine treatment had obvious superiority compared with using control treatment alone.[94] microneutralization titres also correlated to the sab-301 levels in serum.single infusions of sab-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants. [46] 4. discussionrapid diagnostics plays an important role in disease and outbreak management. the fast and accurate diagnosis of a specific viral infection enables prompt and accurate public health surveillance, prevention and control measures. local transmission and clusters can be prevented or delayed by isolation of laboratory-confirmed cases and their close contacts quarantined and monitored at home. rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] .laboratory diagnosis can be performed by: (a) detecting the genetic material of the virus, (b) detecting the antibodies that neutralize the viral particles of interest, (c) detecting the viral epitopes of interest with antibodies (serological testing), or (d) culture and isolation of viable virus particles.the key limitations of genetic material detection are the lack of knowledge of the presence of viable virus, the potential cross-reactivity with non-specific genetic regions and the short timeframe for accurate detection during the acute infection phase. the key limitations of serological testing is the need to collect paired serum samples (in the acute and convalescent phases) from cases under investigation for confirmation to eliminate potential cross-reactivity from non-specific antibodies from past exposure and/or infection by other coronaviruses. the limitation of virus culture and isolation is the long duration and the highly specialized skills required of the technicians to process the samples.where the biological samples are taken from also play a role in the sensitivity of these tests. for sars-cov and mers-cov, specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract such as sputum and tracheal aspirates have higher and more prolonged levels of viral rna because of the tropism of the virus. mers-cov viral loads are also higher for severe cases and have longer viral shedding compared to mild cases. although upper respiratory tract specimens such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs can be used, they have potentially lower viral loads and may have higher risk of false-negatives among the mild mers and sars cases [102, 103] , and likely among the 2019-ncov cases.the existing practices in detecting genetic material of coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov include (a) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), (b) real-time rt-pcr (rrt-pcr), (c) reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (rt-lamp) and (d) real-time rt-lamp [104] . nucleic amplification tests (naat) are usually preferred as in the case of mers-cov diagnosis as it has the highest sensitivity at the earliest time point in the acute phase of infection [102] . chinese health authorities have recently posted the full genome of 2019-ncov in the genbank and in gisaid portal to facilitate in the detection of the virus [11] . several laboratory assays have been developed to detect the novel coronavirus in wuhan, as highlighted in who's interim guidance on ncov laboratory testing of suspected cases. these include protocols from other countries such as thailand, japan and china [105] .the first validated diagnostic test was designed in germany. corman et al. had initially designed a candidate diagnostic rt-pcr assay based on the sars or sars-related coronavirus as it was suggested that circulating virus was sars-like. upon the release of the sequence, assays were selected based on the match against 2019-ncov upon inspection of the sequence alignment. two assays were used for the rna dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) gene and e gene where e gene assay acts as the first-line screening tool and rdrp gene assay as the confirmatory testing. all assays were highly sensitive and specific in that they did not cross-react with other coronavirus and also human clinical samples that contained respiratory viruses [11] .the hong kong university used two monoplex assays which were reactive with coronaviruses under the subgenus sarbecovirus (consisting of 2019-ncov, sars-cov and sars-like coronavirus). viral rna extracted from sars-cov can be used as the positive control for the suggested protocol assuming that sars has been eradicated. it is proposed that the n gene rt-pcr can be used as a screening assay while the orf1b assay acts as a confirmatory test. however, this protocol has only been evaluated with a panel of controls with the only positive control sars-cov rna. synthetic oligonucleotide positive control or 2019-ncov have yet to be tested [106] .the us cdc shared the protocol on the real time rt-pcr assay for the detection of the 2019-ncov with the primers and probes designed for the universal detection of sars-like coronavirus and the specific detection of 2019-ncov. however, the protocol has not been validated on other platforms or chemistries apart from the protocol described. there are some limitations for the assay. analysts engaged have to be trained and familiar with the testing procedure and result interpretation. false negative results may occur due to insufficient organisms in the specimen resulting from improper collection, transportation or handling. also, rna viruses may show substantial genetic variability. this could result in mismatch between the primer and probes with the target sequence which can diminish the assay performance or result in false negative results [107] . point-of-care test kit can potentially minimize these limitations, which should be highly prioritized for research and development in the next few months.serological testing such as elisa, iift and neutralization tests are effective in determining the extent of infection, including estimating asymptomatic and attack rate. compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods, serological testing detects antibodies and antigens. there would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset [108] . furthermore, studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load. hence, serological diagnoses are likely used when nucleic amplification tests (naat) are not available or accessible [102] .vaccines can prevent and protect against infection and disease occurrence when exposed to the specific pathogen of interest, especially in vulnerable populations who are more prone to severe outcomes. in the context of the current 2019-ncov outbreak, vaccines will help control and reduce disease transmission by creating herd immunity in addition to protecting healthy individuals from infection. this decreases the effective r0 value of the disease. nonetheless, there are social, clinical and economic hurdles for vaccine and vaccination programmes, including (a) the willingness of the public to undergo vaccination with a novel vaccine, (b) the side effects and severe adverse reactions of vaccination, (c) the potential difference and/or low efficacy of the vaccine in populations different from the clinical trials' populations and (d) the accessibility of the vaccines to a given population (including the cost and availability of the vaccine).vaccines against the 2019-ncov are currently in development and none are in testing (at the time of writing). on 23 january 2020, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) announced that they will fund vaccine development programmes with inovio, the university of queensland and moderna, inc respectively, with the aim to test the experimental vaccines clinically in 16 weeks (by june 2020). the vaccine candidates will be developed by the dna, recombinant and mrna vaccine platforms from these organizations [109] .based on the most recent mers-cov outbreak, there are already a number of vaccine candidates being developed but most are still in the preclinical testing stage. the vaccines in development include viral vector-based vaccine, dna vaccine, subunit vaccine, virus-like particles (vlps)-based vaccine, inactivated whole-virus (iwv) vaccine and live attenuated vaccine. the latest findings for these vaccines arebased on the review by yong et al. (2019) in august 2019 [110] . as of the date of reporting, there is only one published clinical study on the mers-cov vaccine by geneone life science & inovio pharmaceuticals [47] . there was one sars vaccine trial conducted by the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases. both phase i clinical trials reported positive results, but only one has announced plans to proceed to phase 2 trial [111] .due to the close genetic relatedness of sars-cov (79%) with 2019-ncov [112] , there may be potential cross-protective effect of using a safe sars-cov vaccine while awaiting the 2019-ncov vaccine. however, this would require small scale phase-by-phase implementation and close monitoring of vaccinees before any large scale implementation.apart from the timely diagnosis of cases, the achievement of favorable clinical outcomes depends on the timely treatment administered. ace2 has been reported to be the same cell entry receptor used by 2019-ncov to infect humans as sars-cov [113] . hence, clinical similarity between the two viruses is expected, particularly in severe cases. in addition, most of those who have died from mers-cov, sars-cov and 2019-ncov were advance in age and had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that compromised their immune systems [114] . coronaviruses have error-prone rna-dependent rna polymerases (rdrp), which result in frequent mutations and recombination events. this results in quasispecies diversity that is closely associated with adaptive evolution and the capacity to enhance viral-cell entry to cause disease over time in a specific population at-risk [115] . since ace2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, coronaviruses are likely to infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract and this may influence the type of therapeutics against 2019-ncov, similarly to sar-cov.however, in the years following two major coronavirus outbreaks sars-cov in 2003 and mers-cov in 2012, there remains no consensus on the optimal therapy for either disease [116, 117] . well-designed clinical trials that provide the gold standard for assessing the therapeutic measures are scarce. no coronavirus protease inhibitors have successfully completed a preclinical development program despite large efforts exploring sars-cov inhibitors. the bulk of potential therapeutic strategies remain in the experimental phase, with only a handful crossing the in vitro hurdle. stronger efforts are required in the research for treatment options for major coronaviruses given their pandemic potential. effective treatment options are essential to maximize the restoration of affected populations to good health following infections. clinical trials have commenced in china to identify effective treatments for 2019-ncov based on the treatment evidence from sars and mers. there is currently no effective specific antiviral with high-level evidence; any specific antiviral therapy should be provided in the context of a clinical study/trial. few treatments have shown real curative action against sars and mers and the literature generally describes isolated cases or small case series.many interferons from the three classes have been tested for their antiviral activities against sars-cov both in vitro and in animal models. interferon β has consistently been shown to be the most active, followed by interferon α. the use of corticosteroids with interferon alfacon-1 (synthetic interferon α) appeared to have improved oxygenation and faster resolution of chest radiograph abnormalities in observational studies with untreated controls. interferon has been used in multiple observational studies to treat sars-cov and mers-cov patients [116, 117] . interferons, with or without ribavirin, and lopinavir/ritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in china for 2019-ncov. this drug treatment appears to be the most advanced. timing of treatment is likely an important factor in effectiveness. a combination of ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir was used as a post-exposure prophylaxis in health care workers and may have reduced the risk of infection. ribavirin alone is unlikely to have substantial antiviral activities at clinically used dosages. hence, ribavirin with or without corticosteroids and with lopinavir and ritonavir are among the combinations employed. this was the most common agent reported in the available literature. its efficacy has been assessed in observational studies, retrospective case series, retrospective cohort study, a prospective observational study, a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial ranging from seven to 229 participants [117] . lopinavir/ritonavir (kaletra) was the earliest protease inhibitor combination introduced for the treatment of sars-cov. its efficacy was documented in several studies, causing notably lower incidence of adverse outcomes than with ribavirin alone. combined usage with ribavirin was also associated with lower incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, nosocomial infection and death, amongst other favorable outcomes. recent in vitro studies have shown another hiv protease inhibitor, nelfinavir, to have antiviral capacity against sars-cov, although it has yet to show favorable outcomes in animal studies [118] . remdesivir (gilead sciences, gs-5734) nucleoside analogue in vitro and in vivo data support gs-5734 development as a potential pan-coronavirus antiviral based on results against several coronaviruses (covs), including highly pathogenic covs and potentially emergent batcovs. the use of remdesivir may be a good candidate as an investigational treatment.improved mortality following receipt of convalescent plasma in various doses was consistently reported in several observational studies involving cases with severe acute respiratory infections (saris) of viral etiology. a significant reduction in the pooled odds of mortality following treatment of 0.25 compared to placebo or no therapy was observed [119] . studies were however at moderate to high risk of bias given their small sample sizes, allocation of treatment based on the physician's discretion, and the availability of plasma. factors like concomitant treatment may have also confounded the results. associations between convalescent plasma and hospital length of stay, viral antibody levels, and viral load respectively were similarly inconsistent across available literature. convalescent plasma, while promising, is likely not yet feasible, given the limited pool of potential donors and issues of scalability. monoclonal antibody treatment is progressing. sars-cov enters host cells through the binding of their spike (s) protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) and cd209l [118] . human monoclonal antibodies to the s protein have been shown to significantly reduce the severity of lung pathology in non-human primates following mers-cov infection [120] . such neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by active or passive immunization using vaccines or convalescent plasma respectively. while such neutralizing antibodies can theoretically be harvested from individuals immunized with vaccines, there is uncertainty over the achievement of therapeutic levels of antibodies.other therapeutic agents have also been reported. a known antimalarial agent, chloroquine, elicits antiviral effects against multiple viruses including hiv type 1, hepatitis b and hcov-229e. chloroquine is also immunomodulatory, capable of suppressing the production and release of factors which mediate the inflammatory complications of viral diseases (tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6) [121] . it is postulated that chloroquine works by altering ace2 glycosylation and endosomal ph. its anti-inflammatory properties may be beneficial for the treatment of sars. niclosamide as a known drug used in antihelminthic treatment. the efficacy of niclosamide as an inhibitor of virus replication was proven in several assays. in both immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence assays, niclosamide treatment was observed to completely inhibit viral antigen synthesis. reduction of virus yield in infected cells was dose dependent. niclosamide likely does not interfere in the early stages of virus attachment and entry into cells, nor does it function as a protease inhibitor. mechanisms of niclosamide activity warrant further investigation [122] . glycyrrhizin also reportedly inhibits virus adsorption and penetration in the early steps of virus replication. glycyrrhizin was a significantly potent inhibitor with a low selectivity index when tested against several pathogenic flaviviruses. while preliminary results suggest production of nitrous oxide (which inhibits virus replication) through induction of nitrous oxide synthase, the mechanism of glycyrrhizin against sars-cov remains unclear. the compound also has relatively lower toxicity compared to protease inhibitors like ribavirin [123] . inhibitory activity was also detected in baicalin [124] , extracted from another herb used in the treatment of sars in china and hong kong. findings on these compounds are limited to in vitro studies [121] [122] [123] [124] .due to the rapidly evolving situation of the 2019-ncov, there will be potential limitations to the systematic review. the systematic review is likely to have publication bias as some developments have yet to be reported while for other developments there is no intention to report publicly (or in scientific platforms) due to confidentiality concerns. however, this may be limited to only a few developments for review as publicity does help in branding to some extent for the company and/or the funder. furthermore, due to the rapid need to share the status of these developments, there may be reporting bias in some details provided by authors of the scientific articles or commentary articles in traditional media. lastly, while it is not viable for any form of quality assessment and meta-analysis of the selected articles due to the limited data provided and the heterogeneous style of reporting by different articles, this paper has provided a comprehensive overview of the potential developments of these pharmaceutical interventions during the early phase of the outbreak. this systematic review would be useful for cross-check when the quality assessment and meta-analysis of these developments are performed as a follow-up study.rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are key pharmaceutical interventions to limit transmission of respiratory infectious diseases. many potential developments on these pharmaceutical interventions for 2019-ncov are ongoing in the containment phase of this outbreak, potentially due to better pandemic preparedness than before. however, lessons from mers-cov and sars-cov have shown that the journeys for these developments can still be challenging moving ahead.supplementary materials: the following are available online at

strikingly neglected. the pediatric respiratory diseases have received some of the lowest levels of funding compared with other fields of health research [4] . only limited resources have been devoted to rsv or parainfluenza virus vaccine or antiviral drug development, despite the huge impact of these diseases on illness and hospitalization of infants worldwide. it is therefore especially exciting to report important recent developments that result directly from scientific advances applied to prevention of acute respiratory disease.this article is organized around several important individual pediatric pathogens that are responsible for croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in children. pathogens are discussed that have been studied for several decades, including respiratory syncytial virus and the parainfluenza viruses, and viral pathogens that are newly identified as of this writing are human metapneumovirus and human coronavirus nl63. in light of the escalating rate of emergence of new infectious agents, which is fortunately being met with equally rapid advancements in molecular methods of surveillance and pathogen discovery, new organisms will be added to the list in the near future. a section on therapies for bronchiolitis addresses several of the final common pathways that can result from infection with the diverse pathogens, highlighting the mechanisms that may be amenable to therapeutic approaches. the article concludes with a discussion of the overarching impact of new diagnostic strategies.rsv is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract infection in young children, accounting for 50% to 90% of all hospitalizations from bronchiolitis. rsv is a member of the pneumovirus genus within the pneumovirinae subfamily of the paramyxoviridae family of negativestranded rna viruses. rsv replicates initially in the nasopharyngeal epithelium and later spreads to the lower respiratory tract. viral replication in the small airways causes inflammation, sloughing, and necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelium. the resultant edema and increased mucous secretion may, depending on the severity of disease, cause plugging of the small airways, atelectasis, airway narrowing, and obstruction. primary infection with rsv in an immunologically naı¨ve host tends to be the most severe, but whether this usually occurs because of immunopathologic mechanisms, immunologic immaturity, or the smaller vulnerable airways of infected infants, or a combination of factors is unclear. the contribution of the virus, the underlying genetic predisposition of the host, and the components of the inflammatory response form a complex picture in the genesis of severe rsv disease, in which the individual roles remain to be delineated.several abnormal underlying conditions that predispose to severe forms of rsv disease have been enumerated, and include prematurity, preexisting lung disease, and various forms of immunodeficiency. however, one must understand why some apparently healthy infants and children proceed from initial infection to severe lower respiratory tract disease, whereas others experience a relatively mild, self-limited illness. several groups have recently identified normal genetic variation among humans as a major factor in disease severity. specific alleles of interleukin (il)-4 [5] and the il-4 receptor [6] were identified that are associated with more severe disease, and promoter variants of il-10, il-9, and tumor necrosis factor a (tnf-a) genes probably also influence disease severity [7] . variations at the il-10 gene locus are associated with a severe form of disease [8] . ample evidence also exists for a relationship between a locus on the il-8 gene and disease severity [9, 10] .recently identified variants of the chemokine receptor ccr5 also seem to predispose to severe rsv bronchiolitis [11] , and a correlation was established between specific alleles of the genes for surfactant a and d and an increase in disease severity [12, 13] . in light of this mounting evidence for specific genetic contributions to rsv disease severity and the possibility that similar or related genetic variation may underlie predisposition to asthma (and the link between respiratory virus infection and asthma [14] ), understanding the mechanisms whereby these gene alterations influence pathogenesis will be critical. early identification of vulnerable individuals could allow for targeted use of prophylactic strategies to protect those genetically at risk, as is currently practiced only for infants with abnormal underlying conditions. these preventative strategies could impact not only the morbidity and mortality of ari but also the incidence of reactive airway disease.immunity to respiratory syncytial virus and inflammatory responses to respiratory syncytial virus infection rsv primary infection does not confer permanent immunity; repeated reinfection with rsv within 1 year of the previous infection is common in young children, although subsequent infections are usually milder, suggesting some protection against severe disease after primary infection. in adults, secretory neutralizing antibodies (but not serum antibodies) correlate with protection against upper respiratory tract infection, whereas circulating serum antibodies, particularly against f and g glycoproteins, have been shown to protect from infection and decrease progression to the lower airways [15, 16] . the limited degree of protection offered by maternal antibody is underscored by the fact that the peak incidence of serious rsv disease is seen in infants aged 2 to 5 months, when maternal antibody is still circulating within the infant.rsv-induced lower respiratory tract disease (bronchiolitis and pneumonia) results from a balance between cellular damage mediated by the viral pathogen and injury caused by the immune response of the host [17] [18] [19] . although the immunology and immunopathogenesis of rsv infection are not fully understood, humoral and cellular components of the immune system clearly contribute not only to protection from disease but also to pathogenesis of disease.mouse models of rsv disease have been used to dissect the contribution of different t-cell subsets and rsv proteins to the pathology of rsv infection and have shown different disease outcomes, depending on the rsv protein used to prime and the cellular response [20] . for example, in balb/c mice the rsv surface protein g primes for an eosinophilic inflammatory response, mediated by th2-type cd4þ t cells [21] , reminiscent of the responses seen in the formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine model [22] . although transfer of cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) to naı¨ve mice resulted in accelerated viral clearance, immunopathology was also enhanced in mice with very active ctls [23] , indicating that ctls associated with th1-type responses also contribute to the immunopathology observed in rsv-infected mice. recent studies have shown that the pattern recognition receptor cd14 (toll-like receptor 4) participates in the innate immune response to rsv [24] [25] [26] , a response triggered by the f protein.as in the animal models, cell-mediated immunity in children probably contributes to host defense against rsv but also causes much of the pathologic process, and inappropriate immune responses may drive pulmonary inflammation during naturally acquired infection [27] . regulation of the response of t lymphocytes to rsv may be critical in determining the clinical outcome of rsv infection. abnormal t-cell regulatory mechanisms may be related to a hyperactive ige response, which contributes to an enhanced lung infiltrate [28, 29] . several proinflammatory cytokines detected in respiratory secretions from rsv-infected individuals, including il-8, rantes, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (mip-1a), mediate neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis, and these cell types can promote host defense and tissue damage. the contribution of th1 cells to rsv disease in humans is supported by the findings that interferon gamma (ifng) is a prevalent cytokine produced by rsv-specific t-cells, and that the presence of ifng [30] and the levels of mip-1a [31] , rather than levels of th2 cytokines, have been shown to correlate most closely with rsv disease severity.the role of immunopathology in rsv was highlighted after children who had received formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine in 1967 developed enhanced rsv disease on exposure to virus [32] . the intense inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs of vaccinated children suggested an immunopathologic cause of enhanced disease. animal models have been used successfully to study the immune correlates of pathology and the basis for enhanced disease [29] . the overexuberant inflammatory response, with lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration, has been ascribed to an imbalance in the ratio of th1 to th2 cells that could have resulted from poor preservation of f during formalin inactivation [33] . the resulting predominance of g in the formalin-inactivated vaccine was believed to cause a pathologic th2 polarization of the immune response and pulmonary eosinophilia in children who were subsequently naturally infected with rsv.cd4þ t cells play a major role in the immunopathogenesis of vaccineenhanced rsv disease [34] . a marked increase in th2-type cytokine expression (il-5, il-13, il-10) and a reduction in il-12 expression occurred in mice that were immunized with the formalin-inactivated vaccine, indicating a swing toward th2 in the genesis of enhanced inflammation [35] . the presence of il-5 correlated with an eosinophilic infiltration in the mouse lung. in contrast, priming with live rsv resulted in a th1 pattern of cytokine production and prevented subsequent enhanced disease [36] . a recent study in mice suggests that immune complexes that fix complement also play a key role in the pathogenesis of enhanced disease; the augmented disease in mice is mediated by these immune complexes and abrogated in complement component c3 and b cell-deficient mice [37] . the bronchoconstriction component of the enhanced disease seems to be mediated by complement, whereas the enhanced pneumonia component of disease depends on th2 effects.these findings, which enhance understanding of protective immunity and destructive inflammation, suggest important elements to consider in rsv vaccine development [38] . successful vaccines must induce neutralizing antibody and cd8þ virus-specific ctls, and should elicit the cd4 cell response that corresponds to the response to natural infection. although live attenuated vaccines can clearly achieve these goals directly, they are not appropriate for several populations. therefore, novel strategies are also being applied to the development of nonreplicating vaccines.prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease: active immunization rsv vaccine development has been hampered in the past decades by the complex factors described earlier, the concerns that resulted from the history of the early formalin-inactivated vaccine trials, and the limited support for study of pediatric respiratory viruses and vaccine development [38, 39] . livecandidate attenuated rsv vaccines were never observed to cause enhanced rsv disease, and intranasal vaccination with live virus vaccines elicit better mucosal immunity than parenterally administered inactivated virus vaccines. therefore, developing live attenuated vaccines for rsv-naı¨ve populations, including infants, is a priority. however, live attenuated vaccines pose the challenge of finding a balance between overattenuation, with subsequent induction of inefficient immunologic responses, and underattenuation, which may result in disease especially in younger infants. it is therefore heartening to report that recent advances in molecular virology have allowed a live attenuated vaccine candidate to be developed that is well tolerated in infants and protects against challenge [40] .the recovery of infectious virus from cdna clones of rsv [41, 42] , based on advances in molecular virology during the last decade, has completely changed the outlook for developing live attenuated rsv vaccines. new vaccine candidates can now be developed by introducing combinations of attenuating mutations into recombinant rsv through direct manipulation of the dna intermediate. this new strategy is also advantageous for other pediatric respiratory viruses, which are discussed later. specific mutations are introduced based on a rationale for their attenuating effects. this strategy, based on understanding the genetic basis of attenuation and applying it to the design of vaccines, is referred to as reverse genetics and will begin to replace the methods of serial passage of viruses or chemical mutagenesis, strategies that have been classically used to generate attenuating mutations [43] .live cold-passaged (cp), temperature-sensitive (ts) rsv vaccines (cpts vaccines) containing many attenuating mutations were attractive candidates for live attenuated rsv vaccines. one cpts, the 248/404 vaccine candidate, was safe and immunogenic in rsv-seronegative infants as young as 6 months but was not sufficiently attenuated in 4-to 12-week-old infants. therefore, additional attenuating mutations were added using the novel technology, and one new vaccine candidate (ra2cp248/404/1030sh) contains five new independent attenuating genetic elements.in 2005, karron and colleagues [40] evaluated recombinant rsv vaccines in clinical trials for the first time. the candidate vaccine ra2cp248/404/ 1030sh was well tolerated and responsible mainly for mild illness (the lower respiratory tract illness observed was associated with other viral infections). administration of a second dose of this vaccine showed restriction of viral replication, proving that this vaccine could induce protective immunity. consistent with the mechanisms of natural immunity, the antibody responses to this live attenuated virus were not the primary mediators of protection induced by the vaccine. thus, ra2cp248/404/1030sh seems to be the first rsv vaccine candidate that is appropriately attenuated for young infants, including infants 1 to 2 months of age. although half of the youngest infants did not show antibody responses, the limited replication of the second dose suggests that the infants were protected, which is critical because these infants are the most vulnerable and have presented the most challenges to vaccine development. this successful trial provides a map for future trials of recombinant vaccines against rsv and other pediatric respiratory pathogens.subunit vaccines, while not viable for infants and therefore of limited use in the normal population, may provide a suitable approach to vaccination in immunosuppressed populations at high risk of severe rsv infection including high risk children, the elderly, and possibly for maternal immunization [38] . one viral surface glycoprotein, the fusion protein (f), has been used as the antigen for developing subunit vaccines (purified f protein [pfp]-1, pfp-2, and pfp-3). these f subunit vaccines have been shown to be moderately immunogenic and well tolerated in healthy seropositive children older than 12 months, children older than 12 months who have cystic fibrosis, and children older than 12 months who have chronic lung disease of prematurity. a meta-analysis of pfp-1 and pfp-2 studies suggested that these vaccines reduced the incidence of rsv infections but not lower respiratory tract infection [44] . the pfp-2 vaccine may show more promise in pregnant women; in a recent trial, it produced fourfold increases in neutralizing antibody titers in mothers and infants at birth and at 2 months of age [45] . another subunit vaccine candidate is bbg2na, a peptide from the g (receptor-binding) glycoprotein of rsv that is conjugated to the albuminbinding domain of streptococcal protein g [46, 47] . this vaccine is well tolerated, induces neutralizing antibody responses in healthy young adults, and is immunogenic in elderly individuals. finally, subunit vaccines containing copurified f, g, and m proteins formulated with an alum adjuvant are being investigated [38, 48] . however, the likely targets for these vaccines will be elderly adults and those at high risk for severe rsv infection.until effective vaccines for rsv are widely available, passive immunoprophylaxis with rsv antibody preparations is important to protect children at high risk for severe rsv disease. a humanized monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) directed against the rsv fusion protein affords moderate protection to premature infants at high risk for severe rsv disease [49] . palivizumab is administered monthly through intramuscular injection during the rsv season. duration of therapy and indications for prophylaxis depend on gestational age, presence or absence of chronic lung disease, and environmental risk factors that increase rsv risk [50] .another rsv-specific monoclonal antibody derived from palivizumab, medi-524 was developed. compared with palivizumab, this antibody has an 80-fold greater finding affinity for the rsv f protein [51] , is 23 times more potent at neutralizing rsv in vitro [51] , and more effectively reduces rsv titers in the cotton rat model [51, 52] . this preparation is currently in phase 3 trials in children at high risk for rsv and may be preferable to palivizumab in the future. similar approaches using other monoclonal antibodies are in different stages of clinical development.the role of antivirals in treating rsv infection remains uncertain. although some studies have failed to show a correlation between viral load and disease severity, others suggest that reduced viral levels correlate with improved clinical outcomes. these findings are not surprising considering the significant role that proinflammatory responses play in the pathogenesis of this virus. ribavirin is currently the only antiviral agent available for treating children who have rsv lower respiratory tract disease. although ribavirin is a nucleoside analog that has good activity against rsv in vitro, clinical studies examining its effect in children conflict. therefore, its use in children remains highly controversial and should only be considered for certain target populations.several new antiviral strategies against rsv are currently being investigated, including the promising approach of f protein fusion inhibitors. the rsv f (fusion) glycoprotein, like the f of all paramyxoviruses, mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes during infection [53, 54] . the f protein forms a trimer during synthesis and is cleaved during transit to the cell surface to produce the final membrane-distal and membrane-anchored subunits. the carboxyl terminal of the membrane-anchored subunit of paramyxovirus f proteins is anchored to the viral membrane, whereas the newly exposed amino terminal contains the fusion peptide that inserts into target membranes during fusion, which occurs at neutral ph [55] . initially, the paramyxovirus fusion peptide lies deep within the hydrophobic core of the f protein, and for the virion to fuse with the target membrane and effect viral entry, the f protein must undergo an activation step exposing the fusion peptide [56] . for the paramyxovirus hpiv-3, the authors found that the f protein is activated when the adjacent receptorbinding protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (hn), binds to a sialic acid-containing receptor, permitting fusion to occur. on receptor binding, the receptor-binding protein triggers f to fuse [57, 58] but must interact with its respective receptor for fusion to occur [53, 57, [59] [60] [61] . this mechanism has now been shown to be true for paramyxoviruses in general [56] ; for rsv, g (the receptor binding glycoprotein) must be present and trigger f to fuse. fig. 1 contains a schematic of the structural transitions that occur once f is activated, and that mediate membrane merger. the ectodomain of the membrane-anchored subunit of f protein contains two hydrophobic domains: the fusion peptide that inserts into the cellular target membrane during fusion and the transmembrane-spanning domain. the fusion peptide is adjacent to the n-terminal heptad repeat (hrn) and the transmembrane domain is adjacent to the c-terminal heptad repeat (hrc). the transient intermediate of f that is anchored to viral and cell membranes is believed to refold and assemble into a fusogenic six-helix bundle (6hb) structure as the hrn and hrc associate into a tight complex with n-and c-peptides aligned in an antiparallel arrangement. the refolding relocates the fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor to the same side, pulling the viral and cell membranes into close proximity and driving fusion [62] .the refolding step of f provides an attractive target for antivirals. the ability of heptad repeat peptides to interfere with the analogous fusion process for hiv has led to a clinically effective peptide inhibitor of hiv infection (t-20, enfuvirtide) [63] [64] [65] . peptides derived from the hrc-peptide regions of several paramyxoviruses, including sendai, measles, newcastle disease virus, rsv, and piv5, can interfere with fusion intermediates of paramyxovirus f proteins [63, [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] and can inhibit viral infectivity in vitro [66] [67] [68] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] . it has been proposed that this inhibition occurs because the peptides bind to their complementary heptad repeat region, thereby preventing hrn and hrc from refolding into the 6hb stable structure required for fusion [56, 62, 69] .in a related approach, it was recently observed that the c-terminal of the hrn trimer contains a hydrophobic pocket that provides a potential binding site for small molecules that might interfere with the stability of the hairpin structure [76] , and could provide advantages over the use of peptides in clinical use. a low molecular weight molecule that is highly effective in inhibiting rsv fusion was recently shown to bind this hydrophobic pocket of hrn, suggesting that a small molecule that disrupts the hairpin can derail the rsv fusion process [77] . inhibition of the f-triggering process by peptides or other small molecules that interact with the heptad repeat regions is a promising area for development of antiviral therapies and awaits further study.several other novel experimental approaches to inhibit rsv replication include the use of antisense oligonucleotides and rna interference technology. these approaches, although promising, are still in early stages of development [78] . the hpiv types 1, 2, and 3 (hpiv-1, -2, and -3) are the major cause of croup. although rsv ranks as the most common agent of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, with hmpv also possibly contributing significantly [1] , parainfluenza viruses also follow closely behind [2] . hpiv-3 alone is responsible for approximately 11% of pediatric respiratory hospitalizations in the united states [79, 80] and is the predominant cause of croup in young infants. hpiv-1 and -3 belong to the respirovirus genus within the paramyxovirinae subfamily of the paramyxoviridae family of negative-stranded rna viruses, whereas hpiv-2 belongs to the rubulavirus genus.although vaccination programs and antiviral use have helped suppress other causes of respiratory disease in children, such as influenza and measles, children are still unaided in their battle against the major cause of croup. while for rsv effective strategies of prophylaxis are available to protect the groups at most risk [81] , no weapons are currently available against the parainfluenza viruses.parainfluenza viruses replicate in the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract and spread to the lower respiratory tract within 3 days. croup results from inflammatory obstruction of the airway. epithelial cells of the small airways may become infected, with resultant necrosis and inflammatory infiltrates. the interplay between virus-induced cell damage, beneficial immune responses, and inflammatory responses that contribute to hpiv-3 disease has not been as well studied as for rsv. however, as with rsv, disease severity is often probably increased, and the pathology of clinical disease actually caused, by the inflammatory response rather than the cytopathic effects of the virus. this fundamental concept is highlighted by the fact that virus titers in the infected hosts are generally waning when disease symptoms become apparent [2] and that virus titer does not correlate with the severity of lower respiratory disease. the pathologic changes in children who died from parainfluenza infection suggest exaggerated inflammation [82, 83] rather than simply tissue destruction by virus.hpiv primary infection does not confer permanent immunity. however, although reinfection occurs, immunity is usually sufficient to restrict virus replication from the lower respiratory tract and prevent severe disease. mucosal iga levels correlate with protection from replication of parainfluenza viruses in humans [84, 85] . cell-mediated immunity also contributes importantly to preventing disease. for example, hpiv-3 infection in infants who are t-cell-deficient can cause a fatal giant-cell pneumonia [84, 85] , and hpiv pneumonia has a 30% mortality in bone marrow transplant recipients [86] .a cotton rat (sigmodon hispidus) model of disease has been useful in analyzing factors affecting the pathogenesis of hpiv-3 in vivo. experimental infection of the cotton rat with hpiv-3 leads to infection of bronchiolar epithelial cells, bronchiolitis, and interstitial pneumonia, mimicking human disease and making it a relevant model for hpiv-3 lower respiratory infection [87] . the authors studied cotton rats infected with either wild-type hpiv-3 or variant viruses containing hn molecules with individual mutations that conferred high receptor-binding avidity or low neuraminidase (receptor-cleaving) activity [88] . the infected animals experienced normal clearance of the variant viruses as opposed to the wild-type viruses; however, each of the hn protein alterations led to striking differences in the ability of hpiv-3 to cause extensive disease in the cotton rat lung. the variants caused alveolitis and an interstitial infiltrate, whereas the wild-type virus only caused peribronchiolitis, and the enhanced disease caused by the hn variants was manifested by greatly increased inflammatory cell infiltrate in the alveoli and interstitial spaces in the lung. this finding suggested that the differences between variants were caused by modulation of the inflammatory response through the different hn protein activity of the variants, and are dissociated from viral replication or infectivity. the authors hypothesize that mutations in the hn protein that alter either its affinity for receptor or its receptor-cleaving activity may modify the nature of the inflammatory response of the host. by using hn variants to dissect the etiology of enhanced disease it may be possible to identify which component(s) of the immune system's response to hpiv3 contributes to disease. experiments are underway to determine whether hpiv-3 hn protein alterations that enhance disease specifically alter chemokine expression. the results will provide information that could be used to develop therapies to modulate an overactive inflammatory response after hpiv infection.the development of a vaccine for the parainfluenza viruses has been hampered by the need to induce an immune response in young infants whose immature immune systems and maternal antibodies interfere with the development of an adequate immune response. an inactivated hpiv-1, -2, -3 vaccine used in infants in the late 1960s was immunogenic but did not offer protection from infection [89, 90] . experimental vaccines are being evaluated, and a vaccine for hpiv-3 and perhaps also hpiv-1 is anticipated [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] . this progress has benefited greatly from the recent advances in molecular virology.two different strategies are being developed for hpiv-3 vaccines. one is a live-attenuated bovine parainfluenza type 3 (bpiv-3) vaccine, and the other is a vaccine based on a cold-adapted attenuated strain. the bpiv-3 vaccine is attenuated in humans by nature of host range. the bovine virus itself, when used to infect humans, was well tolerated but did not induce similar levels of antibody titers seen in infection with the human virus. therefore, the reverse genetics approach was used to generate a set of hpiv-3 variants that carry individual genes from the bovine virus (chimeric viruses). these strains elicited an improved antibody response and, in monkeys, protected against hpiv-3 infection. two of the chimeric viruses, one containing the hn gene from the bovine virus in a human virus background and the other containing the f and hn glycoprotein genes from the human virus in the bovine virus background are now viewed as the strongest vaccine candidates for human trials [96] [97] [98] . the latter candidate combines the host range restriction of bpiv-3 with the major antigenic determinants of hpiv-3, permitting efficient replication in vitro (which is beneficial for vaccine development) along with host range phenotype and excellent antigenicity. the bovine/human chimeric approach is also being used to create a strategy for vaccinating simultaneously against hpiv-3 and rsv, and possibly also hmpv. the chimeric virus that contains the hpiv-3 f and hn glycoprotein genes in the bpiv-3 background was engineered to also express protective antigens to rsv and hmpv, and this strategy will lead to bivalent vaccines against hpiv-3/rsv or hpiv-3/hmpv using a single virus. the bpiv-3/hpiv-3 chimera that also expresses rsv f is in clinical trials.the hpivs are also theoretically well suited as vaccine vectors for other pediatric pathogen vaccines, especially those that use the respiratory portal for entry, because the intranasal route of administration is highly advantageous. hpiv-3-based vaccines would immunize within the first 6 months of life because the virus infects in early infancy, whereas vaccines using hpiv-1 or hpiv-2 backbones could be used in the second half of the first year of life. taking the strategy of reverse genetics using hpiv as a backbone vaccine one step further, hpivs could thereby be used as vaccine vectors for other viruses that infect through the respiratory portal, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and ebola. a bpiv-3/hpiv-3 virus expressing the spike glycoprotein of sars-coronavirus elicited a neutralizing antibody response and protection against challenge with sars in african green monkeys [99] . hpiv-3 expressing the glycoprotein of ebola was highly effective in a guinea pig model [100] and is being evaluated in primates. these types of vaccines could be developed to protect children against emerging infections.the second attenuated virus being developed for hpiv-3 vaccines, cp45, is based on a live cpts vaccine containing many attenuating mutations. this vaccine is both well-tolerated and immunogenic in children and infants, even those as young as 1 to 2 months [91, 93, 101, 102] and is being further evaluated in clinical trials [93] . given the promise of this candidate, an attenuated rsv vaccine (the 248/404 cpts vaccine) was tested in combination with the hpiv-3 cp45 vaccine. although some interference occurred between the two virus vaccines, the results justify further evaluation of combination vaccines [101] .several features of the viral lifecycle make parainfluenza viruses vulnerable to attack (fig. 2) . the parainfluenza viruses enter their target cell by binding to a receptor molecule and then fusing their viral envelope with the cell membrane to gain access to the cytoplasm. because binding and fusion are critical steps for infection to proceed, interfering with these critical processes at the entry stage of the viral lifecycle would prevent disease. the hpiv-3 f protein was found to be fully activated only when the adjacent receptor-binding protein hn binds to sialic acidcontaining receptor, permitting fusion to occur. on receptor binding, hn actively triggers f to fuse [57, 58, 61] . this mechanism is true for most paramyxoviruses [56] . the receptor-binding protein of these viruses, including hpiv-1 and hpiv-2, rsv, measles virus, hendra virus, and nipah virus, must interact with its respective receptor for fusion to occur [53, 57, [59] [60] [61] .the authors identified and functionally characterized specific receptorinteracting sites on the hpiv-3 hn molecule [60, 103, 104] , and once the three-dimensional crystal structure of the hn protein was solved [105] , they mapped these functional sites onto the hn structure [106] . with this information, binding inhibitors can now be designed specifically to fit into the binding pocket on the globular head of hn (fig. 2b) [107, 108] . in addition to interfering with receptor binding by the hn protein, this blockade will interfere with the f-triggering function of the hn protein, which can only occur when the hn protein is in contact with its receptor.the f-triggering function provides a target for several antiviral strategies. first, based on a recent analysis of the f-triggering process, peptides corresponding to the hr domains of f (see fig. 1 ) can be designed to prevent the f protein from reaching its fusion-active state (fig. 2c) . the authors are performing computational modeling, based on the three-dimensional structure of the related parainfluenza virus 5 (piv5, previously called simian virus 5 or sv5) f [109] , to predict which peptides will be most active, and will then test these predictions experimentally. this strategy has been effective at improving the design of antiviral peptides for paramyxoviruses [71] . preliminary studies in the authors' laboratory also suggest that the normal triggering process may be subverted, causing the f protein to become activated before it reaches the target host cell and incapacitating f before it can mediate viral entry. the authors have shown that specific mutations in the stalk region of hn affect hn's ability to trigger f protein [57] , and that specific features of the globular head region of hn modulate this triggering function [61] . however, how the signal for activation is transmitted from hn to f protein is unknown. for example, if hn's receptor binding induces a conformational change in hn, how does this change lead to activation of f? a more detailed understanding of this pathway should lead to additional targets for interruption of viral entry.because hpiv-3 pathogenesis is probably largely caused by the inflammatory response to infection, the findings that specific alterations in hn protein correlate with enhanced pathology and that hn may play a role in eliciting inflammatory responses suggest that approaches to modulating the inflammatory response may ameliorate disease ( fig. 2a) .finally, the hn molecule, in addition to binding to receptors, contains neuraminidase (receptor-cleaving) activity, and cleaves the sialic acid moieties of cellular receptors, allowing new virions to be released from the host cell surface and infection to spread. although neuraminidase inhibition is unlikely to be as effective an antiviral strategy for parainfluenza viruses as it has been for influenza virus [58, 104, 110, 111] , specific inhibition of this activity could prevent virion entry into additional uninfected cells (fig. 2d) . these several potential therapeutic targets are being actively pursued with the hope that they will open new avenues for parainfluenza infection interference; certainly, strategies to protect and treat children with parainfluenza virus infection are urgently needed.hmpv is a newly identified respiratory virus that is associated with lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children. this virus was first reported in the netherlands in 2001 [112] by investigators who identified sequences of the virus after performing randomly primed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) analysis of respiratory secretions from children who had lower respiratory tract disease. hmpv belongs to the metapneumovirus genus within the pneumovirinae subfamily of the paramyxoviridae family of negative-stranded rna viruses. hmpv may account for much of the lower respiratory disease in young children that was of previously unknown origin [1, 113] , and a significant portion of upper respiratory infection [114] . it may also cause wheezing episodes in late winter to spring [115] and, less frequently, croup or pneumonia.although significant information about hmpv has accrued in the 5 years since the virus was recognized as a cause of respiratory disease, much remains to be learned about the incidence of hpmv in specific populations, its basic virology, the strain variation, and the mechanisms of pathogenesis and immunity. little is known about the correlates of immunity to hmpv infection or about the host-pathogen balance in lung disease, but features are probably shared with rsv and parainfluenza. infection induces serum-neutralizing antibodies in experimentally infected animals, and protection against reinfection has been induced through primary infection in several animal models [116] [117] [118] .a cotton rat model was recently developed for hmpv, with similar features to the cotton rat model for hpiv-3 [118] . cotton rats were inoculated intranasally with hmpv. the infected cotton rat lungs exhibited the histopathologic changes of peribronchial inflammatory infiltrates, and immunohistochemical staining detected virus at the luminal surfaces of respiratory epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract. the cotton rats mounted neutralizing antibody responses against hpmv, and on subsequent rechallenge with hmpv, the animals exhibited partial protection in terms of viral replication and lung disease. therefore, the cotton rat will probably be a useful small animal model of hmpv infection that, as for rsv and hpiv-3, reflects the disease and the correlates of immunity or immunopathology in children [81, 87, 119, 120] . this model will now facilitate the in vivo studies of pathogenesis that lead to development of vaccine and antiviral candidates.for hpmv, vaccine strategies immediately benefited from the advances in reverse genetics and vaccine technology that were developed for rsv and hpiv-3 and allow recombinant engineered viruses to be generated from dna clones of viral genes. as a result, live attenuated virus vaccine development for hpmv is already in progress. recombinant hmpv strains were generated, representing rescue of strains from canada (strain can97-83) and the netherlands (strains nl/1/00 and nl/1/99) entirely from cdna [121] . several chimeric viruses were generated that are considered suitable vaccine candidates. for example, hpmv viruses in which several individual genes (the small hydrophobic protein gene sh, the receptor-binding protein gene g, or the m2 gene) or open reading frames were deleted were assessed for their ability to replicate and their efficacy as intranasal vaccines in african green monkeys [122] . each gene-deletion recombinant virus, although highly attenuated, was also very immunogenic and protected the monkeys against challenge with hmpv. two of these viruses (g-deleted and m2-deleted) are promising vaccine candidates [122] . in a different recombinant approach, chimeras were generated by replacing the nucleoprotein or phosphoprotein (p) open reading frame of hmpv with the corresponding gene from the avian metapneumovirus subgroup c [123] . when tested in african green monkeys immunized intranasally and intratracheally, both chimeras were comparable to wild-type hmpv in their immunogenicity and protective efficacy, and the p chimera, although it exhibited excellent growth in vitro (making it feasible for vaccine development) was also highly attenuated. thus, the p chimera could be a superb vaccine candidate that combines good growth in vitro with attenuation in vivo and excellent protection in a primate model [123] . candidate vaccines will probably emerge from clinical trials fairly soon, underscoring the importance of recent advances in molecular virology of respiratory viruses in accelerating clinical vaccine development.several newly identified members of the coronavirus family cause lower respiratory disease. one is sars-coronavirus, the etiologic agent of sars, first detected after cases of a severe atypical pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in late 2002. the disease rapidly spread to more than 25 countries and sickened thousands of individuals by april 2003, and the global medical and scientific communities engaged in a striking cooperative effort that led to rapid progress in identifying the sars-coronavirus and diagnosing this severe disease [124] [125] [126] [127] . outbreaks have been effectively contained, and research is underway to develop protective measures against this infrequent but fatal disease.the second novel coronavirus, human coronavirus nl63 (hcov-nl63), is less virulent but seems to be far more common and a frequent cause of lower respiratory tract disease in young children. two different groups identified the virus in 2004 [128, 129] . the following year, hcov-nl63-specific quantitative real-time pcr was used to define the clinical spectrum of disease by analyzing more than 900 samples from a prospective study on lower respiratory tract infection in children younger than 3 years [130] . hcov-nl63 was found to be the third most frequently detected pathogen after rsv and hpiv-3. the infection was strongly associated with croup (rather than bronchiolitis), suggesting a causal relationship, and therefore was probably somewhat less pathogenic than rsv [130] . thus, another significant cause of respiratory disease in children was added to the list.cell tropism and receptor use of hcov-nl63 have been recently analyzed [131] . receptor identification was performed using the new technology of pseudotyping viruses, in which the surface proteins of one virus can be incorporated into the membrane of another viral particle (eg, hpiv-3 glycoproteins in a retrovirus particle). thus, binding and entry assays can be performed using the well-characterized and molecularly malleable retrovirus particle. the pseudotype allows engineering of any desired variant of the viral envelope protein being studied, and provides reporter assays for assessment of the envelope protein's ability to mediate binding, fusion, and entry. to identify the hcov-nl63 receptor, the hcov-nl63 spike (s) protein was incorporated into the membrane of retroviral particles to analyze cell tropism and receptor engagement of hcov-nl63 [131] . the nl63 s protein was found to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), the receptor for sars-coronavirus, and to use ace2 as a receptor for infection of target cells. potent neutralizing activity directed against hcov-nl63's s protein was detected in most sera from individuals aged 8 years or older, suggesting that hcov-nl63 infection of humans is commonly acquired during childhood. the facts that sars-coronavirus and hcov-nl63 use the same receptor but differ greatly in pathogenicity, and hcov-nl63 infection in children seems to be such a frequent event, raise the concern that pathogenic variants could evolve and highlight the need for coronavirus vaccine development.investigation into antiviral strategies began in 2006, 2 years after the new viral agent was identified [132] . several existing antiviral drugs and new synthetic compounds were tested preliminarily as inhibitors of hcov-nl63, and several potential strategies were identified for further study, including hr peptides that could interfere with the fusion protein's function and several small interfering rnas [132] . identifying common themes in strategies for inhibiting a diverse array of pediatric respiratory viruses (eg, using hr peptides to interfere with fusion during entry) will likely allow advances in the study of one virus to benefit antiviral strategies for other viruses. the scientific progress in understanding viral replication, entry, and fusion for other respiratory viruses will likely benefit the search for antiviral strategies for this newest member of the group of viruses that cause respiratory disease in children.in 1963, two leading pediatricians summarized the ''state of the art'' of bronchiolitis treatment: ''to sum up, oxygen is vitally important and there is little convincing evidence that any other therapy is consistently or even occasionally useful'' [133] . unfortunately, more than 40 years later, this statement is largely still true and few real advances have been made in the pharmacologic treatment of bronchiolitis. the occurrence of wheezing in both rsv-induced bronchiolitis and asthma, coupled with the observation that many infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis caused by rsv or other respiratory viruses are at increased risk for recurrent wheezing episodes in early childhood [134] [135] [136] [137] , has largely directed the most drug development to focus on acute bronchiolitis to various asthma therapies. in fact, genetic factors governing airway size and control of airway function and variability in the inflammatory response to the viral infection, together with environmental exposures, appear to contribute not only to the pattern of disease seen in acute bronchiolitis but also to the predisposition to recurrent wheezing/asthma [138, 139] .although understanding the mechanisms linking viral bronchiolitis and asthma is critical in light of the implications for therapy, this association remains elusive. as a result, treating bronchiolitis with the same strategies for treating an acute asthma episode has not yielded consistent benefit over the past few decades. corticosteroids (systemic or inhaled), b agonists, mixed a and b agonists, anticholinergics, and theophylline have been tried and have been generally largely ineffective [140] [141] [142] . in light of the pathology of airway obstruction associated with bronchiolitis (desquamation of the respiratory epithelium and airway wall edema), this lack of effectiveness is not surprising. acute reversible airways obstruction, although common in children who have asthma, is not a constant finding in some patients who have viral bronchiolitis [143] , and may relate to the type of immune response generated by the infection. advances in knowledge of the immunologic and inflammatory factors that contribute to disease may suggest new approaches to treatment and facilitate understanding of the relationship between viral bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing [19] .cysteinyl leukotriene (ltc4, ltd4, and lte4) concentrations were recently found to be elevated in upper and lower respiratory tract secretions from infants who had rsv bronchiolitis [144, 145] . these leukotrienes play a key role in the airway obstruction associated with asthma by mediating mucosal edema, mucus hyper-secretion, recruitment of eosinophils, and smooth muscle contraction. bisgaard and colleagues [146] showed that a 4week course of the cysteinyl leukotriene blocker montelukast in infants who had acute rsv bronchiolitis reduced daytime cough and increased the number of symptom-free days. although this study population included children up to 36 months of age experiencing first-time wheezing, a detailed analysis of these data suggests that the effect was most pronounced in the younger subjects, an observation that correlates well with the evidence for higher levels of leukotriene levels in infants younger than 6 months [145, 146] . the study design focused on long-term rather than acute effects, and insufficient data support the use of montelukast for treating milder forms of the disease, or for relieving airways obstruction in the acute setting. as those authors and an accompanying editorial note, further investigation in an appropriate study population with documented rsv infection are needed to gauge the benefit of this therapy [147] .the observation that secretions composed primarily of desquamated epithelial cells obstruct the small airways in children who have bronchiolitis suggested the use of recombinant human deoxyribonuclease i, a treatment that has been effective in patients who have cystic fibrosis. in one study of hospitalized infants who had acute rsv bronchiolitis, the chest radiographs at discharge showed that recombinant human dnase treatment was associated with significant improvement [148] . however, therapy did not affect other clinical features, such as respiratory rate, wheezing, and retractions. a similar, smaller intervention study in more severely ill patients also showed this therapy to be effective in correcting massive atelectasis and avoiding the need for mechanical ventilation in patients who had impending respiratory failure [149] . as with leukotrienes, more studies are needed to define the usefulness of this therapy. this intervention is one of few that focus on addressing the problem of airway obstruction.decreased levels of surfactant protein (sp)-a, -b, and -d have been reported in infants who have rsv bronchiolitis [150] . in mice, surfactant deficiency confers an increased susceptibility to inflammation during rsv infection [151, 152] . if this increased susceptibility is also found in humans, identifying infants deficient in sp-a or -d who would be at risk for more severe rsv disease would be beneficial to target for prevention and therapy. therefore, surfactant replacement is logical not only because of its effect on improving lung function but also because of the potential benefits of decreasing inflammation. in a small study of ventilated patients who had rsv bronchiolitis, the patients experiencing respiratory failure who were treated with two doses of bovine surfactant showed improved static compliance (indicative of decreased hyperinflation) and decreased airways resistance compared with the untreated patients [153] . no acute improvement in gas exchange occurred, but the group treated with surfactant showed improved oxygenation and ventilation indices over the first 60 hours of mechanical ventilation. unfortunately, surfactant currently must be delivered through endotracheal intubation, and therefore this therapy is reserved for children in respiratory failure. larger studies are needed to assess the effects of surfactant on the duration of mechanical ventilation and on viral clearance [154] .the development of accurate and rapid diagnostic assays for respiratory viruses is key for two seemingly separate but rapidly converging arenas. diagnosis will become increasingly important to clinical management of individual children, and is urgently needed for global public health, including pathogen surveillance. in recent years significant progress has been made in applying advances in molecular biology to respiratory virus diagnosis, and some of the new strategies are already clinically useful [155] [156] [157] . for the practitioner, guidelines and clear data are needed regarding the situations in which specific kinds of assays may be appropriate. the transition of these technologies from the development stage to the clinically useful stage is still in flux. however, one may look forward to a situation in which public health institutions will be rapidly responsive to pathogens arising in the community and practitioners will be able to use detailed information to guide prevention or therapy.masstag polymerase chain reaction: a paradigm for new detection strategies for early recognition and containment of a wide range of respiratory pathogensrecently, briese and colleagues [158] described the development of a masstag pcr for differential diagnosis of respiratory disease. masstag pcr is a multiplex assay in which the pathogen gene targets are coded by a library of 64 distinct mass tags. the microbial rna or dna is amplified by multiplex rt-pcr using up to 64 primers. each primer is labeled with a different molecular weight tag, which is attached to the primer with a photo-cleavable link. after amplification, the mass tags are released from the amplified material with uv irradiation, and the identity of the tag is determined with mass spectrometry. the identity of the organism is determined from the presence of its two specific tags, one from each primer. the technology was successfully applied to respiratory disease in its first test case [158] . the multiplex primer sets were designed to identify up to 22 respiratory pathogens in a single masstag pcr reaction, and the method was found to be highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing these viral and bacterial agents in clinical samples. the tests were performed using blinded analysis of previously diagnosed clinical specimens (banked sputum, nasal swabs, and lung washes), and the masstag pcr was highly effective at identifying all pathogens, including rsv; hpiv-1, -2, and -3; hmpv; influenza; and coronavirus-sars (hcov-nl63 was not included in the study). this technology probably will be used most immediately in the public health setting for identifying outbreaks and global surveillance. as the technology becomes streamlined and mass spectrometry becomes more easily accessible, this method has great potential for individual patient management.diagnosing respiratory syncytial virus and paramyxovirus human parainfluenza virus in the clinical setting rsv and hpiv antigens can be rapidly identified in individual patients using commercially available rapid screening kits with sensitivities and specificities of 80% to 90%. these tests are performed directly on nasopharyngeal secretions using either fluorescent-conjugated antibody or elisa with a monoclonal antibody [155] . multiplex quantitative rt-pcr-enzyme hybridization assays can identify a panel of respiratory viruses and differentiate between rsv viral subtypes a and b and hpiv-1, -2 and -3 [159] [160] [161] . the hexaplex assay (prodesse, inc., milwaukee, wisconsin) [159] is a multiplex rt-pcr assay for detecting hpiv-1, -2, and -3; rsv a and b; and influenza virus types a and b. although the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are excellent [159] , confirmation with viral culture (either rapid or traditional) is still important, especially with a negative result in an ill child. pcr-based technology may provide a useful contribution to diagnosis and subtyping of rsv and hpiv-3 in the future [157] .these assay kits, and those for antigen detection, allow simple screening of children and will likely be used more commonly in the future as more therapies for pediatric respiratory viruses become available. however, it is hoped that the importance of accurate viral diagnosis gains wider acceptance among practitioners, especially during influenza season, when prompt specific treatment for influenza can effectively shorten the duration and lessen the severity of disease in children [110] . identification of the etiologic agent, even if no specific therapy is available, is critical in containing respiratory virus outbreaks and avoiding transmission to vulnerable individuals.although hmpv was included among the 22 respiratory pathogens successfully identified in the single masstag pcr described earlier [158] , clinical diagnosis of this recently identified pathogen is still less developed than for rsv and hpiv. however, molecular methods have been developed recently [162] [163] [164] . hmpv virus in respiratory secretions is best identified with rt-pcr. several of the original clinical reports on this virus used rt-pcr assays that used pcr primers hybridizing to the polymerase (l) gene, and used the l gene pcr product sequence to identify the virus. faster and specific real-time rt-pcr tests were developed over the past 2 years that can also detect viruses from the four known genetic lineages of hmpv [163] [164] [165] .diagnostic strategies for hcov-nl63 were developed for use in population studies to assess the incidence of infection with this virus and its association with respiratory disease [130, 166] . whether hcov-nl63 diagnosis will have a place in practice, or whether identifying this agent will be most important in the public health setting, is unclear. a ''pan-coronavirus'' rt-pcr assay was recently developed and used to assess respiratory disease in hospitalized children [166] . the original consensus rt-pcr assay, which was designed to amplify all known coronaviruses, is unable to detect hcov-nl63 because of mismatches with the primer sequences [167] . for the new assay, the consensus primers were modified based on an alignment with the hcov-nl63 prototype sequence. in addition to hcov-nl63 and sarscoronavirus, the two other human coronaviruses known to infect the respiratory tract, oc43 (hcov-oc43) and 229e (hcov-229e), were included in the optimized pan-coronavirus rt-pcr assay. in addition to identifying the specific viral infections, sequence analysis of amplified gene segments showed that the hcov-nl63 isolates could be classified into the two subtypes corresponding to the two prototype hcov-nl63 sequences.the pan-coronavirus assay was tested not only on the four known human coronaviruses, but also on three animal coronaviruses: feline infectious peritonitis virus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, and murine hepatitis virus. the results suggest that the assay efficiently amplifies a broad range of coronaviruses, both human and animal. this pan-coronavirus rt-pcr assay could be especially useful for its ability to identify previously unknown coronaviruses.colleagues at the national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases for their unwavering support of pediatric respiratory virus research.originating in guangdong province, china, in 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) became the first pandemic outbreak of the twenty first century. the disease caused over 8000 infections and was responsible for almost 800 deaths. most remarkably, sars quickly became a disease of global importance, impacting air travel, commerce, and tourism. while the outbreak was eventually contained using an impressive joint global public health effort, 10 years later, another human coronavirus (cov) has emerged as the causative agent of middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). as of may 2016, there have already been 1728 laboratory confirmed cases of mers in 27 countries worldwide, with 624 related deaths, 86 of which recorded during an ongoing outbreak in buraydah, saudi arabia [1]. recurrent episodes like this have impressed upon the scientific community the need to advance development, licensure, manufacture, stockpiling, and deployment of vaccines to combat these emerging infectious coronavirus infections [2] . in this review, the progress in the area of vaccine development for mers-cov is appraised, with an assessment of lessons learned from the response to the earlier sars-cov pandemic.the coronavirus family received global attention in november 2002 when the first case of sars-cov infection was reported in guangdong province, china. within 3 months, 305 cases with five deaths from respiratory failure had been recorded. this subsequently led to the notification of the world health organization (who) and the issuance of a global health alert as well as travel advisory. in retrospect, there probably was an initial delay in the identification of this etiological agent of unknown origin which consequently allowed the worldwide spread of the disease [3] . the scientific community though was subsequently quick to respond and begin the race towards vaccine development [4] . the full characterization and genome sequencing of sars-cov was published within only 2 months after the who had started to coordinate the efforts to determine the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and transmission of the disease. vaccine studies quickly identified the virus' spike (s) protein as a possible recombinant antigen component of a future vaccine, and the cterminal portion of the sars-cov nucleocapsid protein was identified as a likely candidate for improved diagnostics tools. a candidate dna vaccine showing efficacy in neutralization and protective immunity in mice had been identified within 1 year of the outbreak [5] . vaccine development was fueled by the daunting possibility of a re-emergence of the disease when additional isolated cases of a suspected sars infection scare were reported in china in 2004 [6] . at that point, there were ten human vaccine trials planned, using inactivated virus, recombinant proteins, adenovirus platforms, or plasmid dna. the trials were planned to take place in various countries, including china, canada, france, austria, the usa, and italy [7] . the major hurdle, however, was the lack of an appropriate animal challenge model that could reproduce an infection similar to what was observed in humans. then, with the identification of virus reservoirs and mechanisms of transmission, the sars outbreaks ended in july 2003, only 4 months after the issuance of the global alert. the outcomes of this vaccine development race were summarized in a phase i clinical trial report published several years later. two vaccine candidates were developed and analyzed by sinovac and the nih/niaid, respectively. the earliest live-attenuated vaccine clinical trial that took place under a fast track designation approval from regulatory authorities in china was conducted in 2004 [8, 9] . results indicated that serum conversion was observed in 100 % of the volunteers who received a low dosage vaccine. in the other study, a plasmid dna vaccine candidate developed by the niaid's vaccine research centre was well tolerated and produced the desired immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies [10] . none of the candidates though proceeded into phase ii. more recently, a recombinant subunit-based sars-cov vaccine was produced by the sabin vaccine institute product development partnership, based on the virus receptor-binding domain [11] . the goal here was to improve safety of the vaccine and cost efficiency of the vaccine development process [12] . the vaccine is being produced under cgmp conditions, but no clinical trials are immediately scheduled.for the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), the first case was reported in june 2012 in saudi arabia. this isolate was initially named hcov-emc1 and was traced back to a cluster of pneumonia cases in the zarqa hospital (jordan) in march/april 2012. in september 2012, a report from the uk about a novel coronavirus (london1) was published, involving a patient with a travel history to qatar. shortly thereafter, both isolates were found to be similar, and were named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), a betacoronavirus phylogenetically closely related to sars-cov. by october 2013, there had been 144 laboratory confirmed cases with 17 probable cases affecting nine countries.despite increased global vigilance, in part certainly due to the prior experience with sars-cov, cases of mers-cov were still reported outside the middle east 3 years after its first emergence. the largest of these was reported in south korea in june 2015 [13] and was traced back to a single traveler that visited four various middle eastern countries. within a month, this outbreak involved 160 confirmed patients and placed thousands of individuals under close observation [14] . overall, it is speculated that the lower number of cases of mers in comparison to sars may be due to the better coordination of notifications, early travel advisories, the implementation of improved hospital containment measures, the issuance of a global alert by the who, and better compliance with international health provisions, originally drafted in 2007 [3] .although there is the possibility that mers could potentially follow the pandemic path of sars based on the similarity in phylogenetics, the difference in the biology of the virus and its adaptation to human beings are distinct. while mers-cov was found to be already circulating in human populations without mutating into a pandemic form, sars-cov adapted to human beings within several months showing the complexity of the virus biology. the affinity of the mers-cov spike protein for the human dpp4 receptor is lower than that of the sars-cov rbd towards the human ace-2 receptor and thus the pandemic potential of mers-cov has been considered to be lower than that of sars, likely not reaching epidemic potential [15] . nevertheless, there remains valid concern especially since its fatality rate of 36 % is much higher than that for sars (~10 %).in table 1 , we summarize the various approaches to developing a mers-cov vaccine.sars-cov, inactivated by means of formaldehyde, uv light, or beta-propiolactone, was able to protect mice from infection in challenge studies [16] [17] [18] . in analogy, for mers, a recombinant, propagation-defective live virus lacking the structural envelope protein gene has been proposed as a vaccine candidate to prevent mers-cov infection [19] .the mers-cov genome is approximately 30 kb in size [20] and encodes several unique accessory proteins and four major structural proteins: the receptor-binding spike (s) protein, a nucleocapsid (n) protein, an envelope (e) protein, and the membrane (m) protein [21] . the initial expectation that the host cell entry point for mers-cov would be similar to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor used by sars-cov was not confirmed. instead, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp4) receptor was identified as the critical receptor for entry of mers-cov into its host cell [22] . dpp4 does not share any structural similarities to ace2 and has a more diverse cellular tropism as it is expressed on the surface of several types of cells [23] . while sars-cov specifically targets ace2-expressing ciliated epithelial cells in the lungs [24, 25] , dpp4 plays a more diverse role including in the regulation of peptide hormone metabolism, t cell activation, neurotransmitter function, and glucose homeostasis [26] . notably, the mers-cov spike protein exhibits a high affinity for dpp4 receptors from a wide range of hosts, including human, camel, and horse [27] .the 193 amino acid residue receptor-binding domain (rbd) fragment of the s1 subunit of the sars-cov spike protein was able to induce neutralizing antibodies and protect against sars-cov infection in animal models [28, 29] . using homology modeling, the corresponding mers-cov rbd was located between residues 377 to 662 in the s protein [30•] .several variants of the rbd have since been investigated as vaccine candidates with the s377-588 fragment (fused to human igg fc) demonstrating the highest dpp4-binding affinity and inducing the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits [31] . another rbd fragment, s367-606, formulated with aluminum hydroxide (alum) has been investigated in a rhesus macaque model [32] . animals immunized with a higher dose of the vaccine (200/100/100 μg rrbd admixed with 1 mg of alum adjuvant) showed less severe pneumonia and decreased viral loads upon challenge with mers-cov, compared to a lower dose group [32] .recently though, a group in korea observed a high mutation rate in isolates of the mers-cov from several patients. it was seen that these mutations in the rbd of the s protein displayed reduced binding affinity to their host cell receptor, making the virus less virulent than the wild-type, but possibly also contributing to the virus evading the host immune system. [33] . therefore, shi et al. suggested epitope-based vaccine design to identify highly conserved region that can produce neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity against mers-cov. based on the in silico protein antigenic prediction and structure analysis, nucleocapsid (n) protein of mers-cov was the most probable antigenic protein and a number of putative lymphocytes epitope peptides were identified from the n protein [34] . nevertheless, these suggested epitopes have to undergo comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies for their efficient use as vaccines against mers-cov.the use of dna vaccines is based on the transfection of plasmid dna that encodes antigenic proteins into host cells and the subsequent expression of these foreign genes in order to induce a potent immune response against the disease of interest. undoubtedly, at first glance, nucleic acid immunization appears to be an attractive vaccine platform: fast vaccine development, a clean safety profile, and low production costs [35] . however, in spite of the promising data from preclinical animal studies, dna vaccines have not yet been fully successful in humans. for example, the dengue dna vaccine combined dna and protein vaccine vaccine research center, niaid dna s prime-s1 protein boost and s1 prime-s1 boost mouse and nhp [41] receptor-binding domain new york blood center, utmb, bcm s377-588 rbd fragment mouse, hdpp4 transgenic mouse and rabbit [31, 58•, 61] d1me 100 showed excellent anti-dengue cellular and humoral immune responses in non-human primates; however, it failed to produce neutralizing antibody in human subjects [36, 37] . research and development on mers-cov dna vaccines has been focused on the s protein by engineering plasmid dna that encoded full-length s protein sequences [38•] . a synthetic dna vaccine against mers-cov was studied in mice and large animal models (non-human primates-nhps and camels), and the results showed that the vaccine is capable of inducing s protein-specific neutralizing antibodies in these animals. intriguingly, the study revealed that vaccinated nhps were protected and failed to demonstrate any clinical or radiographic signs of pneumonia post mers viral challenge [38•] . in early 2016, the first-inhuman trial of mers vaccine has begun [39] , where 75 participants will receive the mers dna vaccine, gls-5300, co-developed by inovio pharmaceuticals and geneone life science inc. [40] . in an alternative approach, graham and co-workers proposed to combine a dna vaccine and the s1 subunit protein in a primeboost scheme. rhesus macaques immunized with spike dna vaccine followed by the s1 protein (adjuvanted with aluminum phosphate) yielded more neutralizing antibodies, showed fewer signs of pulmonary disease than animals vaccinated with the s1 protein only [41] .a mers-cov vaccine that targets camels has been developed using viral vector vaccine technology, with adenoviral vectors encoding the full-length mers-cov s protein or the s1 extracellular domain of s protein. pre-clinical studies showed vaccinated dromedary camels had mounted a neutralizing antibody response against mers-cov in vitro [42] . guo et al. highlighted that the intramuscular route for administering adenovirus-based vaccines (with mers-cov s protein) could affect the antigen-specific t cell response in immunized mice [43•] . lately, viral vector vaccines against mers-cov have been constructed using modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva). the mva-mers-s recombinant virus, which is genetically stable in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (cef) without the need for additional animal-derived components, was able to protect human dpp4-transduced mice against mers-cov challenge [44] . the phase i clinical trial in humans of this vaccine has been announced and is supported by the german center for infection research, difz [45] .novavax, in collaboration with a team from the university of maryland, has produced mers-cov full-length nanosized, amphiphilic spike protein aggregates using a recombinant baculovirus construct in sf9 cells. when formulated with alum, or, to an even greater extent, novavax' saponin-based matrix-m1 adjuvant, high titers of neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov (but the related sars-cov) were observed [46] . however, no plans for clinical trials have been made public yet [47] .another approach towards a mers vaccine is targeting camels, one of the reservoirs of the virus. according to a cross-sectional serological survey in all 13 provinces of saudi arabia (~10,000 individuals), the seroprevalence of mers-cov antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population [48] . scientists from the netherlands, germany, and spain have shown that a modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing the mers-cov spike protein (mva-s) conferred mucosal immunity in dromedary camels. using a prime-boost approach, dromedary camels were immunized intranasally as well as intramuscularly, and, after 3 weeks, challenged intranasally with mers-cov virus. while the animals showed the typical mild clinical symptoms of a mers infection in this species, a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus particles, as well as a reduction of viral rna in immunized camels was observed [49, 50•] . however, there is concern that this reduction might not be sufficient to disrupt the spread of the virus, or that the vaccination might not provide long-lasting immunity. in addition, since the disease does not cause any significant morbidity in camels, there is perceived reluctance among camel owners to have their animals vaccinated in the first place [51] . as an added benefit of the mva-s vaccine though, it was observed that the vaccination provided cross-protection against camelpox virus, which might the treatment more attractive to the animal owners.in order to characterize the viral pathogenesis and evaluate therapeutic options for mers-cov, researchers rely on an animal model mimicking the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. in contrast to the sars animal model, where aged mice displayed pathological changes post-infection [52] , mice infected with mers-cov did not show any clinical signs of infections, such as weight loss [53] . in addition, syrian hamsters and ferrets, which are known to be susceptible to sars-cov, failed to be infected by mers-cov [22, 54] .non-human primates (nhp) and common marmoset models have been tested for their suitability as mers-cov models. upon a combination of various inoculation routes (intratracheal, ocular, oral, and intranasal) using an infectious dose of mers-cov, rhesus macaques developed a transient lower respiratory tract infection and mild clinical disease without mortality [55] . on the other hand, mers-cov infected common marmosets developed progressive, severe pneumonia [56] . although nhps are sufficiently good models to study mers at different severity, working with nhps is costly. hence, establishing transgenic rodent animal models is crucial to move forward in the development of vaccines and therapeutic methods against mers-cov. by comparing small animal cell lines transfected with human and hamster dpp4 genes, it was observed that only humanized cell lines enabled mers-cov replication [57] . were fully permissive to mers-cov infection, resulting in weight loss and an acute inflammatory response within the lungs and brains of the animal [58•] . when these hcd26/dpp4 transgenic mice were immunized with mf59-adjuvanted rbd fragment (s377-588), fused to the fc fragment, they were protected after challenge with a high dose (100× ld 50 ) of the virus [60] . another hdpp4 transgenic mouse was recently created using an expression vector with either cytokeratin 18 (k18) or surfactant protein c (spc) promoters, with the spc-dpp4 transgenic mice exhibiting a milder disease phenotype [59] .emerging and re-emerging diseases with pandemic potential are a major driving force for vaccine development. for human coronaviruses, the pandemic outbreak of sars-cov necessitated the development of a blueprint for a global response to this type of threat. as mers-cov reaches the fourth year of its emergence, initial technological advances have enabled one dna-based vaccine to quickly enter phase i human trials. the process was arguably accelerated by key information for strategic vaccine development obtained during the prior sars-cov outbreak. nevertheless, the process of bringing a vaccine to the clinic remains lengthy and cumbersome, and with new infectious diseases shifting the focus away from mers, there is the risk that, just as before, the vaccine development process remains unfinished and is only picked up again when the next coronavirus emerges.conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.human and animal rights and informed consent this article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.the sars-cov-2, a member of family coronaviridae and the causative agent of covid-19 disease, has spread rapidly around the globe since the first outbreak in wuhan, china in december 2019. the world health organization (who) declared the outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern on 30 th january 2020 [1] [2] [3] [4] . despite the tremendous efforts to contain the virus, its spread is ongoing. though the majority of cases resolve spontaneously, some develop various fatal complications, including organ failure, septic shock, pulmonary edema, severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) [5] [6] [7] . before the current pandemic, highly pathogenic covs have hit the world as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronavirus in 2012. the sars-cov-2 has been identified as a β-coronavirus, and like sars-cov, it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors [8, 9] . recent data on genome sequencing of sars-cov-2 revealed that it shares approximately 79.6% similarity with sars-cov at the nucleotide level [9] , which varies between the different genes. sars-cov-2 contains a linear single-stranded positive-sense rna as genetic material that encodes for the spike (s), envelop (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) proteins [10] . the spike protein that binds to host cell receptors shares about 72% nucleotide similarity between these two [8, [11] [12] [13] . the s protein consists of two subunits s1 and s2, s1 interacts with the surface receptor and s2 helps in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, and subsequent entry of the virus into the host cells. different coronaviruses, depending upon the viral species, use different receptor binding domains (rbd) present on the s1 subunit to interact with host cell receptors [8, 9] . while rbd of mers-cov recognizes non-acetylated sialoside attachment receptors (human dipeptidyl peptidase 4) [14, 15] , sars-cov interacts with ace2 receptors [16] . however, sars-cov-2, as compared to sars-cov, contains different amino acids (five amino acids out of six are mutated) composition in its rbd that are crucial for receptor binding (ace2) with high affinity [17] , and has a functional polybasic furin site at s1-s2 boundary that may have a role in defining the viral infectivity and host range [18, 19] . the furin cleavage site is not reported in sars-cov, and its fusion to membrane involves either direct receptor-mediated fusion or receptor-mediated endocytosis [20] . the high-affinity binding of sars-cov-2 with ace2 receptor along with the presence of furin and tmprss2 (at s2') cleavage sites explain its rapid spread and strong ability for human to human transmission [21] .currently, there is no specific anti-viral medicine or vaccine available for the disease; however, many studies and clinical trials are being undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of various drugs and vaccine candidates [22] . as sars-cov-2 share significant similarities with sars and mers coronaviruses and use similar spike protein for receptor binding, the key information from the past vaccine studies with such similar viruses, may help accelerate the development of an effective therapy/vaccine against covid-19. [26, 27] . further, as with other rna viruses, these covs go through frequent recombination; therefore, a live attenuated vaccine carries the inherent risk of reversal to a virulent form and may pose a severe threat to human lives. ideally, a vaccine against a highly pathogenic virus, including covs should be able to generate a protective antibody response to the minimum antigen dose in a quick time with no adverse reactions. the covid-19 is spreading globally and infecting a large number of people due to the lack of any prophylactic measure. the demand for the vaccine, once available, will be overwhelming, and therefore; highly desirable for a potential vaccine to be able to induce immunity in a short time with the minimum quantity of the antigen required.this will make it affordable and help meet the high global demands [28, 29] . most of the above issues may be resolved by incorporating a suitable adjuvant in vaccine preparations, which will not only help in eliciting a robust immune response but also possibly reduce the antigen quantity and the need for multiple doses of vaccine. thus, the selection of an effective adjuvant becomes crucial for the development of an adjuvanted vaccine against covid-19. the past vaccine studies on similar covs with various adjuvant combinations may provide key information and help in picking adjuvants which possess a good safety profile and efficacy. therefore, in this review, we discuss the past adjuvanted vaccine studies and their outcomes, with similar covs which might be useful in developing an adjuvanted vaccine against covid-19. further, we briefly discuss the current progress in the development of adjuvanted vaccines against covid-19.aluminum hydroxide (alum) is the most commonly used agent as an adjuvant. the mechanism of its adjuvant action is complex and, so far, multiple hypotheses have been put forward to explain its mode of action [153] . it has been shown to act by depot formation at the site of injection allowing for a slow release of antigen. this prolongs the interaction time between antigen and antigen-presenting cells (apcs). further, it converts soluble antigens into particulate forms which are readily phagocytosed [30] . at the cellular level, aluminum hydroxide directly stimulates monocytes to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines activating t cells. activated th2 cells release il-4, which in turn can induce an increase in the expression of mhc class ii molecules on monocytes [31] . alum has been approved as an adjuvant in multiple licensed vaccines for human use in the majority of the countries worldwide (table. 1 (table. 2 (table. 3) [52, 53]mf59 is an oil-in-water type immunogenic adjuvant which consists of squalene and two surfactants, tween 80 and span 85. the mf59 is a safe, well-tolerated, and potent adjuvant that has been used in pandemic (focetria® and celtura®) and seasonal influenza (fluad®) vaccines in many countries (table. 1) [54, 55] . the inclusion of the mf59 adjuvant in the influenza vaccine has been reported to induce higher levels of antigen-specific antibody levels, higher hai titers (hemagglutination inhibiting), and better protection [56] [57] [58] . though it favors th2-type response like alum, mf59 activates more cd4 t cells and produces higher antibody tiers against the ha (hemagglutinin) of the influenza virus [59] . the mf59 has been tested as an adjuvant with many other vaccines against bacteria and viruses, including sars-cov.immunization with inactivated sars-cov vaccine adjuvanted with mf59 protected mice from challenge with the virus. the vaccine was able to elicit neutralizing antibodies after only 2 doses [60] . subunit vaccines based on s1 protein and rbd epitopes of mers-cov when co-administered with mf59, significantly augmented their immunogenicity resulting in strong induction of igg and neutralizing antibody response. the preparations protected the mice from lethal virus challenge [61] [62] [63] . many mers-cov rbd candidate vaccines adjuvanted with mf59 were developed and tested in mice. these vaccines elicited neutralizing antibodies and protected the hdpp4 transduced mice from the lethal challenge (table. 3) [63, 64] .montanide is a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion that contains mineral oil and surfactant from mannide monooleate family. it possesses immunostimulatory activity and works by the depot formation at the site of injection resulting in a slower release of antigens, local inflammation, and recruitment of antigen-presenting cells (apcs). it enhances antibody titer as well as cytotoxic t-lymphocyte (ctl) activity against the antigen it is formulated with [65, 66] . it is well tolerated in humans as compared to fia (freund's incomplete adjuvant) and has been tested in vaccines against aids (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), malaria, cancer, and influenza with varying degree of success [67] [68] [69] [70] . the combination of montanide isa-51 and cpg odn (oligodeoxynucleotide) has been used widely in many vaccines as the combination exerts a synergistic effect in boosting the th1 immune response. montanide isa-51 and cpg were used to emulsify the recombinant n protein of sars-cov. the formulation elicited strong th1 immune responses in mice and macaques [71] . the synthetic peptides of the spike protein of sars-cov formulated with an adjuvant montanide isa-51/cpg combination, elicited strong antibody titer in immunized animals that were capable of inhibiting sars-cov pseudovirus entry into hepg2 cells [72] . a dna vaccine encoding sars-cov n protein elicited a potent n protein-specific immune response when co-administered with montanide isa-51/cpg adjuvants [73] . the recombinant rbd of mers-cov when adjuvanted with montanide isa-51, induced high titers of serum antibodies that could neutralize the virus in cell culture [74] . the above pieces of evidence from the previous studies indicate that montanide isa-51 may increase the immunogenicity of the vaccines based on recombinant spike protein or synthetic peptides corresponding to rbd of s protein. further, it may be used along with cpg odn to induce an overall th1 biased immune response as a predominantly th2 immune response seems to cause ade on the viral challenge following immunization.these are oil-in-water adjuvant systems developed by glaxosmithkline (gsk). the as01(adjuvant system 01) is a liposome-based adjuvant that is consist of monophosphoryl lipid a (mpl) and a saponin molecule (qs-21), whereas as03 (adjuvant system 03) is an α-tocopherol and squalene-based adjuvant that has been used in gsk's a/h1n1 pandemic flu vaccine pandemrix®. the mpl is extracted from salmonella minnesota and qs-21 is purified from the bark of the south american tree quillaja saponaria molina. the mpl signals through tolllike receptor-4 (tlr4), which results in the activation of apcs and the production of cytokines and interferons (ifns). q-21 is reported to induce antigen-specific antibody response as well as cell-mediated immunity [75, 76] . when co-administered with recombinant sars-cov s protein, q-21 induced high titers of antigen-specific serum antibodies and protected from viral infection [77]. the as01 system has been used in recently developed rts,s/as01 malaria vaccine as well as tested in herpes zoster subunit vaccine, polyprotein hiv-1 vaccine and tuberculosis (mtb72f/as02 candidate) vaccine [78-81]. further, these adjuvants have also been used with inactivated sars-cov vaccine preparation in mice and hamsters. the as01 badjuvanted vaccine was slightly more immunogenic than the as03 a -adjuvanted vaccine. the vaccine in animals immunized with adjuvant provided better protection than the nonadjuvanted vaccine. importantly, the study did not observe enhance disease (ade) in the lungs or liver of hamsters following sars-cov challenge [82].delta inulin (di) is one of the many isoforms of inulin polysaccharide, which is stable at a higher temperature and has better immune potency. it activates the complement system and, when co-administered with antigen, helps mount a robust antigen-specific adaptive immune response consisting of both antibody and cell-mediated immunity (a th0 adjuvant property)[83-85]. a balanced enhancement of both th1 and th2 responses was observed when di (advax™) adjuvant was co-administered with an inactivated jev (japanese encephalitis virus) and influenza vaccines, which conferred the protection against the viral challenges [83, 86]. similarly, when recombinant spike protein or inactivated sars-cov vaccine was coadministered with delta inulin plus cpg oligonucleotide as adjuvants, the combination significantly enhanced serum neutralizing antibody titers without causing lung immunopathology, which was not the case when alum was used instead of delta inulin [45].tlrs are pattern recognition receptors (prrs) that identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps). these are present on cell surfaces as well as in endosomal compartments.interaction with the appropriate ligand triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines and type -1 ifns (interferons), which activates the cells of the innate and adaptive immune system many helminth-derived molecules have been shown to have potent immunostimulatory effects, including asp-1. the asp-1 is present in helminth onchocerca volvulus. a recombinant asp-1 (rov-asp-1) is reported to induce a mix of th1 and th2 responses when included with vaccine antigen; however, depending on the antigen, it could also activate a predominantly th1 type of immune response [100, 101] . therefore, it can be beneficial in a condition where bits of help from both the arms of the immune response is needed to clear the infection. further, the immune response induced against the asp-1 protein adjuvant did not affect its adjuvant activity on subsequent boost [102] . asp-1 has been shown to improve igg1 and igg2a antibody levels against commercially available vaccines such as influenza and rabies, and the adjuvant effect observed was higher than either traditional adjuvant alum, or mpl plus trehalose dicorynomycolate (tdm) [100, 103, 104] . a recombinant asp-1 protein when included with recombinant sars-cov spike protein antigen or an rbd containing vaccine, the combinations induced a mixed immune response with th1 dominance [100] . similar findings were observed when rov-asp-1 was used as an adjuvant with either s protein of sars-cov or hiv-1gp120 [105] . further, immunization with rbd of sars-cov plus rov-asp-1 in nhps resulted in a high titer of neutralizing anti-rbd antibodies with only low levels of anti-rov-asp-1 antibodies [102] .a complex of proteosomes with lps derived from shigella flexneri is named as protollin, whereas proteosomes itself contain hydrophobic outer membrane proteins derived from neisseria meningitides. protollin exerts its immunostimulatory effect via tlr2 and tlr4 signaling resulting in the production of cytokines, ifns, and the activation of apcs. intranasal administration of protollin with influenza antigen (split or recombinant ha) induced both serum igg and mucosal secretory iga that protected the mice from lethal virus challenge [106, 107] . further, its application was shown to be effective in reducing allergic asthma in a mouse model [108] , protective against the development of pneumonia in a murine model of shigella infection [109] and safe and well-tolerated in healthy adults [110] . protollin was an effective, safe, and immunogenic and induced protective antibody response consisting of both serum igg and mucosal iga in humans when administered intranasally with trivalent influenza vaccine [111] . protollin when administered intranasally with recombinant sars-cov s protein, induced significant levels of antigen-specific serum igg and mucosal iga antibodies as compared alum plus recombinant s protein administered via intramuscular route, and protected the mice from the live viral challenge [112] . therefore, as evidence reflects, protollin adjuvant appears to be safe and well-tolerated in human, more importantly, its ability to induce both serum and mucosal immunity might prove to be beneficial and should be explored further in sars-cov-2 vaccine development.many investigations have revealed an over activation of the immune system when an animal is challenged with the live virus following immunization. it causes immunopathological changes because of the excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) such as il-2, il-7, il-8, il-9, il-10, il-17, il-1β, g-csf, gm-csf, and tnfα. [154] [155] [156] ]. ade or immune enhancement occurs when a virus gains access into the immune cells while adhered to the antibodies, leading to an increase in infectivity and virulence of the virus. once inside the cells, which aren't the usual target, the virus multiplies and releases its progenies infecting more cells [157] . many viruses such as dengue, yellow fever, hiv, and covs have been reported to induce ade [158] . most pieces of evidence suggest viruses exploit the fc receptor (fcr) on the immune cells to gain entry while being attached to the antibody-binding site of the antibodies. the fc region of the antibody has a sequence that binds to complement system or immune cells expressing fcr receptors [159, 160] . the presence of high levels of nonneutralizing antibodies appears to be the primary reason that triggers ade [43] . other factors that contribute include low-affinity or sub-optimal levels of neutralizing antibodies and isotype of antibodies induced [42, 43,] . the presence of circulating antibodies against related epitopes from different strains or related viruses may also contribute to the enhancement of disease [161] . though data is conflicting, it has been observed in many inactivated virus vaccine recent data available on vaccine studies with sars-cov-2 in nhps appears promising. an inactivated vaccine (picovacc) adjuvanted with alum, elicited spike, and rbd proteinspecific neutralizing antibodies and protected the macaques on the viral challenge.importantly, the study did not observe ade in immunized animals (table. 4 ) [113] . the recombinant s1 protein of the virus fused with fc and adjuvanted with saponin microemulsion, when administered to macaques, induced a strong anti-s1 neutralizing antibodies [114] . the oxford university's vaccine candidate, chadox1 ncov-19 encoding the s protein of sars-cov-2, protected rhesus monkeys from developing pneumonia. the vaccine significantly reduced the viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue without causing disease enhancement in vaccinated monkeys [162] . further, a recently concluded phase i clinical trial with ad5-ncov (adenovirus type 5 vector) expressing s protein vaccine reported promising findings. the vaccine has been found to be safe, well-tolerated and induced both humoral and cellular immunity [165] . encouraging results have also been received from a recently concluded phase i clinical trial for the mers-cov vaccine [ table. glaxosmithkline has also teamed up with many firms such as xiamen innovax biotech and sanofi, to make its adjuvant technology available to the collaborators for their vaccine candidates [117] . both sanofi and xiamen innovax biotech are using gsk's as03 adjuvant (squalene-based) in their recombinant protein vaccine candidates. similarly, csl (commonwealth serum laboratories, australia) and seqirus, germany have tied up to use the mf59 adjuvant, which uses novel molecular-clam technology, in their covid-19 vaccine candidate [118] . novavax, (usa), on the other hand, is using its proprietary matrix-m™ adjuvant for their vaccine candidate (nvx-cov2373), consisting of nanoparticles carrying sars-cov-2 spike protein antigens [119] . another biopharma company, soligenix, inc., has collaborated with btg speciality pharmaceutics. soligenix will use a novel vaccine adjuvant (covaccine ht) from btg, with its covid-19 vaccine candidate [120]. covaccine ht is an oil-in-water emulsion consisting of sucrose fatty acid sulfate easter (sfase) and squalene, which has been reported to induce both humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity [121, 122] . ibio has signed up an agreement with infectious disease research institute (idri, seattle, us) in an effort to utilize their novel adjuvants such as gla (glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant), a synthetic analogue of the mpl, for its sars-cov-2 vlp vaccine development [123, 124] .the experience and knowledge generated from the past vaccine studies with different adjuvants the adjuvanted vaccine in mice induced neutralizing antibodies; however, also pr though it did not affect its adjuvanticity the vaccine also produced significant ne but did not produce much antibodies aga 17 rov-asp-1 sars-cov s peptide vaccine mice demonstrated that rov-asp-1 was a bet mpl + tdm. it enhanced production th the adjuvanted vaccine produced high a peptide 18 protollin sars-cov spike protein mice the adjuvanted vaccine elicited high lev serum. the antibodies were neutralizing antigen-specific iga levels. the vaccine challenge. j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f various other dna vaccines including aids [34] , malaria and influenza [35] are also under human trial.dna vaccine made up of plasmid dna encoding protein from pathogens have been demonstrated for inducing both t and b cell responses, after showing the similar effects of live viruses, that antigenic proteins are produced endogenously and presented efficiently by mhc class i, thus help in inducing cd8+ t-cell responses [36] . further as the dna vaccines are simple, stable, safe and can be easily produced it can be possible option to the use of live vaccines [36] . there are numbers of sars-cov proteins viz. s [24, 28, [37] [38] [39] [40] , m [41] and n [42, 43] proteins reported to induce cellular and humoral responses have been utilized as dna vaccine candidates [40] . in a study dna vaccine associated expression of s protein have generated both t-cell and neutralizing antibody responses, and lowered the replication of sars-cov in the respiratory tract this manifested that protective efficacy to the s gene in mice was antibody mediated not t-cell dependent [24] . further in a study s plasmid improved the gene expression of spike (s) protein by heterologous viral rna export elements and protection in mouse model [39] , but their role have not been recorded in case of other in vivo models. vaccination of mice with multi-epitope dna vaccine has elicited specific antibody response to two candidate epitopes, s(437-459) and m(1- 20) which reduced the virulence of sars-cov in-vitro, but there was no report on the protective efficacy [41] . in another study mice immunized with n-dna vaccine induced nspecific antibody response and tc-cell activity [42, 44] , moreover a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) and cd8(+) ctl responses to n protein was observed [44] . in an another study of n-dna vaccination, expression of n protein and its linkage to lamp for better presentation of mhc ii has amplified memory response [45] . moreover vaccination j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f of c57bl/6 mice with naked crt/n dna for improved mhc class i presentation not only induced n-specific humoral and cellular immunity but also considerably reduced the titer of challenging vaccinia virus against the cells expressing n protein [43] . in addition to other animal models, an n-dna vaccine candidate has also been evaluated in hla-transgenic mice that induced a specific cd8+ t-cell response [46] . besides the expression of s and n proteins, m protein have also been reported to be expressed in mice and found to induce neutralizing antibodies, human monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic t-lymphocyte response [47] . in a comprehensive study of dna vaccine using different gene fragments (s-, m-and n), m dna vaccine was reported with the highest cellular immunity in mice [40] . although dna vaccines works efficiently during preclinical stages, but their efficacy in field conditions are quite unsatisfactory and have lower immunogenicity [48] , as compared to other vaccines such as inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines and need further improvement regarding the efficacy. to confront this problem different prime-boost approaches such as heterologous prime or boost with proteins, inactivated viral vaccine candidates or viral vectors have been constructed [28, 41, [49] [50] [51] .there are various practices mostly the traditional one that has been approached to make a vaccine, but these methods on an average takes, 16 years as in the case from human papilloma virus, to rotavirus. the development of a protein-based vaccine requires growth of the viruses and its protein purification, which is a lengthy process and may take several years.to make an effective and new generation vaccine against this fast spreading virus, instead of protein, mrna vaccination strategy can be a better approach [52] . the mrna j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f vaccine manifests the immune responses similar to natural infection and provides a short synthetic viral mrna, which is then used by the host to produce the antigen proteins. since the mrna used in vaccine after injected can't integrate into the host's genome, they are safe to use. furthermore, they are safer than inactivated or protein based vaccines because they are free from the risk of protein contamination or the injected virus to become active.the huge benefit of mrna vaccine is that it can circumvent the hassle associated with the purification of viral proteins that saves the time from months to years used in standardization and scaling up the mass production [52] . so far there is no approved rna considering safety efficacy, subunit vaccines involving pure antigens are said to be advantageous, as the constituent only includes synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins that expresses only particular fragments of immunogen, excluding the participation of contagious viruses. in addition to this, subunit vaccines are less prone to generate the side effects at the site of inoculation. due to stable conditions and definite fragments of pathogen, subunit vaccines achieve reliable production. due to all these qualities of subunit vaccines are helpful in making it an interesting candidate for vaccine. a number of structural proteins comprising spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) are expressed by sars-cov that may act as antigens to activate neutralizing antibodies and generate defensive response.spike protein (s) of virus performs significant part in entering the host [57] . the cov-rna genome is allowed to go inside the cells of host through the early interactions of s1 domain to its receptor in the host i.e. pp 4 in mers-cov and ace2 in sars-cov, followed by the viral and host membrane fusion facilitated by the s2 segment. to develop vaccines based on cov subunit, s proteins are the preferred candidate, because s proteins have sites for binding of receptor as well as for membrane fusion; vaccines based on s protein are likely to j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f activate antibodies that prevent the binding of virus and later fusion of membranes as well thereby counteracting infection of virus [58] . s glycoprotein of sars-cov which is shown to bind the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), is an interesting candidate to target for both vaccine and therapeutic improvement [32, 59] . this practice is robustly encouraged by the discovery that illustrates the infectivity by sars-cov is powerfully counteracted by human mab that binds to s protein through n-terminal and thereby prevents binding of receptor by hindering the formation of syncytia [60] . on the other hand, few epitopes that are not neutralizing are also present in the immmunopredominant sites of the s protein of sars-cov [61] that could elicit the immune responses which might be harmful [62] . for that reason, the identification and elimination of such epitopes in s protein is obligatory. moreover, the s protein have been reported to produce serum neutralizing antibodies and protected african green monkeys and mice challenged with sars-cov [24, 63] . s-ectodomain proteins of full length merged with/ without s or sfoldon i.e. fold on trimeric motif, may induce precise antibody response and neutralizing antibody thus causing protection of the vaccinated mice to sars-cov infection [64] .besides this, s protein associated with sars-cov is also shown to be responsible for eliciting responses by t-cell (cd4+ and cd8+ ) [49] .rbd is a segment in the centre of s1 subunit of s protein which is ~193 aa residues and binds to receptors present in the target cells. it has been illustrated that antisera of sars infected person and that of animals inoculated with inactivated sars-cov, effectively responded with rbd [65, 66] . a lot of the neutralizing antibodies were removed of these antisera by rbd through antibodies absorption, while the antibodies specific to rbd, having effective neutralizing action were obtained from these antisera [66] . it has also been j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f represented that the rbd vaccinated mice and rabbits produces counteracting antibodies in high number against the sars-cov having 50% neutralizing titers at a >1:10,000 serum dilution [67] . as compared to s protein of full length, high number of neutralizing antibodies were induced with rbd [24, 67, 68] because in contrast to s protein with full length, no immunodominant regions are present in rbd that elicits antibodies that are not neutralizing. to prevent the infection from sars-cov, with different genotypes rbd containing recombinant proteins or vectors that encodes rbd could be used. thus, the generation of antibodies targeting the rbd subunit of sars-cov-2 would be an important preventive and treatment strategy that can be tested further in suitable models before clinical trials.besides the above mentioned proteins, expression of various other proteins have also been reported on the virion surface with the production of antibodies in sars patients serum [69] , further these proteins can also be evaluated to check the protective efficacy against sars-cov. for instance, counteracting action of the antibodies towards m proteins has also been reported [70] . membrane or m protein plays an essential role in upholding the configuration of viral envelope [71] and m protein carries out this by making interactions with different cov proteins [72] , incorporating golgi complex into novel virions [71] , and stabilizing proteins of the nucleocapsid [71] . investigations on animal cov vaccines have reported that the nucleocapsid protein (n) of cov could serve as additional target for the development of vaccine [73] . even though the antibodies to n proteins of cov does not have mechanism to neutralize the virus, but generation of cov-restricted cd8+ t cells has j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f been reported [74] [75] [76] , consequently providing protection subsequent to infection in animals [77] therefore, this suggest that in vivo defense could be offered by the protein by eliciting cell-mediated response [74, 78] . research have shown that precise igg antibodies, as well as subtypes igg1 and igg2a were induced when freund's adjuvant was conjugated with sars-cov n protein that was plant expressed while, conjugating adjutants like cysteinephosphate-guanine (cpg) and montanide isa-51 with n protein that was e. coli-expressed, results in induction of definite igg antibodies toward a th1 (igg2a)-type response in mice [79, 80] . however, the conserved n protein across cov families implies that it is not a suitable candidate for vaccine development, and the antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov-2 do not provide immunity to the infection [81] .recombinant vector vaccines can be defined as live, dividing viruses that are genetically manipulated to harbor some additional pathogenic gene, coding for foreign proteins, responsible for eliciting immune response [82] . recombinant vector vaccines are highly efficient in triggering an immune response as they can infect cells and sustain in the body for quite a long time and can react to antigen-presenting cells directly. also viral proteins in such vaccines can act like adjuvant [83] , thereby enhancing immune response, resulting in generating more antibodies and long-term immunity, and reducing the dose of antigen adenovirus based delivery systems have several benefits including their ease of administration by oral or nasal route, their non-pathogenicity in humans [84] , particularly for mutants with compromised replication [85] . defending power of ad-vectored vaccines against sars-cov was first demonstrated in rhesus macaques in 2003 [86] . they were immunized with three ad5-sars-cov ad-based vector constructs expressing genes for n, s and m proteins. the vaccine induced antibody reaction against spike s1 fragment, production of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies and t-cell proliferation against the n protein [86] . in a similar study when ad vector expressing sars n-protein was used to vaccinate c57bl/6 strain mice, surprisingly no neutralizing antibodies were produced but sars-cov-specific ifn-γ secretion and t-cell production was detected [84] . when 129s6/svev strain mice was co-immunized with 2 ad vector constructs containing genes coding for sars-cov s and n proteins by either nasal or muscular route, it suggested that former induced ig a and effectively checks sars-cov reproduction in nasal and alveolar tissues while the later works by proliferating neutralizing antibodies [87] . a number of studies analyzing efficacy of these vaccines have been done in ferrets, being it the only model that resembles most of the symptoms of human patients including fever, transmission by respiratory route, discharge of virus from upper airways and lung injuries [88] , [89] .when ferrets were primed with adenoviral construct coding s-protein and boosted with a different adenovirus from chimpanzee, a significant reduction in viral load and other clinical j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f symptoms was observed [90] . targeting that serotype to which humans are naïve is the focal point of recent adenoviral constructs. for this chimpanzee adenovirus (chadox1) is a promising candidate owing to its lack of persistent immunity in humans [91] and superior safety status. presently, a potential mers-cov vaccine named mers001 is at clinical trial, having chadox1coding for s-protein of mers-cov [92] . but restricted cloning ability, limited host range [93] and pre-existent immunity against adenovirus in significant proportion of human population [83, 94] are some of their limitations which makes their animal testing challenging and retards their clinical use as a vector for vaccine designing.the poxvirus constructs are potent vectors due to better stability, greater insert size, easy production, cytoplasmic gene expression and capacity to elicit long-termed cell mediated and humoral immunity [83] . in a study, replication-compromised poxvirus vector, modified vaccinia ankara (mva) strain, coding for sars-cov s protein, generate neutralizing antibody response and reduced viral load in the upper airways of mice [63] . mva constructs expressing entire s protein are potent vaccine target [95] [96] [97] . an additional vaccine target is mva-mers-s, presently in phase i clinical trial at university medical center hamburg-eppendorf, germany [98] . studies involving relatively conserved n protein expressing mva in mice generated cd8 + cells [99] .newcastle disease virus (ndv) viral-vector contain mers-cov s protein which generated neutralizing antibody response in balb/c mice and bactrian camels [100] . although ndv j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f vaccines elicited vigorous immune response, but also have many limitations namely, persistent immunity against ndv, higher threat of pathogenesis, low viral titer production, and possible carcinogenesis [101] .since viral vector-based vaccines could be quickly constructed and used without an adjuvant, development of such vaccines might be possible in sars-cov-2 because rbd of s-protein has been identified as a neutralizing epitope [102] . so this epitope could be actively pursued for the development of viral vector based vaccines. [109] . thus, deletion of the structural e gene may prove to be the first step in the field of developing a live-attenuated vaccine against sars-cov. moreover, nsp-1 gene deleted cov mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) has also been reported with high efficacy thus can also be used for developing a sars-attenuated vaccine [110] . two studies related to gene deletion and attenuation effects suggests that removal of orfs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b or 9b results in very little and no viral replication during in-vitro and in vivo conditions [108, 111] . however the outcomes of the studies conducted so far are not so convincing because it takes longer time to create non infectious clones of coronavirus due to larger genome size and also requires extensive safety testing [112] . furthermore, reversion of the pathogen to the virulent form can be protected using gene replacement knockout strategy that can be safer as compared to the lines developed by other means like chemical treatment and irradiation etc.inactivated virus vaccines also known as the wkv (whole killed virus) vaccines represent a pathogen whose ability to infect and replicate has been ceased, consequently making it sterile but retaining its ability to act as an immunogen, so that the immune system could still work if such a pathogen is injected into a host. inactivated vaccines are prepared by neutralizing the pathogen as a whole by chemicals or by heat and radiation. it is thought that inactivated vaccines can be prepared with much less effort which makes them one of the attractive types of vaccines prepared in the market today. these vaccines work by exposing the same epitopes which a virus otherwise would have presented, thus eliciting an immune response. when sera of the infected person were tested, presence of antibodies against minimum eight different proteins suggests the presence of diverse moieties exposed on the membrane of the pathogen [69] . in order to search targets for the protective antibodies further investigations has been done and it is found that additional structural proteins that can be targeted are encoded by (open reading frame) orfs (3a, 6, 7a and 7b), envelope (e), spike (s), and matrix (m) [49, [113] [114] [115] [116] . by interpreting these data we can assume that multiple targets are present for the protective antibodies. 3cl, nucleocapsid (n), s, m etc. are the proteins against which the antibodies were induced when a mice was vaccinated with sars-cov [117] . despite many advantages there are some limitations for the development of inactivated vaccines viz. budding pathogens in bulk (biosafety level 3) and complete sterilization of the grown pathogens. successful sterilization of sars-cov, in bulk has been demonstrated with the help of uv radiations [118] . during the last two decades many investigators have demonstrated that inactivated whole sars-cov can induce sars-cov neutralizing antibody [65, 117, [119] [120] [121] [122] but there have no study been reported against the live sars-cov challenge. a study in balb/c mice, wkv vaccine was observed to journal pre-proof j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f provide resistance by ceasing the multiplication of pulmonary sars-cov, however immunological responses are yet to be verified [123] . further, β-propiolactone inactivated wkv sars-cov (tor-2 strain) reported to be a potential vaccine candidate as it induced neutralizing antibodies and was able to minimize the virus load in the pulmonary tract of the mouse model [87] . however, there are less evidences of the mouse models being infected by such a diseases clinically, thus studying models where this strain is more virulent and sustainable is imperative. so wkv has also been tested in ferrets, a model which show significant lung pathology and clinical sign [89, 90] . formalin inactivated urbani strain of sars-cov did not demonstrated strong immune response [124] but β-propiolactone inactivated wkv sars-cov induced significant neutralizing antibody and reduced virus replication in respiratory tract of ferrets [89] . rhesus monkeys were also been tested for the formaldehyde inactivated sars-cov vaccines and shown to be safe and immunogenic [125] . wkv sars-cov has also been tested in humans and found to be safe and elicited sars-cov specific neutralizing antibodies, however the efficiency the vaccine in humans yet to be reported [126] . these data suggested that wkv vaccines are safe and they are able to induce sars-cov specific neutralizing antibodies so inactivated viral vaccines could also be evaluated as potential vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2. might be considered as a good vaccine antigen because it induces neutralizing antibodies that prevent host cell attachment and infection [127] [128] [129] . further nucleic acid based vaccine, showed the most advance platform in response to emerging pathogens. dna vaccine was the first vaccine candidate that entered in clinical trial (nct02809443) [130] less than 1-year after the zika virus outbreak. another nucleic acid-based vaccine, m-rna vaccine can be considered as advanced vaccine technology because of its stability and protein translation efficiency so that it could induce robust immune responses [52, 131] .currently there are various biopharmaceutical companies or academic sectors are in the race to develop the prophylactic sar-cov-2 vaccine by using several platforms including mrna, dna, vaccinia or adenoviral vector and recombinant protein [112, 132] . in order to make effective sar-cov-2 vaccine possible, target antigen(s)/nucleotide identification, immunization route, immune protection, suitable animal models, scalability, production facility, target product profile (tpp), outbreak forecasting and target population etc. are important parameters. as it is already known for some of the recent epidemics (zika and ebola) whose successful vaccine has not been developed yet. lesson-learned from these epidemics in order to speed up the available vaccine during ongoing outbreak, preclinical studies of sar-cov-2 vaccine candidates may need to be performed in parallel with clinical trials. but in reality, sars-cov-2 vaccines will not be available for another 12- middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) was first isolated in september 2012 from a patient in saudi arabia who presented two months earlier with severe acute respiratory infection and acute renal failure [1] . retrospective testing of samples in jordan identified earlier cases from a nosocomial outbreak in april 2012 [2] . although the majority of mers-cov cases (∼75%) have occurred in saudi arabia, 25 other countries have confirmed imported or autochthonously transmitted cases ( fig. 1) [3, 4] . the most recent and largest outbreak outside of saudi arabia occurred in south korea in may 2015 [5] , raising concern for an eruption of regional outbreaks or accelerated global spread, similar to the phylogenetically related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) that killed nearly a thousand people a decade earlier [6] . although the definitive host for mers-cov has not yet been established, closely related coronaviruses have been isolated from bats across wide geographic areas [7] [8] [9] . mounting evidence has strongly implicated dromedary camels as the intermediate animal reservoir, as serological surveys throughout the middle east and north africa have demonstrated them to have a high prevalence of mers-cov binding or neutralizing abs [10] [11] [12] [13] . additionally, outbreak investigations have suggested epidemiologic linkage between farm camels and human cases [14] .mers-cov is a spherical, enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense rna beta-coronavirus [1, 15] . its genome contains a replicase * tel.: +13015003600. locus at the 5 end and codes for structural proteins toward the 3 end. the most immunogenic of the viral proteins is spike (s), a trimeric, envelope-anchored, type i fusion glycoprotein that interfaces with its human host cognate receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), to mediate viral entry [16, 17] . s comprises two subunits: s1, which contains the receptor-binding domain and determines cell tropism; and s2, the location of the cell fusion machinery. although dpp4 has a broad tissue distribution, most of the clinical manifestations of mers-cov can be attributed to its localization to the lower respiratory tract [18, 19] . much like other coronaviruses, mers-cov can also cause significant dysfunction of the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic systems. mers-cov is distinct, though, in its tendency to cause greatest harm to older individuals with concurrent comorbidities of one or more of these organ-systems [20, 21] .despite past efforts to develop coronavirus countermeasures in response to the sars-cov pandemic, there are currently no prophylactic or therapeutic interventions of proven efficacy for mers-cov or any other coronavirus infection. although combination treatment with ribavirin and interferons were shown to improve clinical outcomes in mers-cov-infected non-human primates (nhps), treatment was initiated very soon after viral challenge (∼8 h) and results have not been replicated in humans [22] . in fact, no experimental interventions have demonstrated appreciable benefit in acutely ill patients in a consistent or controlled manner. rapidly scaled treatments based on naturally occurring neutralizing antibodies such as convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin, on the other hand, have demonstrated mortality reductions for other respiratory infections and may hold promise for mers-cov as well [23] . their development, however, is limited by logistical challenges, local technical capacity, and donor supply. supportive management, adapted from guidelines developed for sars-cov, has thus far been the mainstay of mers-cov treatment.the global will to develop a coronavirus vaccine faded in the aftermath of sars-cov pandemic but has since gained renewed momentum in the face of the current mers-cov outbreak. previous approaches to coronavirus vaccine development were broad and included whole-inactivated and live-attenuated viruses, recombinant vectors and protein subunits, as well as dna and rna based platforms [6] . most developers based their immunogen designs on the s surface glycoprotein, the primary target for neutralizing antibodies during any natural coronavirus infection. a number of preclinical and clinical studies showed that the sars-cov s1 protein subunit, and specifically the rbd at its core, could serve as a dominant target for neutralizing antibodies in mice, non-human primates, and humans [24] . s1, therefore, became the basis for a number of promising sars-cov vaccine candidates.the s1 protein subunit and rbd have also been the basis for several mers-cov vaccine candidates (fig. 2 ) [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . resolution of rbd crystal structures alone or in complex with the dpp4 receptor [25, 30, 31] have informed the design of immunogens that have been expressed either as recombinant protein fragments or conjugates to the fragment crystallizable (fc) region of human antibodies. both types of constructs, in formulation with aluminum salt or oil-in-water adjuvants, have elicited neutralizing antibodies of high potency across multiple viral strains. despite their demonstrated immunogenicity in animal models and anticipated safety in humans, rbd or s1-subunit based vaccine candidates are limited in their epitope breadth. although the coronavirus genomes are not as variable as other rna viruses, the rbd is the most mutable region, containing mutation sites that define antibody escape variants [25, 32] . thus, vaccine candidates that elicit a more diverse antibody repertoire as well as a robust cellular immune response may offer the advantage of broader and more durable protection.full-length s used as an immunogen could at least increase the breadth of the antibody response; however, it has been difficult to express, and may require additional work to produce a stable soluble trimer of the s ectodomain. investigators at the university of maryland, in collaboration with novavax, inc., have overcome this problem through the development of s rosettes that are stable and immunogenic in murine models [33] . vaccines that mimic natural infection, such as live-attenuated viruses or recombinant viral vectors, may elicit even more robust immunity. live attenuated viruses have historically been among the most immunogenic platforms available, as they have the capacity to present multiple antigens across the viral life cycle in their native conformations. although a live-attenuated mers-cov has yet to be tested, one has been constructed and has the potential to be protective [34] . however, manufacturing live-attenuated viruses requires containment in a biosafety level 3 or 4 facility. additionally, live-attenuated viruses carry the hazards of inadequate attenuation or reversion to wild type form and causing disseminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. given that moderately immunocompromised adults with co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease have suffered the most severe mers-cov disease, these individuals may comprise a target population for immunization, thus making a live-attenuated virus vaccine a less viable option. replication competent viral vectors could pose a similar threat for disseminated disease in the immunosuppressed. replication deficient vectors, however, avoid that risk while maintaining the advantages of native antigen presentation, elicitation of t cell immunity and the ability to express multiple antigens. to date, two recombinant vector platforms-modified although replication deficient vectors are relatively safe and immunogenic, their ability to deliver genetic material for expression could be impeded by pre-existing or developing immunity to the vector itself. one way to overcome this limitation is by administering different vectors in a so-called prime-boost immunization regimen. as this strategy has been effective for other pathogens, it is likely that the same success could be recapitulated for mers-cov. the use of more than one type of platform or antigen in a single vaccine also increases the likelihood of inducing a broad repertoire of antibodies with diverse mechanisms of viral neutralization. one vaccine regimen developed at the us national institutes of health is based on full-length s dna and a truncated s1 subunit glycoprotein and has elicited neutralizing antibodies in mice directed at both the s1-within and outside the rbd-and s2 subunits. immunization with these constructs also protected nhps from severe lung disease after intra-tracheal challenge with mers-cov [25] . a dnaonly vaccine, expressing multiple antigens, has also been developed by inovio pharmaceuticals and geneone life science inc. and has been advanced to a phase i first-in-human trial.each of the vaccine candidates that have been mentioned is being developed for prophylactic use. however, as the total number of cases (>1600) [3, 4] and reproductive rate (∼0.7) of mers-cov are both relatively low [39] , it will be difficult to define the target populations for vaccination that would support the investment in manufacturing and advanced product development. also, with such low incidence and lack of robust animal models, it would be difficult to achieve a vaccine efficacy result that would be sufficient to support licensure. human mabs, on the other hand, could be used without as much discrimination in an outbreak setting for post-exposure prophylaxis and early treatment. the advantages of mabs over polyclonal antibodies (administered through convalescent plasma or hyperimmune globulin) are their higher potency, greater specificity, more extensive pre-licensing evaluation and consequently improved safety profile. additionally, mabs can help define immunogenic epitopes through crystallographic analysis, thereby providing atomic level detail for the design of better immunogens. however, the timeline for mab development may be longer and potentially cost more than some vaccines.despite requirements for greater upfront investment, several groups have developed highly potent mabs that are currently being advanced through pre-clinical stages of testing (fig. 3) . some have been isolated from immunized animals (mice/humanized mice/nhps) [25, 40] , while others have been identified from either an antibody human phage library [41] [42] [43] [44] or memory b cells of infected and recovered human survivors [45] . almost all of the mabs that have been reported target the spike rbd. it is likely that mabs directed at other sites on the spike glycoprotein have been recovered but are not as potent neutralizers. most of those that have been published bind to recombinant spike with picomolar affinity and neutralize mers-cov pseudovirus at a half maximal inhibitory concentration (ic 50 ) of 0.1 mcg/l or less. additionally, some have demonstrated protective efficacy in pre-and post-exposure prophylaxis animal models [44, 45] . the successes thus far in isolating potent and protective mabs may prove useful for therapeutic development where the target population is well defined. it may prove more challenging to advancing these products to licensure and fullscale production at affordable costs for the purpose of prophylaxis in as of yet undefined populations.the vaguely defined epidemiology of mers-cov has complicated the design and implementation of appropriate public health countermeasures. most transmission events have occurred either in the setting of household clusters or nosocomial outbreaks [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . it is also likely that the virus has been introduced multiple times into human populations from a large zoonotic reservoir, i.e. dromedary camels. given the broad distribution and ownership of camels in the arabian peninsula where most cases have occurred, a targeted vaccine campaign may prove difficult. as the outbreak in the republic of korea revealed, patients and workers in the same healthcare facility as an infected patient are at high risk for secondary acquisition. an optimal strategy may be to use vaccines in conjunction with stringent infection control practices in hospitals where mers-cov cases are being treated.the epidemiologic link of mers-cov between bats, camels, and humans presents an opportunity for a veterinary vaccine to interrupt the transmission cycle. a successful precedent for this so-called "onehealth" approach toward mitigating human disease with a veterinary vaccine exists in the example of equivac ® , a hendra virus vaccine developed solely for horses [52] . although hendra virus is even more rare than mers-cov, it is highly fatal with no treatment other than intensive supportive management. in 2012, a protein subunit vaccine was licensed and rolled-out in australia, where all outbreaks of the virus occurred. since that time, the incidence in horses has fallen precipitously and no human cases have been detected [53] . a similar strategy may be applicable to mers-cov; however, a veterinary vaccination in this context would be deployed solely for the sake of protecting humans, as the virus causes only mild upper respiratory illness in camels. safety and reduction in viral shedding would have to be demonstrated in immunization, challenge and transmission studies of camel or camelid populations, one of which has shown efficacy [54] .one of the primary challenges to developing countermeasures to mers-cov is the lack of an appropriate animal model that recapitulates the natural history of human disease. much of the difficulty originates from the absence of the virus's cognate dpp4 receptor. one group approached this problem by successfully transducing mice with an adenoviral vector expressing human dpp4 [55] . although more relevant than a standard murine model, transient transduction of the desired protein may result in inconsistent tissue expression of adenovirus antigens. agrawal et al. made an important advance with the development of a transgenic mouse model that demonstrated productive, disseminated mers-cov infection [56] . although rhesus macaques do not manifest full clinical disease, they develop a transient lower respiratory infection that can be quantified and evaluated by computed tomography. investigators at the nih rocky mountain laboratories (rml) and integrated research facility (irf) have also independently been developing potentially lethal marmoset models that could be used for the evaluation of vaccines, mabs and therapeutics [57] .as mers-cov vaccines-both active and passive-are developed and tested, not only will more relevant animal models be required, but there will also be a need for a more detailed understanding of the epidemiology, immunology, and pathogenesis of the virus. in the aftermath of the west african ebola virus epidemic and in the face of the current zika virus outbreak, the global health community has coalesced around the realization that a multi-faceted plan is required to quickly and efficiently respond to global public health emergencies. the world health organization is currently developing a blueprint by which that preparation and response can follow, with mers-cov highlighted as a case study. although mers-cov still causes relatively few cases in a limited geographic distribution, its high case fatality and sudden outbreak in in korea have proven it to be a pathogen of public health concern. the concentration of the epidemic to saudi arabia also raises the specter of international spread every year during hajj, one of the largest mass gathering events in the world. ultimately, the development of a safe and effective vaccine for mers-cov may not yield its greatest benefit for the current epidemic but for the knowledge gained in creating a platform for combating coronaviruses as a whole.the opinions expressed herein are those of the authors and should not be construed as official or representing the views of the us department of defense or the department of the army.camel flu, or more commonly known as the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), is a respiratory disease caused by mers-coronavirus (mers-cov). mers-cov was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 . as of february 2019, 27 countries worldwide have reported cases of mers-cov infection, with 2,374 reported viral infection and 823 associated deaths, which corresponds to ∼35% fatality in identified cases (world health organization [who] , 2019b), although the actual fatality rate of the viral infection is most likely below 35% due to some unidentified, mild, or asymptomatic cases. majority of these cases occurred in saudi arabia, amounting to 1,983 of reported cases, with 745 associated deaths or ∼37.5% fatality (world health organization [who] , 2019a).majority of the identified mers-cov cases are nosocomially acquired via direct close contact with infected patients (chowell et al., 2015; cauchemez et al., 2016) , whereas cases of zoonotic transmission from dromedary camels to humans were reported primarily in saudi arabia, where human-camel interaction is frequent (gossner et al., 2016) . hitherto, no specific treatments and vaccines are available for mers-cov infections. although mers-cov is currently not listed as a potential pandemic threat, a recent outbreak in south korea which demonstrated virus emergence in second and third generation contacts, has immediately raised concern that multiple mutations of mers-cov might cause enhanced human-to-human transmission (wang et al., 2015b; oh et al., 2018) . recently, mers-cov was added to the niaid's pathogen priority list as category c priority pathogens due to its potential applications in biological warfare (du et al., 2016b) . preventive measures against mers-cov infection, particularly vaccine development, are crucial to avoid deadly and unexpected future pandemics.middle east respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, the causative agent of mers, is a positive sense, single-stranded rna betacoronavirus which belongs to the family of coronaviridae. its viral genome is about 30 kb in length, flanked by a 5'terminal cap and 3'-poly(a) tail scobey et al., 2013) . mers-cov genome contains at least 10 open reading frames (orfs), which encodes for 4 structural proteins: spike (s) protein, envelope (e) protein, membrane (m) protein, nucleocapsid (n) protein, 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16), and 5 accessory proteins (orf3, orf4a, orf4b, orf5, and orf8b) du et al., 2017) . of all these viral proteins, s and n proteins are of particular interest in the development of vaccines against mers-cov, although other proteins such as e protein and nsp16 are potential immunogens as live attenuated vaccines (almazan et al., 2013; menachery et al., 2017) .two viral proteins of mers-cov, s and n proteins, were demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and capable of eliciting t-cell responses. however, only s protein was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies, the critical effectors against mers-cov . notably, n protein had also been proposed to be a potential protective immunogen for both neutralizing antibodies and t-cell immune responses through in silico approaches (shi et al., 2015) . despite the prediction, no biological data have been presented thus far. another potential b cell epitope of the mers-cov e protein was identified recently using in silico methods, yet similarly, no biological data were presented (xie et al., 2018) . therefore, most of the mers-cov vaccine candidates are still based on the full length or part of the s protein.ideally, an effective mers-cov vaccine is required to induce both robust humoral and cell-mediated immunities, particularly antibody responses are crucial for the survival of the vaccinated hosts (du et al., 2016b) . previous studies indicated that the level of serum neutralizing antibodies correlated positively with the reduction of lung pathogenesis, which increased the survival of animals challenged with mers-cov zhang et al., 2016) . in general, most of the potential mers-cov vaccine candidates were able to elicit systemic antibody responses, producing high titer of serum igg upon immunization, but many failed to generate sufficient mucosal immunity unless the vaccines were administered via a mucosal or intranasal route. activation of mucosal immunity is heavily dependent on the route of immunization, and this is a common challenge in vaccine development for many respiratory pathogens (ma et al., 2014a; guo et al., 2015) . pre-existing neutralizing mucosal antibodies are important as a first line of defenses against mers-cov infection . all neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccines based on s protein could bind to the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the protein thereby inhibiting viral internalization and membrane fusion (du et al., 2017) . little is known about the memory b-cell responses against mers-cov, apart from a recent study which demonstrated the persistence of anti-mers-cov antibodies in mers survivors up to 34 months (payne et al., 2016) . on the other hand, antibody responses against another closely related coronavirus, sars-cov, were not persistent, whereby a 6-year follow-up study did not detect memory b-cell responses in sars survivors (tang et al., 2011) . it is likely that some of the b-cells differentiate into mers-covspecific memory b-cells following infection or vaccination, but the longevity and protective efficacy of these memory b-cells against mers-cov infection or re-challenge remain unresolved questions (du et al., 2016b; perlman and vijay, 2016) .t-cell responses elicited by mers-cov vaccines also play important roles in protection against mers. this is supported by the fact that viral clearance was impossible in t-cell deficient mice, but was possible in mice lacking b-cells . although t-cells are demonstrated to be a critical effector in acute viral clearance, protection for subsequent mers-cov infection is largely mediated by humoral immunity . several animal studies also demonstrated activation of t-cell responses following immunization with a mers-cov vaccine candidate, resulting in the elevated secretion of th1 and th2 cytokines (lan et al., 2014; ma et al., 2014a; malczyk et al., 2015; muthumani et al., 2015) . it is also noteworthy to mention that adjuvants could be co-administered with mers-cov vaccines to tailor and possibly enhance the immune responses elicited by the vaccines. one study has indicated that co-administration of the mers-cov vaccine based on the s protein with alum in mice resulted in a th2 biased immunity, whereas a more robust th1 and th2 mixed immune response was produced when an additional adjuvant, cysteinephosphate-guanine (cpg) oligodeoxynucleotides (odn) was included in the formulation (lan et al., 2014) . to date, no detail investigation on mers-cov vaccine-induced memory t-cell responses is reported. however, mers-cov infection was shown to induce memory cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells responses in mers survivors, at least up to 24 months . there is little understanding about the biological function of memory cd4+ t-cells but they are likely to contribute to direct virus inhibition via cytokine production, particularly ifnγ, and enhance the effector functions of cd8+ t-cells and b-cells (macleod et al., 2010) . although subsequent mers-cov infection is generally antibody mediated, memory cd8+ t cells are believed to facilitate virus clearance by eliminating infected cells (kaech and ahmed, 2001; zhao et al., 2017) . mers survivors who later demonstrated strong virus-specific memory cd8+ t-cell responses were also shown to experience mitigated morbidity during the hospitalization period . similarly, the importance of t-cell responses against sars-cov was also highlighted in many studies (channappanavar et al., 2014; chu h. et al., 2014; zhao et al., 2016) . interestingly, unlike sars-cov, mers-cov can infect both the cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in human, resulting in the downregulation of hdpp4, and induced intrinsic and extrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis in t cells, which may lead to severe immunopathology (chu et al., 2016) . in addition, chu et al. (2016) demonstrated the capability of mers-cov in infecting the t cells of common marmosets.it is critical for a potential mers-cov vaccine to induce robust humoral and cell-mediated immunities. although the protection against mers-cov is mainly mediated by humoral immunity, t-cell responses are crucial for acute viral clearance. mucosal route is recommended for mers-cov vaccine delivery to induce the mucosal immunity in addition to the systemic responses. persistence of the virus-specific antibodies induced by mers-cov vaccine is not thoroughly studied but represents a major challenge. an effective mers-cov vaccine is also required to induce immunological memory to provide a long-lived protection which in turn reduces the need of boosters, and in the long run will bring down the cost of vaccinations. lastly, different adjuvants may also be used to improve the immunogenicity of mers-cov vaccines but would require detail studies on the interactions between them to ensure optimal vaccine efficacy and safety. so far, three potential mers-cov vaccines: a dna vaccine and two viral vector-based vaccines have advanced into clinical trials (national institutes of health [nih], 2016 [nih], , 2018b .antibody dependent enhancement (ade) is a condition whereby non-neutralizing antibodies are produced following an infection or a vaccination, which enhance the infectivity of the subsequent infection (kuzmina et al., 2018) . ade of viral infections have been reported for dengue virus, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, other alpha and flaviviruses, sars-cov, and ebola virus (dutry et al., 2011; kuzmina et al., 2018) . thus, ade is a critical issue that should be considered seriously in designing a mers-cov vaccine.attributed to the taxonomic and structural similarities between sars-cov and mers-cov, the processes involved in development of new vaccines against these two viruses, to a large extent, are similar. vaccine candidates against sars-cov were initially developed based on the full-length s protein. however, these vaccines were later demonstrated to induce non-neutralizing antibodies which did not prevent mers-cov infection, and the immunized animals were not protected from the viral challenge instead they experienced adverse effects like enhanced hepatitis, increased morbidity, and stronger inflammatory responses (weingartl et al., 2004; czub et al., 2005) . many potential vaccines against mers-cov were also mainly focused on the same full-length s protein, raising a safety concern on the practical application of these vaccines (du et al., 2016b) .to date, no ade has been observed in mers-cov. indeed, the ade of sars-cov infection in human cells was only discovered 8 years after the virus was first identified in 2003 (yip et al., 2011) . jaume et al. (2012) demonstrated that nonneutralizing antibodies induced by the full-length s protein of sars-cov facilitated the viral entry into host cells via a fcγrdependent pathway. our understanding about mers-cov is relatively lesser compared to sars-cov, mainly due to the fact that the former was discovered less than 7 years, thus it is unsurprising that the ade of mers-cov has yet to be reported (du et al., 2016b) . nevertheless, by employing appropriate strategies and methods, the ade of mers-cov infection could be revealed in the future.two approaches have been suggested to mitigate the adverse effects of ade. the first approach involves shielding the non-neutralizing epitopes of the s proteins by glycosylation, whereas the second approach, namely immunofocusing, aims to direct the adaptive immune responses to target only the critical neutralizing epitope to elicit a more robust protective immunity (du et al., 2016a; okba et al., 2017) . a supporting evidence for the latter is that a mers-cov vaccine candidate based on a shorter s1 domain induced slightly stronger neutralizing activity than that based on the full-length s protein. in addition, a vaccine candidate based on the even shorter rbd induced the highest neutralizing immune responses (okba et al., 2017) .animal models available for evaluation of mers-cov vaccines are highly limited, thus representing a huge challenge for vaccine development. mers-cov infects the human , non-human primates-rhesus macaques munster et al., 2013) and marmosets (falzarano et al., 2014) , and dromedary camels (alagaili et al., 2014; chu d.k. et al., 2014; memish et al., 2014) . the first animal model adopted for the development of mers-cov vaccine was rhesus macaques munster et al., 2013) . they demonstrated clinical symptoms of mers-cov infection including an increase in respiratory rate and body temperature, hunched posture, piloerection, cough, and reduced food intake. radiographic imaging analysis also revealed varying degree of pulmonary diseases following infection. although the viral rna of mers-cov was detected in most of the respiratory tissues, but viral tropism was restricted primarily to the lower respiratory tract. rhesus macaques infected with mers-cov experienced transient, mild to moderate disease severity (van doremalen and munster, 2015; du et al., 2016b) . it is noteworthy that the pathological changes induced in rhesus macaques infected by mers-cov were the results of the host inflammatory responses triggered by the virus instead of the direct viral cytolytic activity (prescott et al., 2018) .the common marmoset is another frequently used animal model to evaluate mers-cov vaccines (falzarano et al., 2014) . similar to rhesus macaques, humoral and cell-mediated immunities could be detected in these animals following mers-cov vaccination. the common marmosets infected with mers-cov developed moderate to severe acute pneumonia and increased viral load in the respiratory tract in addition to other clinical symptoms experienced by rhesus macaques (van doremalen and munster, 2015; yu et al., 2017) . intriguingly, the common marmoset also demonstrated signs of renal damage as in human cases following mers-cov infection, and the viral rna could be detected in other non-respiratory organs contrary to rhesus macaques (van doremalen and munster, 2015; yeung et al., 2016) . falzarano et al. (2014) also reported that the common marmoset could serve as a partially lethal animal model. similarly, chan et al. (2015) demonstrated that marmosets challenged with mers-cov developed severe diseases, leading to fatality. thereafter, marmosets have been successfully used as a moderate and severe model to study mers-cov (baseler et al., 2016; yeung et al., 2016; chen et al., 2017; van doremalen et al., 2017; yu et al., 2017; de wit et al., 2019) .the dromedary camels serve as a natural reservoir for mers-cov, and are responsible for zoonotic transmission of the virus to humans. mild clinical symptoms such as increase in body temperature and rhinorrhea were observed in the dromedary camels infected with mers-cov (adney et al., 2014) . interesting, mers-cov tropism in dromedary camels is limited to the upper respiratory tract, and is less apparent in the lower respiratory tract, contrary to rhesus macaques (adney et al., 2014) . the viral rnas of mers-cov are detectable in the respiratory tract, lymph node and the excreted breath of the infected dromedary camels. viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract of the dromedary camels may explain the efficiency of virus transmission among the camels, and from camels to humans (adney et al., 2014) . the dromedary camels immunized with mersv-cov vaccines were also shown to activate both the b-cell and t-cell responses (muthumani et al., 2015; haagmans et al., 2016; adney et al., 2019) .although camels are the natural reservoirs of mers-cov, whilst macaques and marmosets are closely related to the human, the handling of these large mammals is laborious and costly. the lack of small animal models for the initial screening of potential vaccine candidates greatly hampers the development of mers-cov vaccines. unlike sars-cov, mers-cov does not readily infect smaller rodents such as mice or hamsters due to the substantial differences in the viral binding receptors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) (goldstein and weiss, 2017) . nevertheless, considerable amount of efforts have been devoted to produce mers-cov-permissive small rodents for evaluation of mers-cov vaccines. mice transduced by a viral vector to express human dpp4 (hdpp4) were shown to be susceptible to mers-cov infection, manifested by the development of pneumonia and histopathological changes in the lungs. however, viral clearance in these infected mice was observed at day-8 post-infection, failing to recapitulate severe human diseases . later, a more established transgenic mouse model expressing hdpp4 globally was developed, and it was the first lethal animal model available to evaluate mers-cov vaccines. mortality was noted in these mice within days post-infection, and virus dissemination to other organs was observed with exceptionally high titer detected in the lung and brain (agrawal et al., 2015) . recently, a transgenic mouse model was produced by replacing the full-length mouse dpp4 gene with the human equivalent. however, these transgenic mice did not demonstrate any sign of diseases following the mers-cov infection, and no virus dissemination to other organs was observed (pascal et al., 2015) . crispr/cas9 was also previously employed to sensitize the mice to mers-cov infection by substituting two amino acids at positions 288 and 230 of the mouse dpp4. although these genetically engineered mice allowed viral replication in the lungs, they did not experience apparent morbidity following infection by the wild-type mers-cov. severe diseases were observed only when the mice were infected by mouse-adapted mers-cov generated via 15 serial lung passages (cockrell et al., 2016) . as mouse dpp4 is vital to normal glucose homeostasis and immunity, altering the mouse dpp4 could have unforeseen complications to the mouse model (fan et al., 2018) . therefore, another transgenic mouse model has been introduced, in which the hdpp4 gene was inserted into the genome of c57bl/6mouse at rosa26 locus using the crispr/cas9 technology. this mouse model, namely r26-hdpp4, when infected by mers-cov at low dose, developed severe lung diseases related to acute respiratory symptoms (ards) and central nervous system (cns). in addition, the r26-hdpp4 is also susceptible to infection by a mers-cov pseudovirus, serving as an alternative to test mers-cov vaccines in the absence of bsl-3 facility (fan et al., 2018) . all of the animal models described above are summarized in table 1 .apart from the mouse model, rabbits were also reported to be asymptomatically infected by mers-cov. by extensive research, these animals could represent another potential animal model to evaluate mers-cov vaccines (haagmans et al., 2015) . smaller animal models are more economically available to vaccine evaluations in addition to the ease of animal manipulation and readily available methods in testing vaccine efficacy.as of now, sars-cov and mers-cov are the only coronaviruses known to cause severe diseases in human. development of sars vaccines was mainly focused on the s protein of sars-cov (bukreyev et al., 2004; weingartl et al., 2004; yang et al., 2004; czub et al., 2005; kam et al., 2007; lin et al., 2007; fett et al., 2013) . to date, no vaccine has been licensed to prevent mers-cov infection. although several vaccine candidates are currently in clinical trials, many still remained in the pre-clinical stage. current approaches for the the animals manifested clinical signs within 24 h following infection, including increase in respiratory rate and body temperature, hunched posture, piloerection, cough, reduced food intake and varying degree of pneumonia. no mortality was observed in the infected animals throughout the study. the increase in white blood cell counts was early and transient, and viral-load was reported to be higher in lower respiratory tract and decreased overtime.rhesus macaques the animals experienced early increase in neutrophil at day-1 post-infection (p.i.), and restored at day-3 p.i. development of pneumonia in the animals was rapid after the infection but short-lived. no mortality or virus dissemination to other non-respiratory tissue was observed in the infected animals. infection is restricted primarily at lower respiratory tract.-genetically closer to human -do not recapitulate severe diseases in human -expensive model due to high husbandry requirement de wit et al., 2013the rectal temperature of the animals increased at 1 to 2 days p.i. and restored thereafter. extensive lung lesions and varying degree of inflammation were observed in the lungs of the animals collected at day-3 p.i. other pathological changes of the infected lungs include interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, hemorrhaging, degeneration and necrosis of pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells. no sign of damage in other non-respiratory organs was observed.immunosuppressed rhesus macaquesthe immunosuppressed animals developed rapid pneumonia but less severe than the non-immunosuppressed monkey. higher viral load, viral shedding, and virus dissemination to other non-respiratory organs were observed in the immunosuppressed animals following infection.-potential model for mimicking mers-cov infection in immunocompromised patients -expensive model due to high husbandry requirement -additional treatment is required to produce immunosuppressed animals prescott et al., 2018 common marmosetsmost of the infected animals developed progressive severe pneumonia characterized by interstitial infiltration. some animals were euthanized because of diseases severity. extensive lung lesions were observed in all the infected animals at different necropsies time points. viral rna could be detected in blood, respiratory organs and other non-respiratory organs including kidney, suggesting virus dissemination.-severe, partially lethal animal model -able to manifest renal damage -expensive model due to high husbandry requirement falzarano et al., 2014 common marmosetsinfected animals developed severe pneumonia at day-3 p.i. characterized by exudative pathological changes with widespread pulmonary edema, hemorrhaging, and huge number of inflammatory cells. yu et al., 2017 common marmosetsin vitro analysis using lung and kidney cells showed that hyperexpression of smad7 or fgf2 induced by mers-cov led to an immense apoptotic response. in general, iwv vaccine is the most rapid approach for vaccine production following a new outbreak. however, the use of iwv as a vaccine in mers was reported to be associated with hypersensitivity-type lung immunopathologic reaction in the mouse model (agrawal et al., 2015) , thereby limiting its potential. subunit vaccine is by far the most popular method in the development of mers vaccine, mostly focusing on the recombinant rbd of the s protein produced in heterologous expression systems. subunit vaccines, however, are often administered along with adjuvants to boost the immunogenicity of the recombinant antigens. nanoparticles such as vlps-based vaccines are similar to subunit vaccines, in which only specific viral proteins are expressed. unlike subunit vaccines, vlps-based vaccines are comprised of recombinant viral proteins capable of self-assembling into larger particles resembling viruses. although the immunogenicity of vlps-based vaccines could be enhanced by adjuvants, the vlps themselves can serve as adjuvants which increase the immunogenicity of displayed epitopes, particularly those of smaller ones (murata et al., 2003; quan et al., 2008) . live attenuated vaccines are composed of live viruses, which have been modified to remove or reduce their virulence. this type of vaccine is often very immunogenic, whereby a single administration without an adjuvant is sufficient to induce protective immunity. however, the risk of reversion to a virulent virus has limited its usage as mers vaccine. viral vector-based vaccine is one of the most popular approaches in developing mers vaccines. two out of the three candidate vaccines which have entered the clinical phase are viral vector vaccines. this approach utilizes well-studied virus replication system to display mers-cov antigen, thereby inducing protective immunity against mers-cov. another candidate vaccine currently in phase i/ii clinical trial is a dna vaccine. unlike other types of vaccines, dna vaccine production does not involve virus replication, protein expression and purification, therefore reduce the cost of production. however, administration of dna vaccines often requires an external device such as electroporator or gene gun, which eventually increases the cost of immunization. table 2 summarizes the vaccine candidates against mers-cov infection, which are further discussed intensively in the following sections. viral-vector rad5 encoding s1 protein im immunization with rad5 constructs expressing cd40-targeted s1 fusion protein (rad5-s1/f/cd40l) offered complete protection to hdpp4 transgenic mice against mers-cov challenge and prevented pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage. dna encoding s or s1 protein im dna encoding s1 protein elicited stronger antibody and cellular immune responses in mice than that encoding the s protein. both dnas encoding s1 and s proteins induced neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with mers-cov strains of human and camel origins.dna encoding s1 protein im immunization with dna encoding s1 protein and passive transfer of immune sera from the vaccinated mice protected hdpp4-transduced-mice from mers-cov infection.frontiers in microbiology | www.frontiersin.org recombinant rbd im or sc when the subunit vaccine was administered together with combination of alum and cpg odn, optimized rbd-specific humoral and cellular immunity were elicted. robust rbd-specific antibody and t-cell responses were induced in mice immunized with the vaccine in combination with ifa and cpg odn, but low level of neutralizing antibodies were induced. frontiers in microbiology | www.frontiersin.org the first viral vector-based vaccine was reported by moss et al. (1984) who developed a potential hepatitis b vaccine using the vaccinia viral vector. unlike subunit or inactivated vaccines, which generally function as extracellular antigens, a viral vector works by carrying a dna encoding immunogenic components into host cells, followed by intracellular antigen expression, thereby activating a broad spectrum cell-mediated immunity in addition to the humoral immune responses. majority of the viral-vector based vaccines do not require adjuvant for optimum efficacy (ura et al., 2014) . adenovirus and modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) are the two most common viral vectors used in the development of mers-cov vaccines. mice immunized intramuscularly with the recombinant human adenoviral (type 5 or 41) vector encoding the full-length s protein were shown to induce systemic neutralizing antibodies and mucosal t-cells immunity. intriguingly, no mucosal t-cell response was detected when the vaccine was administered via an intragastric route, contrary to previous findings which suggested the importance of mucosal vaccination in activating the mucosal immunity . a recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (rad5) vector encoding the shorter s1 extracellular domain of the s protein was reported to elicit slightly stronger neutralizing antibody responses than that encoding the fulllength, suggesting the effect of immunofocusing (kim et al., 2014) . a recent study by hashem et al. (2019) demonstrated that rad5 constructs expressing cd40-targeted s1 fusion protein (rad5-s1/f/cd40l) offered a complete protection to hdpp4 transgenic mice against mers-cov challenge, and prevented pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage. additionally, jung et al. (2018) showed that heterologous prime-boost vaccination with rad5-s protein and alum-adjuvanted recombinant s protein nanoparticle successfully induced both the th1 and th2 immune responses in specific-pathogen-free balb/c mice.pre-existing immunity against human adenovirus in human population is widespread, hampering its clinical application as a vector for vaccine development (fausther-bovendo and kobinger, 2014) . recent developments of new adenovirus vectors for vaccine antigen delivery focus on the serotype to which human population is less exposed. chimpanzee adenovirus (chadox1) represents an attractive alternative to the human adenoviral vector due to its good safety profile and lack of preexisting immunity in human population (dicks et al., 2012) , and has since been employed in the vaccine development against mers-cov infection. the recombinant chadox1 encoding full-length s protein (chadox1 mers) was shown to be immunogenic in mice, and lethal virus challenge using hdpp4 transgenic mouse model further demonstrated its high protective efficacy against mers-cov (alharbi et al., 2017; munster et al., 2017) . it is noteworthy that the immunogenicity of s protein could be improved by insertion of a gene encoding the signal peptide of human tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) upstream of the s gene of mers-cov, in both chadox1 and mva vectors (alharbi et al., 2017) . currently, a candidate mers-cov vaccine known as mers001, which contains the chadox1 encoding the s protein of mers-cov is at phase i clinical trial. the trial is estimated to be completed by december 2019, in which the safety and immunogenicity of mers001 at different dosage are being studied in healthy adult volunteers recruited and sponsored by the university of oxford, united kingdom (national institutes of health [nih], 2018b).recombinant mva encoding the full-length s protein represents another potential mers-cov vaccine candidate due to its good safety profile, decent immunogenicity, and high protective efficacy against mers-cov (song et al., 2013; volz et al., 2015; alharbi et al., 2017) . another candidate vaccine currently in phase i clinical trial is mva-mers-s. the trial is being performed by the university medical center hamburg-eppendorf, germany, in which the safety and immunogenicity of mva-mers-s in healthy adult volunteers are being assessed (national institutes of health [nih], 2018c). apart from the s protein, the highly conserved n protein of mers-cov was inserted into mva, and inoculated into mice. although the recombinant mva encoding the n-protein elicited cd8+ t-cell response in the immunized mice, its protective efficacy was not investigated (veit et al., 2018) .apart from adenovirus and mva, newcastle disease virus (ndv) was also used as a viral-vector for displaying mers-cov s protein. the ndv-based vaccine candidate induced neutralizing antibodies in balb/c mice and bactrian camels . although viral vector-based vaccines are able to induce robust immune responses, they are not free from drawbacks, which include pre-existing immunity against viral vector, risk of pathogenesis, low viral titer production, and potential tumorigenesis (ura et al., 2014) .dna vaccine is composed of a recombinant plasmid encoding immunogens. this vaccine is typically delivered via direct injection, gene gun, or electroporation into host cells, where the immunogens can be expressed and prime the immune system (ferraro et al., 2011) . dna vaccine offers two distinct advantages over the subunit or protein-based vaccine: the ease of dna manipulation and low cost of production (leitner et al., 1999) .similarly, all dna vaccines developed against mers-cov target the s protein or the shorter s1 domain of mers-cov. dna encoding the full-length s protein was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and robust cellmediated immunity in mice, macaques, and camels. when the immunized macaques were challenged with mers-cov, characteristic clinical symptoms including pneumonia were mitigated (muthumani et al., 2015) . gls-5300 is one of the three candidate vaccines currently in a clinical trial. sponsored by the geneone life science, inc., korea, a phase i clinical trial to test the vaccine's safety profile in human volunteers was completed in the walter reed army institute of research, united states (national institutes of health [nih], 2016). currently, the phase i and phase ii clinical trials are being performed in the international vaccine institute, korea, to further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of gls-5300, as well as a device for electroporation (cellectra r 2000 electroporation) (national institutes of health [nih], 2018a).to avoid the possible adverse effects induced by the full-length s protein, other researchers revealed that immunization with a dna encoding the s1 domain, and passive transfer of immune sera from the vaccinated mice protected hdpp4-transducedmice from mers-cov infection (chi et al., 2017) . the dna encoding the s1 domain was also demonstrated to be more superior than that encoding the full-length s protein in eliciting antibody and cellular responses. both dnas encoding the s1 and s proteins were shown to induce neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with mers-cov strains of human and camel origins (al-amri et al., 2017) . despite the effectiveness of dna vaccines, spontaneous plasmid integration into host genomes represents a potential risk, but the probability is extremely low (ledwith et al., 2000) .in general, subunit vaccines have the highest safety profile among all current vaccines despite their low immunogenicities (du et al., 2016b) . precautions should be taken during the development of mers-cov vaccines based on the s protein to avoid induction of non-neutralizing antibodies. unlike the full-length s protein, rbd of mers-cov comprises the critical neutralizing domains but lacking the non-neutralizing immunodominant region. therefore, upon immunization, the rbd-based vaccines are restricted to produce rbd-specific neutralizing immune responses, thus are incapable of inducing non-neutralizing antibodies that may potentially contribute to harmful pathological effects (du and jiang, 2015; wang et al., 2015a) . from the safety and effectiveness perspectives, the rbd is a more promising candidate in the development of mers-cov vaccines over the full-length s protein.the rbd of mers-cov was reported to induce neutralizing antibodies against multiple strains of mers-cov due to the presence of several conformational neutralizing epitopes (du et al., 2016b) . any mers-cov strains with a single mutation in an epitope may not suffice to escape the rbd-specific neutralizing antibodies. wang et al. (2015a) demonstrated that an amino acid mutation at position 509 (aspartic acid to glycine substitution) in rbd rendered the mutated strain resisted to neutralization by a rbd-specific monoclonal antibody, f11, but susceptible to another rbd-specific monoclonal antibody, d12. both of these antibodies could bind to different regions of the rbd of mers-cov. similarly, the rbd of sars-cov also consists of multiple neutralizing domains that are capable of inducing broad neutralizing immune responses against many sars-cov strains (he et al., 2006) . development of antibody escape mutants may require a mutation in two or more epitopes in the rbd of mers-cov, which is less likely to take place, and if developed, may exhibit reduced viral fitness (tang et al., 2014; tai et al., 2017) .it was demonstrated that the mers-cov s1 protein with mf59 adjuvant protected hdpp4 transgenic mice against lethal mers-cov challenge, where the protection correlated well with the neutralizing antibody titer (wang et al., 2017c) . in addition, adjuvanted recombinant s1 proteins (advax hcxl adjuvant and sigman adjuvant system) reduced and delayed virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels (mers-cov animal reservoir), and provided complete protection in alpaca (a surrogate infection model) against mers-cov challenge (adney et al., 2019) .in general, mers-cov subunit vaccines based on the s1 domain require the use of adjuvant or fusion with an immune enhancer to heighten immunogenicity. several studies have indicated that rbd fused with fc fragment of human igg (rbd-fc) elicited strong systemic neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice (du et al., 2013; ma et al., 2014a; tang et al., 2015; nyon et al., 2018) and new zealand white rabbits (ma et al., 2014b) . hdpp4-transduced-mice immunized with rbd-fc were also protected from viral challenge (ma et al., 2014a) . other adjuvants such as freund's adjuvant, alum, monophosphoryl lipid a, montanide isa51 and mf59 were also reported to further improve the immunogenicity and protection of rbd-fc in mice, particularly mf59 is superior among these adjuvants (zhang et al., 2016) . in addition, coadministration of multiple adjuvants together with rbd antigen could synergistically improve the immunogenicity of the rbdbased subunit vaccine. mice immunized with rbd antigen together with alum and cpg odn produced stronger humoral and cellular immune responses than those immunized with rbd antigen and alum or cpg odn alone (lan et al., 2014) . rbdbased subunit vaccine was also previously tested in the rhesus macaque model in the presence of alum. this vaccine formulation was shown to induce robust and sustained humoral and cellular immunities, and partially protected rhesus macaques from viral challenge .as native spikes of mers-cov exist in the form of trimers, vaccine designs mimicking the native viral s proteins have also been reported (tai et al., 2016; pallesen et al., 2017) . through the use of foldon (fd), a t4 fibritin trimerization domain, pallesen et al. (2017) synthesized a recombinant prefusion trimeric mers-cov s protein, which induced high titer of neutralizing antibodies in balb/cj mice. similarly, tai et al. (2016) expressed rbd trimers on fd, and demonstrated the vaccine's protective efficacy (83% survival) in hdpp4 transgenic mice against lethal mers-cov challenge.although most of the subunit vaccine studies focused on the rbd of the s protein, a recent study by jiaming et al. (2017) proposed the use of recombinant n-terminal domain (rntd) of the s protein as another potential vaccine candidate. the rntd, when used to immunize balb/c mice, induced neutralizing antibodies and reduced the respiratory tract pathology of mice in a non-lethal mers-cov challenge.apart from focusing on the s protein, multivalent vaccines designed using in silico methods which contain the b cell and t cell epitopes of s, e, m, n and nsps have been proposed (srivastava et al., 2018) . however, until now, no biological data have been presented for these multivalent vaccines. in addition, the n protein and s2 domain of s protein are more conserved among coronaviruses, representing other attractive targets in the development of a broad-spectrum coronavirus vaccine (schindewolf and menachery, 2019) . nevertheless, it is crucial to ensure that these proteins do not contribute to the ade of mers-cov infection.virus-like particles are nanoscale particles similar to the native viral particles but devoid of infectious genetic materials. they are composed of repetitive viral structural proteins with inherent self-assembly properties. vlps are non-replicative and noninfectious. vlps can be produced by expressing the viral structural proteins in a suitable expression system (yong et al., 2015a,b; ong et al., 2017) . in general, vlps-based vaccine is similar to the whole inactivated virus vaccine, but it does not require the viral inactivation step which may alter the antigenicity and immunogenicity of a viral protein. because no live virus is involved in the manufacturing process, vlps can be easily generated in a low-containment manufacturing environment (dezure et al., 2016) .virus-like particles of mers-cov were previously produced in baculoviral expression system by co-expressing the s, e and m proteins of mers-cov. the vlps generated were indistinguishable from the authentic viral particle when observed under an electron microscope. these vlps, when administered with alum induced neutralizing antibodies and a th1-biased immunity in rhesus macaques (wang et al., 2017b) . intriguingly, when the s protein of mers-cov was expressed alone, it selfassembles into nanoparticles of approximately 25 nm, about a quarter of the diameter of the authentic viral particle. immunogenicity studies in mice demonstrated that these nanoparticles elicited antibody responses in the presence of alum, and when the adjuvant was replaced with matrix m1 adjuvant, they induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibodies (coleman et al., 2014) . viral challenge in hdpp4transduced-mice which had been immunized with matrix m1 and s protein nanoparticles further proven the protective efficacy of this vaccine formulation against mers-cov . as mentioned earlier under the viral vector-based vaccine, adjuvanted s protein nanoparticles as boosters in mice primed with rad-5 s have also yielded promising th1 and th2 immune responses (jung et al., 2018) .advancement in genetic engineering enables vlps to display different epitopes of viruses, producing chimeric vlps (cvlps) (ong et al., 2017) . expression of the rbd of mers-cov fused to the vp2 structural protein of canine parvovirus (cpv) produced cvlps displaying the rbd of mers-cov. these cvlps were morphologically similar to native cpv and elicited both rbdspecific humoral and cell-mediated immunities in mice (wang et al., 2017a) . the cvlps displaying the s protein of mers-cov and matrix 1 protein of influenza a virus were also developed, and shown to be immunogenic in mouse models. however, the actual protective efficacy of these cvlps against mers-cov has yet to be investigated in vivo .in addition to vaccines based on vlps, non-viral nanoparticle such as ferritin has also been reported as a potential carrier for mers-cov antigen . kim et al. (2018) utilized a chaperna-mediated ferritin nanoparticle to display mers-cov rbd. when adjuvanted with mf59, the ferritinbased nanoparticle induced rbd-specific antibodies in balb/c mice, which inhibited rbd binding to hdpp4 receptor protein, suggesting its potential use as mers-cov antigen carrier .inactivated whole-virus comprises the entire disease causing virion which is inactivated physically (heat) or chemically. iwv offers several advantages, including relatively low cost of production, good safety profile, and does not involve laborious genetic manipulation (dezure et al., 2016) . nevertheless, production of iwv requires the live virus to be grown under a high-level containment, and the antigenicity of the immunogen could be altered in the viral inactivation step (dezure et al., 2016) .formaldehyde-inactivated-mers-cov induced neutralizing antibodies in mice, but not t-cell response. supplementing this iwv with a combined adjuvant (alum and cpg odn) was reported to enhance its protective immunity against mers-cov in mice transduced with hdpp4 . on the other hand, an inactivated bivalent whole virus vaccine that targets rabies virus (rabv) and mers-cov was recently developed using a recombinant vector encoding a fusion protein comprising the mers-cov s1 domain fused to the c-terminus of rabv g protein. following expression, the s1 domain was incorporated into rabv particles (bnsp333-s1). when the mice were immunized with the chemically inactivated bnsp333-s1, robust neutralizing antibody responses against s1 and g proteins were detected. inactivated bnsp333-s1 also protected hdpp4transduced-mice against mers-cov challenge (wirblich et al., 2017) . despite the benefits associated with iwv-based vaccines, inactivated mers-cov vaccine was reported to potentially cause a hypersensitivity-type lung immunopathologic reaction upon mers-cov challenge, even though it induced neutralizing antibodies and reduced the viral load in hdpp4 transgenic mice, similar to those observed in sars-cov (agrawal et al., 2016) .live attenuated vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines due to its capability to induce immunity similar to the natural infection. this vaccine contains viable but attenuated virus. common approaches to develop a live attenuated vaccine include deletion of the viral genes that confer virulence, and via reverse genetic. in general, live attenuated vaccines are highly immunogenic, thus do not require adjuvant for optimal efficacy, and single immunization is usually sufficient to induce protective immunity. nevertheless, live attenuated vaccines come with some unwanted limitations, particularly the risk of reversion to a virulent strain, and the absolute need for vaccine cold chain. live attenuated vaccine is also not suitable for infants, immunocompromised individuals, and elderly people (lauring et al., 2010) .a live attenuated vaccine against mers-cov was previously developed by deleting the e gene of mers-cov (rmers-cov-e). this engineered virus lacked infectivity and replicated in a single cycle. vaccines based on the live attenuated viruses could pose biosafety problems associated with the risk of virulence reversion, whereas rmers-cov-e is propagation defective in the absence of e protein, preventing a straightforward reversion to virulence, thus providing a safer alternative (almazan et al., 2013) . more recently, a live attenuated mers-cov was generated through mutation of nsp16 (d130a), where the attenuated virus protected crispr-cas9-targeted 288-330 +/+ c57bl/6 mice from a mouse-adapted mers-cov challenge (menachery et al., 2017) .other than mers-cov, a replication competent recombinant measles virus (mv) was used as a platform for the development of live attenuated mers-cov vaccine. the recombinant mv was engineered to express the full-length s protein (mv vac2 -cov-s) or its truncated version (mv vac2 -cov-sols). both mv vac2 -cov-s and mv vac2 -cov-sols were shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses against mv and mers-cov, and protected hdpp4transduced-mice from mers-cov challenge (malczyk et al., 2015) . three years later, bodmer et al. (2018) compared the mv vac2 -cov-s with its uv-inactivated derivative, and showed that the inactivated version did not induce any specific immune response against both the mv and mers-cov. concurrently, bodmer et al. (2018) constructed a live attenuated recombinant mv expressing mers-cov n protein (mv vac2 -mers-n), and its administration into ifnar −/− -cd46ge mice (genetically modified mice deficient of type i ifn receptor and transgenically expressing human cd46) induced n-specific t cell responses, although not as strong as those of mv vac2 -cov-s. similarly, in another study, a viable recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) with its g protein replaced with the s protein of mers-cov also elicited both humoral and cell-mediated immunities in rhesus macaques .development of mers vaccines started immediately following the discovery of mers-cov in 2012. pre-clinical trials on animal models capable of recapitulating the clinical signs and symptoms in the human are a must prior to clinical trials and licensing of a vaccine (gerdts et al., 2007) . the choice of an animal model is generally preferable to be as phylogenetically closer as possible to the human (swearengen, 2018) . therefore, majority of the vaccine candidates will be evaluated in non-human primates such as chimpanzees, rhesus macaques (sibal and samson, 2001) or marmosets (carrion and patterson, 2012) . employing these animal models in experiments, however, is extremely costly (gerdts et al., 2015) . before involving non-human primates in a vaccine evaluation, strong justification or supporting evidence from in vitro analysis, or more preferable from animal studies such as small rodents are often required (gerdts et al., 2015) . however, mers-cov cannot infect smaller rodents naturally, representing a huge challenge in initial vaccine developments (goldstein and weiss, 2017) . although transgenic mouse models for evaluation of mers-cov vaccines have been successfully developed, the costs of these transgenic animals are not affordable by many research groups, especially those from the less affluent parts of the world. this issue consequently delayed the development of an effective vaccine, and its advancement into clinical trial.funding is the primary drivers in any vaccine developments. many vaccines demonstrating promising results at the pre-clinical stage require additional investments from the government or the private industry to advance into clinical trials (hakoum et al., 2017) . however, government funding for clinical trials is rather restricted, whereas private industry is generally profit oriented, of which the market size and potential profits are of priority (smith, 2000) . unlike other widespread diseases such as hepatitis and influenza, mers cases are primarily reported in saudi arabia apart from the korea outbreak (gossner et al., 2016) . its relatively low occurrence is likely to limit the market size of mers vaccines, leading to lower interest by the private funding bodies. although three potential mers vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical trials, they are currently in phase i/ii. as completing the entire trials often take 10 years and above, they are unlikely to be commercially available in the coming 3-5 years.despite having a low occurrence of recorded human-to-human transmission, the recent mers outbreak in south korea which demonstrated virus emergence in second and third generation contacts has reignited public awareness regarding the danger of mers-cov. as no effective treatment against mers is currently available, therefore the best solution is to develop a functional mers vaccine to prevent mers-cov infection. amongst the six types of vaccines discussed above, more studies are focused on the viral vector-based and subunit vaccines. even though many promising vaccine candidates have been proposed and reported, as of now, only three potential mers-cov vaccine candidates have progressed to phase i clinical trials: a dna vaccine (gls-5300) and two viral vector-based vaccines (mva-mers-s and mers001. it is still very likely that no mers vaccine will be available in the market for human in the near future. therefore, considerable efforts should be given to minimize delays in executing clinical trials, such as better understanding and coordination between sponsors, primary investigators, investigators, participants and stakeholders.cy and ho wrote the manuscript. sy, kh, and wt reviewed, edited, and approved its final version. coronaviruses (covs) are positive-sense, single-stranded rna viruses of the family coronaviridae (subfamily coronavirinae) that infect a wide host range to produce diseases ranging from common cold to severe/fatal illnesses. the novel virus was initially named "2019-ncov" which was changed to "sars-cov-2" by the coronavirus study group (csg) of international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ictv), since it was found to be the sister virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov). 1 the ongoing coronavirus threat that emerged in china has rapidly spread to other countries and has been declared as a global health emergency by the world health organization (who). many nations are diverting their best efforts for the implementation of appropriate preventive and control strategies. neither vaccines nor direct-acting antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of human and animal coronavirus infections. [2] [3] [4] many efforts have been directed to develop vaccines against human cov infections in recent decades, but a limiting factor is the degree of cross-protection rendered by these vaccines due to their extensive sequence diversity. 5 various vaccines, immunotherapeutics, and drug options have been explored during the recent threats of zika, ebola, and nipah viruses [6] [7] [8] as well as against previous covs including sars-and mers-covs. 3, 5, [9] [10] [11] [12] these valuable options can be exploited for their potency, efficacy, and safety along with expediting other ongoing research 2, 4, [13] [14] [15] so as to discover valuable modalities for tackling the emerging covid-19, but as yet there is no effective vaccine or therapeutic, for which intense efforts are ongoing.most of the therapeutic options that are available for managing covid-19 are based on previous experiences in treating sars-and mers-cov. a major reason for the lack of approved and commercially available vaccines or therapeutic agents against these covs might be the relative lack of interest among the pharmaceutical companies. 13 these are outbreak scenarios: the demand for drugs or vaccines lasts only for a period while the outbreak lasts. the number of affected people will also be a small proportion of the global drug and vaccine market. so by the time a new drug or vaccine is developed, there might not be any patients for clinical trials and also no meaningful market for newly discovered drugs. according to who guidelines, infected patients will receive supportive care including oxygen therapy, fluid therapy, and antibiotics for treating secondary bacterial infections. the who also recommends the isolation of patients suspected or confirmed for covid-19. 16 the major therapeutic drugs that might be effective in managing covid-19 include remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with interferon-β, convalescent plasma, and mabs. 17 nevertheless, before utilizing these drugs for covid-19 pneumonia patients, clinical efficacy, and safety studies should be conducted. this article describes advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter covid-19 while also discussing experiences with sars-and mers-covs, which together could pave ways in the right direction to halt this emerging virus.multiple strategies are adopted in the development of cov vaccines; most of these target the surface-exposed spike (s) glycoprotein or s protein as the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. several s-protein-based strategies have been attempted for developing cov vaccines, e.g., use of full-length s protein or s1-receptor-binding domain (rbd) and expression in virus-like particles (vlp), dna, or viral vectors 5, 9, [18] [19] [20] [21] the s protein molecule contains two subunits, s1 and s2. the s1 subunit has an rbd that interacts with its host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), whereas the s2 subunit mediates fusion between the virus and host cell membranes for releasing viral rna into the cytoplasm for replication. 19 hence, s-proteinbased vaccines should induce antibodies that block not only viral receptor binding but also virus genome uncoating. it has been shown that the c-terminal domain of the s1 subunit of porcine deltacoronavirus constitutes the immunodominant region, and the immune response to this region shows the most potent neutralizing effect. 22 the s protein has a major role in the induction of protective immunity during infection with sars-cov by eliciting neutralizing-antibodies and t-cell responses. 19 thus, full-length or appropriate parts of the s glycoprotein are believed to be the most promising candidate cov vaccine composition. it was also reported that neither the absence nor presence of the other structural proteins affects s protein immunogenicity or its binding to the ace2 receptor that is a critical initial step for virus to access into the host cell. 23, 24 due to the superior ability of rbd to induce neutralizing antibody, both recombinant proteins that contain rbd and the recombinant vectors that encode rbd can be used for developing the effective sars-cov vaccines. 18 recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine expressing mers-cov s protein induces systemic igg, secretory iga, and lungresident memory t-cell responses when administered intranasally into balb/c mice and provide long-lasting neutralizing immunity to mers spike pseudotyped virus, thereby suggesting that the vaccine may confer protection against mers-cov. 24 furthermore, rabies virus (rv) as a viral vector as well as grampositive enhancer matrix (gem) as a bacterial vector has been used to express mers-cov s protein. the immune responses to these vaccine candidates were evaluated in balb/c mice for cellular and humoral immune responses, which showed that rvbased vaccine stimulates significantly higher levels of cellular immunity and earlier antibody responses in comparison to the gem particle vector. 12 the possibility of developing a universal cov vaccine was assessed based on the similarity in t-cell epitopes of sarsand mers-cov that confirmed the potential for crossreactivity among covs. 25 sars-cov-2 shares high genetic similarity with the sars-cov 26 such that vaccines developed for sars-cov may exhibit cross-reactivity to sars-cov-2. the comparative evaluation performed on full-length s protein sequences of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov identified that the most variable residues were located in the s1 subunit of s protein, the critical cov vaccine target. 27 these findings suggest that the specific neutralizing antibodies that are effective against the sars-cov might not be effective against the sars-cov-2. even though the s protein of sars-cov-2 has key mutations compared to the sars-cov, they will still act as a viable target for vaccine development. 28 likewise, the close similarity of sars-cov-2 to the sars-cov suggests that the receptor of sars-cov-2 might be the same as that of sars-cov receptor (ace2). 29 immuno-informatics approach can be used for the identification of epitopes for inclusion in covid-19 vaccine candidates. recently, immuno-informatics was used to identify significant cytotoxic t lymphocyte (ctl) and b-cell epitopes in sars-cov-2 s protein. the interactions between these epitopes and their corresponding mhc class i molecules were studied further by using molecular dynamics simulations and found that the ctl epitopes bind with mhc class i peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, thus indicating their potential for generating immune responses. 30 such epitopes may possess the ideal characteristics to become part of covid-19 vaccine candidates. the nucleocapsid (n) protein as well as the potential b cell epitopes of the e protein of mers-cov has been suggested as probable immunoprotective targets that induce both t-cell and neutralizing antibody responses. 31, 32 reverse genetic strategies have been successfully used in live-attenuated vaccines to inactivate the exonuclease effects of non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) or to delete the envelope protein in sars. 5 avian infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) is a chicken cov. it was suggested that avian live virus ibv vaccine (strain h) might be useful for sars 33 given that protection provided by strain h is based on neutralizing antibody production as well as other immune responses. hence, avian ibv vaccine may be considered another option for covid-19 after evaluating its safety in monkeys. 34 scientists of rocky mountain laboratories are collaborating with oxford university to develop a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored covid-19 vaccine candidate. 35 the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) recently announced the initiation of three programs aimed to develop covid-19 vaccines by utilizing established vaccine platforms. 36 among the three programs, two are continuations of previously initiated partnerships. cepi collaborated with inovio in 2018 to developing dna vaccine candidates for mers ($56 m funding). the vaccine in development utilizes dna medicines' platform for delivering synthetic genes into cells for translation into antigenic proteins, which elicit t-cell and antibody responses. cepi has collaborated with the university of queensland in 2019 to develop the molecular clamp vaccine platform against multiple viral pathogens including mers-cov ($10 m funding). the vaccine platform functions by synthesizing viral surface proteins that get attached to the host cells and clamp them into shape. this facilitates easier recognition of antigens by the immune system. 36 other than these ongoing programs, cepi has announced funding to moderna for comparing mrna therapeutics and vaccines. they will design and manufacture an mrna vaccine in collaboration with the vaccine research center (vrc) of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), a part of the national institutes of health (nih). 37 niaid-vrc scientists are developing a vaccine candidate expressing sars-cov-2 s protein in the mrna vaccine platform technology. this vaccine is expected to undergo clinical testing in the coming months. 35 direct administration of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) may play an effective role in cov control as an intervention in exposed individuals. it has been observed that patients recovering from sars display potent neutralizing antibody responses. 9 a clinical trial proposed the use of a set of mabs that functionally target specific domains in mers-cov s protein. these mabs bind to six specific epitope groups interacting with the receptor binding, membrane fusion, and sialic acid-binding sites, which represent the three important entry functions of mers-cov s protein. 21, 38 moreover, passive immunization with poorly and potently neutralizing antibodies induces substantial protection in mice subjected to lethal mers-cov challenge. thus, use of these antibodies may represent a novel approach to increase humoral protection against emerging covs by targeting various s protein epitopes and functions. the cross-neutralization capacity of sars-cov rbd-specific neutralizing mabs greatly depends on the similarity between their rbds. this is why sars-cov rbdspecific antibodies can cross-neutralize sars-like (sl) covs, i.e., bat-sl-cov strain wiv1 rbd that had 8 amino acid differences to sars-cov, but not bat-sl-cov strain shc014 (24 amino acid differences). 39 such cross-neutralizing sars-cov rbd-specific mabs can be evaluated for efficacy with sars-cov-2. this requires a comparative analysis of sars-cov-2 rbd with sars-cov so that suitable rbd-specific mabs can be identified and evaluated in clinical trials. regeneron is trying to identify mabs specific and effective for covid-19. combination therapy with mabs and the drug remdesivir could be an ideal therapeutic option for covid-19. 40 further evaluation is required before confirming the efficacy of such combination therapy.technology is available for making fully human antibodies (such as human single-chain antibodies; hu-scfvs) or humanized-nanobodies (single-domain antibodies, sdab, vh/vhh) that can traverse across the membrane of the virus-infected cells (trans bodies) and bind to or interfere with biological activities of replicating virus proteins which consequently leads to inhibition of virus replication. examples include trans bodies to influenza virus, hepatitis c virus, ebola virus, and dengue virus. 41 thus, it is possible to generate trans bodies to cov intracellular proteins such as the papain-like proteases (plpro), cysteine-like protease (3clpro) or other non-structural proteins (nsps) that are pivotal for cov replication and transcription for safe, nonimmunogenic, broadly effective passive immunization of covexposed subjects and treatment of infected patients.suitable animal models for evaluating vaccines for sars-and mers-cov are lacking or highly limited, making the process of vaccine development highly challenging. 42, 43 development of an efficient animal model that mimics the clinical disease can inform on pathogenesis as well as to develop vaccines and therapeutics against these covs. several animal models have been evaluated for sars-and mers covs including mouse, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, rhesus macaques, marmosets, and cats. 42, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] early effort was directed in developing animal models for sars-cov, but the specificity of the virus to ace2 (receptor of sars-cov) was a major hindrance to such efforts. later, a sars-cov transgenic mouse model was developed by introducing hace2 gene into the mouse genome. 51 the first animal model used for developing a mers-cov vaccine was rhesus macaques. infected animals showed clinical symptoms such as increased body temperature, piloerection, cough, hunched posture, and reduced food intake. 52 another frequently used animal model for mers-cov is the common marmoset, wherein the virus caused lethal pneumonia. 53 humoral and cell-mediated immunity could be detected in both rhesus macaques and common marmoset following mers-cov immunization. 43 47 these hamsters are a potential model for studying cov pathology and pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. the attenuated nsp16 cov vaccine was studied in mice. 54 attempts to develop animal models for mers-cov such as mice, hamsters, and ferrets face limitations due to the inability of mers-cov to replicate in the respiratory tracts of these species. small animals (mice or hamsters) resisting natural infection with mers-covs (which are susceptible to sars-cov) have been genetically modified to a more humanized structure, e.g., hdpp4 human, hdpp4-transduced, and hdpp4-tg mice (transgenic for expressing hdpp4), and ascertained for susceptibility to mers-cov infection. 55 alteration in the mouse genome using the crispr-cas9 gene-editing tool could make the animals susceptible to cov infection and virus replication. 56 genetic engineering was used in the generation of 288-330 +/+ mers-cov mouse model, which is being used for the evaluation of novel mers-cov vaccines and drugs. 57 compared to the large animal models, small animals such as mice and rabbits are preferred due to lower cost, ease of manipulation, and readily available efficacy methods. 43 further studies are needed to recognize suitable models for emerging sars-cov-2 by identifying receptor affinity of sars-cov-2 and studying disease manifestations, pathologies/viral pathogenesis associated with experimental inoculation of the virus in mice, rats, and other models, as well as examining virus-specific immune responses and protection. this would facilitate preclinical evaluations of candidate covid-19 vaccines and drugs.several permissive cell lines to hcovs including monkey epithelial cell lines (llc-mk2 and vero-b4) have been used in neutralization assays for assessing neutralization titers of antibody preparations. goat lung cells, alpaca kidney cells, and dromedary umbilical cord cells have been found to be permissive for mers-cov. 58 sars-cov s protein has been found to mediate entry into hepatoma cell lines, targeted by neutralizing antibodies in virus-infected patients. 59 advanced ex-vivo 3d tracheobronchial tissue (mimicking epithelium of conductive airway) has been used for human covs. 60 moreover, vlps displaying sars-cov s protein were found competent for entry to permissive cells or transfected cells that overexpress virus receptors. 59,61,62 sars-cov-2 isolation has been attempted in vero and the huh-7 cells (human liver cancer cells). 63 pseudotyped virions/vlps encoding reporter systems such as gfp or luciferase can be used for quantification and evaluation of the effectiveness of mabs and drugs in inhibiting the cellular entry of covs. 64 assays using pseudotyped virions/vlps can be performed in bsl-2 facility since these do not use infectious virus. a safety concern for passive immunization with antibodies is a possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of virus replication. antibodies with modified fc fragments or without fc fragment, e.g., human single-chain antibodies (scfv), fab, or f(ab′) 2 are safe alternatives.several mabs (fully human or humanized) that target both the s1-rbd and non-rbd as well as s2 domain of covs have been generated and tested in cell cultures for virusneutralizing capability as well as in animal models for prophylactic and post-exposure efficacies. 65 these antibodies could be useful tools also in the development of vaccines, therapeutic drugs, and antiviral inhibitors.data from animal cov vaccination suggest that systemic humoral or cell-mediated immune responses induced by parenteral administration may not be adequate to prevent respiratory tract infection. 66 because respiratory mucosa is the initial site in cov infection and transmission, mucosal immunization, such as using intranasal vaccine, 67 could be an effective strategy for prophylaxis by induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses. the molecular mechanisms of mucosal and systemic immunological factors are different, such that it is difficult to predict the surrogate marker for cov efficacy. the best surrogate assays for protection as well as herd immunity toward different cov infections warrant detailed investigations.the main measure in clinical management is focused on alleviating clinical symptoms and supportive care. [68] [69] [70] therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for covid-19 include molecules binding to the virus, molecules, or inhibitors that target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, small-molecule inhibitors targeting helicase, essential proteases, or other proteins of the virus, host cell protease inhibitors, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, sirna, anti-sense rna and ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mabs targeting host receptor or interfere with s1 rbd, antiviral peptide targeting s2, and natural products. 2, 11 there is a long list of anti-cov agents, mostly preclinical compounds yet to be evaluated as anti-covid-19 agents. some of these agents are in phase iii trials for covid-19, including remdesivir, oseltamivir, asc09f (hiv protease inhibitor), lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and cobicistat. 71 many existing mers-and/or sars-covs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy. the rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) sequence of sars-cov-2 has shown 96% identity to that of sars-cov, a critical finding since drugs developed for sars-cov rdrp might show similar efficacy for sars-cov -2 rdrp. 28 s protein is considered the major target for designing cov antiviral therapies such as s protein inhibitors, s cleavage inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, rbd-ace2 blockers, sirnas, fusion core blockers, and protease inhibitors. 19 all such therapeutic strategies have shown potential in vitro and/ or in vivo anti-cov activities. comparatively, even though in vitro studies performed with these agents have shown efficacy, most of them lack sufficient support due to the lack of randomized animal or human trials, hence of limited use for covid-19. hence, the necessary support of extensive animal and human trials is required for such therapeutics to become useful. the binding of covid-19 and ace2 affects the balance of renin-angiotensin system (ras), potentially leading to exacerbation of severe pneumonia. thus, it is speculated that acei and angiotensin type-1 receptor (at1r) inhibitors might be able to reduce pulmonary inflammatory responses, thereby reducing the mortality. 72 the guidance to covid-19 control might be based on existing measures for mers and sars, with some further precautions due to the unknown nature of this new cov. 14, 73 the main treatments such as mechanical ventilation, icu admission, and symptomatic and supportive care are recommended for severe cases. furthermore, rna synthesis inhibitors (like 3tc, tdf), remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (ek1), anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, chinese traditional medicine, such as lianhuaqingwen and shufengjiedu capsules, could be the promising covid-19 treatments. 2 however, further clinical trials are required for confirming safety and efficacy for covid-19. a major limiting factor in the quest for identifying an ideal vaccine or therapeutic agent is time. it may take months to even several years for researchers to develop, produce, standardize, evaluate, approve, and commercialize therapeutic agents for covid-19. hence, current efforts should be directed toward identifying and evaluating drugs and immunotherapeutics that have proven efficacy against viruses similar to covid-19.the time required for drug discovery programs to develop, evaluate, and obtain approval for a new potent anti-covid-19 agent could take more than 10 years. 4 in the present scenario, the development of a new therapeutic agent for covid-19 is not a feasible option with regard to available time. another option is to repurpose broadly acting antiviral drugs used for other viral infections. such drugs have the advantage of easy availability, known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, solubility, stability, side effects, and also well-established dosing regimens. 4 repurposed drugs are potential therapeutic options managing cov infections. repurposed drugs such as lopinavir/ ritonavir and interferon-1β possess in vitro anti-mers-cov activity. the in vivo study conducted in common marmosets (non-human primate model) showed that animals treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-1β had better outcomes than untreated animals. 74 the combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-1β is being evaluated for mers in the miracle trial. 75 the same two protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, when combined with ribavirin, were found to be associated with favorable clinical responses in sars patients indicating therapeutic efficacy. 10 as an early attempt to evaluate these repurposed drugs in covid-19, a controlled trial of ritonavirboosted lopinavir and interferon-α 2b therapy has been registered for hospitalized patients in china (chictr2000029308). 76 oral administration of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir has been used as an empirical drug for covid-19 suspected cases in china hospitals even though there is no evidence of its efficacy. 2 recently, the in vitro antiviral efficacy of approved drugs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, and chloroquine was compared with that of the two broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipiravir for covid-19. among the evaluated drugs, both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling covid-19 in vitro. 63 the study also pointed out that the three nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, and favipiravir may not have significant in vivo antiviral effects against covid-19 since higher concentrations were required to reduce the viral infection in vitro. both remdesivir and chloroquine are being used for the treatment of other diseases and have a well-defined safety profile. hence, such drugs can be used for evaluating their efficacy in patients of novel cov infections.achievements in the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents for sars-and mers-cov as well as recent ongoing progress for covid-19 will facilitate the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against this emerging virus. however, the present scenario of covid-19 warrants the need for implementing robust preventive and control measures due to the potential for nosocomial infections. 77 we need to rely exclusively on preventive measures since considerable time is required before efforts to develop a new vaccine or antiviral agent becomes fruitful.researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly covid-19. there are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for covid-19. hence, we have to rely exclusively on enforcing strict preventive and control measures that minimize the risk of possible disease transmission. results obtained from the recently conducted in vitro study against covid-19 are promising since the drugs remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling the infection. direct clinical trials can be conducted among the patients infected with covid-19 since these drugs are being used for treating other diseases and have well-established safety profiles, making the further evaluation of these drugs much easier. s protein is considered a key viral antigen for developing cov vaccines, as shown in several preclinical studies. although research is in progress to improve prevention, treatment, and control of covid-19, the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for covs are scarce. further research should be directed toward the study of sars-cov-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis.coronaviruses (cov) first became widely known after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2002. they are are positive, single-strand rna viruses that often infect birds and a variety of mammals and sometimes migrate to humans [1] . while coronaviruses that infect humans usually present mild symptoms (e.g. 15% of cases involving the common cold are caused by a coronavirus), several previous outbreaks, such as sars and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) [2] , have caused significant fatalities in infected populations [3] .in december 2019, several patients with a connection in wuhan, china developed symptoms of viral pneumonia. sequencing of viral rna determined that these cases were caused by a novel coronavirus named 2019-ncov or sars-cov-2 [4, 5] . the virus has infected more than 51,857 people across 26 countries as of february 16th 2020 according to a world health organization report [6] . covid-19, the disease caused by 2019-ncov, has led to death of 1666 patients and is clearly transmissible between humans [3] .the deployment of a vaccine against 2019-ncov would arrest its infection rate and help protect vulnerable populations. however, no vaccine has yet passed beyond clinical trails for any coronavirus, whether in humans or other animals [7, 8] . in animal models, inactivated whole virus vaccines without focused immune epitopes offer incomplete protection [8] . vaccines for sars-cov and mers-cov have also resulted in hypersensitivity and immunopathologic responses in mice [9, 7] . the diversity among coronavirus strains presents another challenge [9, 1] , as there are at least 6 distinct subgroups in the coronavirus genus. and while sars-cov and 2019-ncov share the same subgroup (2b), their genomes are only 77% identical [4] . understanding the shared and unique epitopes of 2019-ncov will help the field design better vaccines or diagnostic tests for patients. (orfs) . the s protein is a target for antibodies and we model its 3d structure with discotope2 to identify likely binding sites (b-cell epitopes). we scan peptide sequences from individual viral protein with netmhcpan4 and maria for mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation respectively to identify potential t-cell epitopes. our mhc-i analysis include common alleles for hla-a, hla-b, and hla-c, and our mhc-ii analysis include common alleles of hla-dr.against viruses, only neutralizing antibodies can fully block the entry of viruses into human cells [12] . the location of antibody binding sites on a viral protein strongly affects the body's ability to produce neutralizing antibodies; for example, hiv has buried surface proteins that protect themselves from human antibodies [13] . for this reason, it would be valuable to understand whether 2019-ncov has potential antibody binding sites (b-cell epitopes) near their interacting surface with its known human entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2).beyond neutralizing antibodies, human bodies also rely upon cytotoxic cd8 t-cells and helper cd4 t-cells to fully clear viruses. the presentation of viral peptides by human major histocompatibility complex (mhc or hla) class i and class ii is essential for anti-viral t-cell responses [14] . in contrast to b-cell epitopes, t-cell epitopes can be located anywhere in a viral protein since human cells can process and present both intracellular and extracellular viral peptides [15] .these immunology principles guide the design of our current study (fig. 1) . first we focus on t-cell epitopes. 2019-ncov carries 4 major structural proteins-spike (s), membrane (m), envelope (e) and nucleocapsid (n)-and at least 6 other open reading frames (orfs) [1, 16] . all protein fragments have the potential to be presented by mhc-i or mhc-ii and recognized by t-cells. we apply netmhcpan4 [17] and maria [15] , two artificial neural network algorithms, to predict antigen presentation and identify potential t-cell epitopes.next we focus on b-cell epitopes. the spike (s) protein is the main trans-membrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of 2019-ncov and is responsible for receptor binding and virion entry to cells [1, 18] . we narrow our b-cell epitope search to s protein since it is the most likely target of human neutralizing antibodies. discopte2 uses a combination of amino acid sequences and protein surface properties to predict antibody binding sites given a protein structure [19] . we use this tool to identify potential 2019-ncov b-cell epitopes as the co-crystal structure of 2019-ncov's spike protein and antibody is yet available.finally, we examine the viral mutation pattern. thanks to global sequencing efforts [20] , we are able to obtain a cohort of 68 2019-ncov genomes from four continents. based on the resulting viral mutation profile, we examine whether mutations are driven by the immune selection pressure. highly mutated regions might be excluded from the vaccine candidate pool.we obtained 2019-ncov (sars-cov-2019) and sars-cov reference sequence data from ncbi genebank (nc_045512 and nc_004718) [16, 4] . we then extracted the 2019-ncov protein sequences of orf1ab, s, orf3a, e, m, orf6, orf7a, orf7b, orf8, n, and orf10 based on the reference genome. we obtained viral sequences associated with 68 patients from gisaid on feb 1st 2020 (supplementary table 1 ) [20] . genomes with single protein are not included in the analysis.we broke each gene sequence in 2019-ncov into sliding windows of length 9, the median length of mhc-i ligands, and 15, the median length of mhc-ii ligands. we used netmhcpan4 [17] and maria [15] to predict mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation scores, respectively. we used 32 mhc alleles common in the chinese population (>4% allele frequency, 7 hla-a, 8 hla-b, 9 hla-c, 8 hla-drb1), as determined by an analysis of human populations [21] . the complete list of common mhc alleles is included in supplementary table 2 .both maria and netmhcpan4 return percentiles that characterize a peptide's likelihood of presentation relative to preset distribution of random human peptide scores. prior work recommends thresholds of 98% for netmhcpan4 and 95% for maria to determine reasonable presenters. we also applied our analysis with a more stringent 99.5% threshold for both netmhcpan4 and maria. we used gene expression values of 50 tpm when running maria to reflect the high expression values of viral genes in human cells.when aggregating alleles across mhc-i and mhc-ii to report overall coverage, we marked a peptide sequence as covered if it is presented by more then 33% of common alleles. we chose 33% as a cut-off because it suggests a high (>90%) probability that at least one allele can present this peptide assuming the patient carries six mhc alleles (e.g. 2 as, 2 bs, and 2 cs) and the distribution of common mhc alleles in the population is random. we ranked potential t-cell epitopes based on their mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation coverage across alleles.we applied our methodology to known sars t-cell epitopes and non-epitope sars peptides to estimate our ability to predict 2019-ncov epitopes. for mhc-i, we curated 17 experimentally determined hla-a*02:01 associated cd8 t-cell epitopes and 1236 non-epitope 9mer sliding windows on sars s protein [22, 23, 24] . for mhc-ii, we curated 3 experimentally determined cd4 t-cell epitopes and 246 non-epitopes on sars s protein [25] . no specific hla-dr alleles were reported in the original study, so we used hla-drb1*09:01 and 15:01 (common alleles) to run maria. to calculate sensitivity and specificity for this validation set, we labeled any peptide sequence above the 98th (mhc-i) or 95th (mhc-ii) percentile as a positive epitope prediction. any sequence below that threshold we labeled as a negative prediction. we calculated auc scores (auroc) to estimate the overall performance of our methodology.we obtained an approximate 3d structure of 2019-ncov s protein by homology modeling sars s protein (pdb: 6acc) with swiss-model [26, 27] . s proteins from 2019-ncov and sars share 93% similarity. the modeled structure of 2019-ncov s protein has a qmean of -3.63 table 1 : summary of potential 2019-ncov t-cell epitope candidates based on hla antigen presentation scores. the hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, and hla-dr columns refer to the number of peptide sequences that were predicted to present across more than one third of common alleles among the chinese population. length refers to the number of amino acids in a given gene. hla-c are more likely to present 2019-ncov antigens across one third of alleles compared to hla-a or b.fisher's exact test p-value levels are indicated with * * * (< 0.001), * * (< 0.01), and * (< 0.05).(supplementary file 1). we used a computational docking algorithm, cluspro2 [28] , to estimate the interactive surface of 2019-ncov with its known human receptor, ace2 [5] (supplementary file 2). graphic rendering and analysis was performed with pymol [29] .we predicted likely human antibody binding sites (b-cell epitopes) on sars and 2019-ncov s protein with disctope2 [19] . our analysis focused on neutralizing binding sites by only examining residues 1-600. the full prediction results can be found in supplementary we aimed to determine whether there was any statistical relationship between regions of mutation and presentation. we translated viral genome sequences into protein sequences using biopython [33] and indexes from the ncbi reference genome. 2019-ncov nucleotide position 13468 contains a -1 frame shift signal and we adjusted accordingly to generate orf1ab. we compared protein sequences from 68 patients to the reference sequence to identify mutations with edit distance analysis. positions with poor quality reads (e.g. w or y) were excluded from the analysis. the full sequence and mutation profiles can be found in supplementary we computed fisher's exact test with scipy [34] and auroc with scikit-learn [35] .we scanned 11 2019-ncov genes with netmhcpan4 and maria to identify regions highly presentable by hla complexes (human mhc). a epitope is labeled positive if presentable by more than one third of common alleles among the chinese population. we display a summary of our t-cell epitope findings in table 1 . in fig. 2 we show regions of strong mhc presentation across hla-a, hla-b, hla-c, and hla-dr alleles, both at a medium threshold ( fig. 2a) , and at a high threshold ( fig. 2b) . consistent with the similar finding from sars-cov, proteins orf1ab, s, and e contain high numbers of presentable antigen sequences across both mhc-i and mhc-ii [8] . these highly presentable peptides on functional viral proteins provide a candidate pool for t-cell epitope identifications and epitope-focused vaccine design. the presentation scores of individual antigen peptides can be found in supplementary table 5, 6.netmhcpan4 predicts that a larger number of 2019-ncov protein sequences can be presented by hla-c alleles across all genes (fisher's exact test, p = 4.2e −59 ) compared to hla-a or hla-b (table 1) . specifically, orf1ab (p = 6.7e −54 ), s (p = 1.4e −9 ), orf3a (p = 0.01), and m (p = 0.025) can be better presented by hla-c alleles after bonferroni correction. this might be due to relatively conserved hla-c binding motif on the 9th position (the main anchor residue) where leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine are commonly favored across alleles [36] . hla-c*07:02, hla-c*01:02, and hla-c*06:02 all have >10% allele frequency in the chinese population [21] . this suggests the future epitope-based vaccines should include hla-c related epitopes beyond the common hla-a*02:01 and hla-b*40:01 approach.to estimate the ability of antigen presentation scores to identify 2019-ncov t-cell epitopes, we performed a validation study with known sars-cov cd8 and cd4 t-cell epitopes (fig. 3) . the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . figure 3 : validation of netmhcpan and maria for t-cell epitope identification with sars-cov s protein epitopes. netmhcpan4 and maria presentation percentiles were used to differentiate experimentally identified cd8 t-cell epitopes (mhc-i, n=17) [22, 23, 24] and cd4 t-cell epitopes (mhc-ii, n=3) [25] from negative peptides (n=1236 and 246). negative peptides for cd8 t-cell epitopes are all 9mer sliding windows of s protein without a reported epitope. negative peptides for cd4 t-cell epitopes are experimentally tested. a) netmhcpan4 has a sensitivity of 82.3% and specificity of 97.0% with a 98th presentation percentile cut-off, and an overall auc of 0.98. b) maria has a sensitivity of 66.6% and specificity of 91.1% with a 95th presentation percentile cut-off, and an overall auc of 0.83. independent experimental studies [22, 23, 24, 25] , we identified known cd8 t-cell epitopes (mhc-i, n=17) and known cd4 t-cell epitopes (mhc-ii, n=3). we also obtained known non-epitopes (n=1236 and 246) for cd4, while for cd8 we include all 9mer sliding windows of s protein without a known epitope as non-epitopes. mhc-i presentation (with recommended cut-off 98% [17] ) has a sensitivity of 82.3%, specificity of 97.0% and an auc of 0.98 (fig. 3a) . mhc-ii presentation (recommended cut-off 95% [15] ) has a sensitivity of 66.6%, specificity of 91.1% and an auc of 0.83 (fig. 3b) .given the high similarity between sars-cov and 2019-ncov proteins, we expect our analysis on 2019-ncov to perform similarly against future experimentally validated t-cell epitopes. the detailed scores and sequences of this analysis can be found in supplementary table 7 and 8.human immune selection pressure has been shown to drive viral mutations which evade immune surveillance (e.g. low mhc presentation). we hypothesize that a similar phenomenon can occur in 2019-ncov. we curated a cohort of 68 viral genomes across four continents and identified 93 point mutations, 2 nonsense mutation and 1 deletion mutation compared to the published reference genome [5] . we plot point mutations against regions of mhc-i or mhc-ii presentation in fig. 4 . the full protein sequence and mutation information can be found in supplementary table 9 , 10.mutations occur in most genes with the exception of e, orf6, orf7b, and n. we identify a recurrent mutation l84s in orf8 in 20 samples. mutations are more likely to occur in regions with mhc-i presentation (fischer's exact test, p = 0.02). no relationship was observed with mhc-ii (p = 0.58) or an aggregate of mhc-i and mhc-ii (p = 0.14). this is consistent with the role of cd8 t-cell in clearing infected cells and mutations supporting the evasion of immune surveillance [37] . be presented by multiple mhc alleles as indicated in our heatmap (fig. 4) . in a sample from japan (epi_isl_407084), the viral gene orf1ab loses nucleotides 94-118, which code for gdsveevl. an associated antigen fgdsveevl is predicted to be good presented by multiple mhc-i alleles (e.g. 99.9% for hla-c*08:01, 99.2% for hla-c*01:02, and 99.0% for hla-b*39:01).in summary, we observed that 2019-ncov mutations often occur among or delete presentable peptides, a potential form of immune evasion. patient mhc allele information and t-cell profiling are needed to better assess this phenomenon. however, patients typically carry fewer than 3 mutations, so a vaccine against multiple epitopes will not be nullified by such a small number of mutations.we obtained the likely 3d structure of 2019-ncov's spike protein (supplementary file 1) by homology modeling with sars-cov's spike protein (pdb: 6acc). we scanned both spike protein structures with discotope2 to identify potential antibody binding sites on the protein surface (fig. 5) . for the sars-cov s protein, we identified a strong cluster of antibody sites (>30 residues, pink or red) on the receptor binding domain (rbd, the ace2 interacting surface). three independent studies [32, 30, 31 ] discovered b-cell epitopes in this region (blue) with a combination of in vitro and ex vivo approaches. additionally, discotope2 identifies residue 541-555 as another binding site, which was supported by two independent studies (fig. 5a, blue) [30, 31] . this gives us some confidence in the ability of discotope2 to predict b-cell epitopes if given a unknown protein structure.for the 2019-ncov s protein, discotope2 identified a similar antibody binding site on s protein potential rbd, but with fewer residues (17 residues, fig. 5b ). with computational protein-protein docking, we predicted one potential interacting conformation between the 2019-ncov s protein and the human ace2 entry receptor (fig. 5c) . the main antibody binding site substantially overlaps with the interacting surface where ace2 binds to s protein, and an antibody binding to this surface is likely to block viral entry into cells. discotope2 identified anther antibody binding site (residue 246-257) different from sars-cov but with lower scores (>-2.5 raw scores). 3d structures of both spike protein were scanned with discotope2 to assess potential antibody binding sites (b-cell epitopes). red indicates residues with score > 0.5 (cut-off for specificity of 90%), and pink indicates residues with score > -2.5 (cut-off for specificity of 80%). a) the receptor binding domain (rbd) of sars spike protein has concentrated high score residues and is comprised of two linear epitopes. one additional binding site is predicted to be around residue 541-555. three independent experimental studies [32, 30, 31] identify patient antibodies recognize these three linear epitopes (blue). b) 2019-ncov spike protein is predicted to have a similar strong antibody binding site near rbd and an additional site around residue 246-257. c) the predicted antibody binding site on 2019-ncov rbd potentially overlaps with the interacting surface for the known human entry receptor ace2 (yellow). d) eight 2019-ncov spike protein point mutations are present in a cohort of 68 viral samples. no mutations are near the ace2 interacting surface. one mutation (s247r) occurs near one of the predicted antibody binding sites (residue 246-257). table 2 : top potential epitopes for key 2019-ncov proteins. we ranked epitopes based on their likely coverage of presentation by mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles. s protein 494-508 is highly ranked based on mhc presentation and is also one of the predicted top b-cell epitopes, localized near the s protein receptor binding domain ( figure 5 ). mhc-i coverage is calculated by the 9mer with the highest mhc-i coverage for each epitope (highlighted in orange). all candidates are likely to be presented by both mhc-i and mhc-ii. a question mark (?) under the antibody column indicates that one or more sars homolog of this peptide is a known b-cell epitopewe identified 8 point mutation sites on s protein from a cohort of 68 2019-ncov samples (fig. 5d ).all mutations are apart from the protein s rbd, and one mutation (s247r) occurs near one of the predicted minor antibody binding site (residue 246-257).in summary, we observed major structural and b-cell epitope similarity between sars-cov and 2019-ncov spike proteins. a recent cryo-em study of 2019-ncov s protein [18] supports such structural similarity, and it would be informative to rerun our analysis once the cryo-em crystal structure becomes publicly available. rbds in both proteins seem to be important b-cell epitopes for neutralizing antibodies, however, sars-cov appears to have larger attack surface than 2019-ncov (fig. 5a, 5b) . fortunately, we have not observed any mutations altering binding sites for this major b-cell epitope in 2019-ncov.after understanding the landscape of t-cell and b-cell epitopes of 2019-ncov, we summarize our results in table 2 for promising candidates for 2019-ncov vaccines. ideal antigens should be presented by multiple mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles in a general population and contain linear b-cell epitopes associated with neutralizing antibodies. specifically, we first identified regions with high coverage of mhc-ii, then ranked them based on their mhc-i coverage. we further search these top candidates with 90% sequence similarity on iedb [38] to assess whether any candidate has been previously reported for being a b-cell epitope or t-cell epitope.around 1000 peptide 15mers can be presented by a wide range of mhc-ii (>33%), which is consistent with our knowledge about promiscuity of mhc-ii presentation [15, 39] . when further requiring a peptide to be presented by more than 33% or 66% of common mhc-i alleles, we narrowed the results to 405 or 44 promising t-cell epitopes, respectively (supplementary table 5 , 6). the top 13 candidates in key viral proteins can be presented by 52-83% of mhc-i alleles ( table 2) . most notably, s protein 494-508 is not only a good mhc presenter but also a predicted b-cell epitope near the s protein receptor binding domain (fig. 5b) , which indicates a good vaccine candidate.in summary, we analyzed the 2019-ncov viral genome for epitope candidates and found 405 likely t-cell epitopes, with strong mhc-i and mhc-ii presentation scores, and 2 potential neutralizing b-cell epitopes on s protein. we validated our methodology by running a similar analysis on sars-cov against known sars t-cell and b-cell epitopes. inspecting 68 samples, we found that viral mutations have a tendency to occur in regions with strong mhc-i presentation, which can be a form of immune evasion. however, no mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain which is critical for viral entrance to cells and neutralizing antibody binding.similar to sars-cov [1, 8] , the 2019-ncov spike protein is likely to be immunogenic as it carries a number of both t-cell and b-cell epitopes. recombinant surface protein vaccines have demonstrated strong clinical utilities in hepatitis b and human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccines [11, 45] . a recombinant 2019-ncov spike protein vaccine combined with other top epitopes and an appropriate adjuvant could be a reasonable next step for 2019-ncov vaccine development.from an economic perspective, the development of coronavirus vaccines faces significant financial hurdles as most such viruses do not cause endemic infections. after an epidemic episode (e.g. sars) there is little financial incentive for private companies to develop vaccines against a specific strain of virus [10, 2, 8] . to address these incentive issues, governments might provide greater funding support to create vaccines against past and future outbreaks.our pipeline provides a framework to identify strong epitope-based vaccine candidates-beyond 2019-ncov-and might be applied against any unknown pathogens. previous animal studies do show antigens with high mhc presentation scores are more likely to elicit strong t-cell responses, but the correlation between vaccine efficacy and t-cell responses is relatively weak [14, 46, 7] . when combined with future clinical data, our work can help the field untangle the relationship between antigen presentation scores and vaccine efficacy.supplementary by t-cells. we apply netmhcpan4 (17) and maria (15), 62 two artificial neural network algorithms, to predict antigen 63the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. there is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human t-cells and b-cells (known as epitopes).here we identify potential t-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as b-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure. we identify a list of top candidates, including an epitope located on 2019-ncov spike protein that potentially triggers both t-cell and b-cell responses. analyzing 68 samples, we observe that viral mutations are more likely to happen in regions with strong antigen presentation, a potential form of immune evasion. our computational pipeline is validated with experimental data from sars-cov.b.c. and e.f. designed the study and implemented the analysis pipeline, and drafted the manuscript. r.a.

presented by hla-c alleles across all 103 genes (fisher's exact test, p = 4.2e −59 ) compared to hla-a 104 or hla-b (table 1) . specifically, orf1ab (p = 6.7e −54 ), s 105 (p = 1.4e −9 ), orf3a (p = 0.01), and m (p = 0.025) can be 106 better presented by hla-c alleles after bonferroni correction. 107 t-cell epitope validation. to estimate the ability of antigen 108 presentation scores to identify 2019-ncov t-cell epitopes, we 109 performed a validation study with known sars-cov cd8 and 110 cd4 t-cell epitopes (fig. 3) . from 4 independent experimen-111 tal studies (23-26), we identified known cd8 t-cell epitopes 112 (mhc-i, n=17) and known cd4 t-cell epitopes (mhc-ii, 113 n=3). we also obtained known non-epitopes (n=1236 and 114 246) for cd4, while for cd8 we include all 9mer sliding win-115 dows of s protein without a known epitope as non-epitopes. 116 mhc-i presentation (with recommended cut-off 98% (17)) has 117 a sensitivity of 82.3%, specificity of 97.0% and an auc of 0.98 118 (fig. 3a) . mhc-ii presentation (recommended cut-off 95% 119 (15)) has a sensitivity of 66.6%, specificity of 91.1% and an 120 auc of 0.83 (fig. 3b ).given the high similarity between sars-cov and 2019-122 ncov proteins, we expect our analysis on 2019-ncov to per-123 form similarly against future experimentally validated t-cell 124 epitopes. the detailed scores and sequences of this analysis 125 can be found in si appendix, supplementary tables 7 and 8 . 126 viral mutation and antigen presentation. human immune se-127 lection pressure has been shown to drive viral mutations which 128 evade immune surveillance (e.g. low mhc presentation). we 129 hypothesize that a similar phenomenon can occur in 2019-130 ncov. we curated a cohort of 68 viral genomes across four 131 continents and identified 93 point mutations, 2 nonsense mu-132 tation and 1 deletion mutation compared to the published 133 reference genome (5). we plot point mutations against regions 134 of mhc-i or mhc-ii presentation in fig. 4 . the full pro-135 tein sequence and mutation information can be found in si 136 appendix, dataset s2 and s3. we plot results at both medium (a) and high (b) cut-offs for presentation. the x-axis indicates the position of each viral protein, and the y-axis indicates each human hla gene family. each blue stripe indicates the fraction of hla alleles that can present a 9mer or 15mer viral peptide starting from a given position. a peptide being presented by more than one third of common alleles (red) is considered to be high coverage. fig. s1 ).notably, the cryo-em solved structure has missing residues 178 in the rbd due to limited electron density. using modeled 179 structures overcomes this issue. fig. 6 ). we wanted to 204 explore whether these two linear epitopes are critical for viral 205 interaction with the human entry protein ace2. after our 206 original analysis, two solved co-crystal structures of 2019-ncov 207 s protein rbd and human ace2 become available (19, 20). 208 we ran discotope2 and obtained strikingly similar results 209 (fig. 6c and d) . the main antibody binding site substantially 210 overlaps with the interacting surface where ace2 (yellow) 211 binds to s protein, so an antibody binding to this surface is 212 likely to block viral entry into cells. table 2 . top potential epitopes for key 2019-ncov proteins. we ranked epitopes based on their likely coverage of presentation by mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles. s protein 494-508 is highly ranked based on mhc presentation and is also one of the predicted top b-cell epitopes, localized near the s protein receptor binding domain (fig. 5) . mhc-i coverage is calculated by the 9mer with the highest mhc-i coverage for each epitope (highlighted in orange). all candidates are likely to be presented by both mhc-i and mhc-ii. "sars" under the antibody column indicates that one or more sars homolog of this peptide is a known b-cell epitope. from an economic perspective, the development of coro-295 navirus vaccines faces significant financial hurdles as most 296 such viruses do not cause endemic infections. after an epi-297 demic episode (e.g. sars) there is little financial incentive 298 for private companies to develop vaccines against a specific 299 strain of virus (2, 8, 10). to address these incentive issues, 300 governments might provide greater funding support to create 301 vaccines against past and future outbreaks.our pipeline provides a framework to identify strong 303 epitope-based vaccine candidates and might be applied against 304 any unknown pathogens. we were able to model structures 305 of 2019-ncov spike protein as soon as the dna sequence be-306 came available, and the modeled structure has high similarity 307 with later solved crystal structures (si appendix, fig. s1 ). 308 this suggests the researchers can rely on homology remodeling 309 when emerging pathogens first appear if the new pathogen 310 shares high sequence similarity with an existing pathogen.previous animal studies show antigens with high mhc pre-312 sentation scores are more likely to elicit strong t-cell responses, 313 but the correlation between these responses and vaccine ef-314 ficacy is relatively weak (7, 14, 43). when combined with 315 future clinical data, our work can help the field untangle the 316 relationship between antigen presentation and vaccine efficacy. 317we obtained 2019-ncov (sars-cov-2019) and sars-cov ref-319 erence sequence data from ncbi genebank (nc_045512 and 320 nc_004718) (4, 16). we obtained viral sequences associated with 321 68 patients from gisaid on feb 1st 2020. 322 we broke each gene sequence in 2019-ncov into sliding windows 323 and used netmhcpan4 (17) and maria (15) to predict mhc-i 324 and mhc-ii presentation scores across 32 mhc alleles common 325 in the chinese population (41) . we marked a peptide sequence as 326 covered by mhc-i and mhc-ii if it is presented by more then 33% 327 of constituent alleles. for validation, we applied our methodology 328 to known sars t-cell epitopes and non-epitopes. 329 we predicted likely human antibody binding sites (b-cell epi-330 topes) on sars and 2019-ncov s protein with disctope2 (21) 331 after first obtaining an approximate 3d structure of 2019-ncov s 332 protein by homology modeling sars s protein (pdb: 6acc) with 333 swiss-model (31, 44). to validate our b-cell epitope predictions, 334 we compared our top 3 b-cell epitopes for sars s protein with 335 previously experimentally identified epitopes (28-30).for mutation identification, we translated viral genome sequences 337 from patients into protein sequences and compared them with the 338 reference sequence to identify mutations with edit distance analysis.we compared positions of point mutations with mhc-i or mhc-ii 340 presentable regions in the protein with fisher's exact test.lin for the discussion about coronaviruses. we thank all labs 343 contributing to the global efforts of sequencing 2019-ncov sam-344 ples and we attached the full acknowledgment list in si appendix,the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, covid-19, caused by the new coronavirus 2019-ncov that is now officially designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sars-cov-2, represents a pandemic threat to global public health. 1, 2 although the epicenter of the covid-19 outbreak in december of 2019 was located in wuhan, china, this disease has spread to more than 100 countries ( figure 1 ) with over 100 000 confirmed cases and over 3,800 confirmed deaths worldwide ( figure 2 ) as of march 9, 2020 . 3 in addition, millions of people's lives have been affected as a result of mandatory isolations/ quarantines. the ripple effect of the covid-19 outbreak could potentially bring major challenges to worldwide health systems and have far-reaching consequences on the global economy if the spread of the virus is not effectively controlled. 1, 2, 4 coronaviruses (covs) are relatively large viruses containing a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope. the viral membrane is studded with glycoprotein spikes that give coronaviruses their crownlike appearance (figure 3 ). while coronaviruses infect both humans and animals, certain types of animals such as bats that host the largest variety of coronaviruses appear to be immune to coronavirus-induced illness. 5 there are four classes of coronaviruses designated as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. the betacoronavirus class includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) virus (sars-cov), middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) virus (mers-cov), and the covid-19 causative agent sars-cov-2. similar to sars-cov and mers-cov, sars-cov-2 attacks the lower respiratory system to cause viral pneumonia, but it may also affect the gastrointestinal system, heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system leading to multiple organ failure. 6, 7 current information indicates that sars-cov-2 is more transmissible/contagious than sars-cov. 8 since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease covid-19, caused by the sars-cov-2 virus, this disease has spread rapidly around the globe. considering the potential threat of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the pathophysiology of this disease to uncover possible treatment regimens and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines. to support the current research and development, cas has produced a special report to provide an overview of published scientific information with an emphasis on patents in the cas content collection. it highlights antiviral strategies involving small molecules and biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication. the drug-repurposing effort documented herein focuses primarily on agents known to be effective against other rna viruses including sars-cov and mers-cov. the patent analysis of coronavirusrelated biologics includes therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, and nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression as well as various types of vaccines. more than 500 patents disclose methodologies of these four biologics with the potential for treating and preventing coronavirus infections, which may be applicable to covid-19. the information included in this report provides a strong intellectual groundwork for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and vaccines.the betacoronavirus genome encodes several structural proteins, including the glycosylated spike (s) protein that functions as a major inducer of host immune responses. this s protein mediates host cell invasion by both sars-cov and sars-cov-2 via binding to a receptor protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) located on the surface membrane of host cells. 9−11 a recent study also revealed that this invasion process requires s protein priming which is facilitated by the host cellproduced serine protease tmprss211. in addition, the viral genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins including rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), coronavirus main protease (3clpro), and papain-like protease (plpro). 12, 13 upon entrance to the host cells, the viral genome is released as a single-stranded positive rna. subsequently, it is translated into viral polyproteins using host cell protein translation machinery, which are then cleaved into effector proteins by viral proteinases 3clpro and plpro. 12, 13 plpro also behaves as a deubiquitinase that may deubiquinate certain host cell proteins, including interferon factor 3 and nf-κb, resulting in immune suppression. 13, 14 rdrp synthesizes a full-length negative-strand rna template to be used by rdrp to make more viral genomic rna.the interaction between viral s protein and ace2 on the host cell surface is of significant interest since it initiates the infection process. cryo-em structure analysis has revealed that the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 s protein to ace2 is about 10−20 times higher than that of sars-cov s protein. 10, 15 it is speculated that this may contribute to the reported higher transmissibility and contagiousness of sars-cov-2 as compared to sars-cov. 8 the prospect also exists for discovery of therapeutic agents targeting the highly conserved proteins associated with both sars-cov and sars-cov-2. 15−18 rdrp and 3clpro protease of sars-cov-2 share over 95% of sequence similarity with those of sars-cov despite the fact that these two viruses demonstrate only 79% sequence similarity at the genome level. 15−18 on the basis of sequence alignment and homology modeling, sars-cov and sars-cov-2 share a highly conserved receptor-binding domain (rbd), a domain of s protein, and 76% of sequence similarity in their s proteins. 15−18 in addition, although the plpro sequences of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov are only 83% similar, they share similar active sites. 16 to date, there are no sars-cov-2-specific antiviral agents. researchers have been racing to find possible treatments to save lives and produce vaccines for future prevention. to support research and development efforts to discover effective therapeutic and preventive agents for covid-19, cas, a division of the american chemical society specializing in scientific information solutions, has analyzed scientific data related to the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines for human coronaviruses since 2003. the analyses presented in this report are based on the cas content collection, a scientist-curated data collection covering published scientific literature and patents from over 60 patent authorities worldwide. for a subset of the analyses, both cas and medline data were collectively analyzed.to covid-19, sars, and mers trend in scientific publications related to covid-19.since the outbreak of covid-19, this new disease and its causative virus have drawn major global attention. scientists and physicians worldwide have been conducting a major campaign to understand this new emergent disease and its epidemiology in an effort to uncover possible treatment regimens, discover effective therapeutic agents, and develop vaccines. figure 4 shows the total number of journal articles related to covid-19 or sars-cov-2 published each week from the last week of 2019 through the week of february 24, 2020. over 500 journal articles were published electronically or in print during this period, and the number of published articles has increased each week since the week of january 13, 2020. although a large portion of these articles are about clinical manifestations and treatment options, an increasing number of studies are focused on elucidation of virus structure, virus transmission mechanisms/dynamics, as well as identification of antiviral agents and accurate diagnostics for virus detection. these trends reflect immense interest and desire from the scientific community, including both academic and industrial organizations as well as clinicians, to identify new methods to halt the progression of this epidemic disease and to prevent infection and transmission in the future.notable journal articles related to covid-19 and sars-cov-2. table 1 lists some journal articles published  from december 30, 2019 through february 23, 2020 . these articles were selected based on collective use of factors such as journal impact factor, citation, and type of study. for example, the no. 8 article listed about the characterization of the sars-cov-2 genome has greatly facilitated the global effort to develop a vaccine for prevention of covid-19. also shown in this table are journal articles pertaining to potential antiviral drug candidates such as remdesivir, baricitinib, and chloroquine for the treatment of this disease.as mentioned earlier, covid-19 is caused by sars-cov-2, a new type of coronavirus in the same genus as sars-cov and mers-cov. viral proteins responsible for sars-cov-2 entry into host cells and replication are structurally similar to those associated with sars-cov. thus, research and development on sars and mers may offer insights that would be beneficial to the development of therapeutic and preventive agents for covid-19. this report identified pertinent data from patents related to these two coronaviruses. figure 5 shows the distribution of patents in the cas content collection related to sars (a) and mers (b). the number of patents related to sars is almost 12 times the number related to mers, probably because the sars outbreak occurred about 10 years before the mers outbreak. among sars patents, about 80% are related to the development of therapeutics, 35% are related to vaccines, and 28% are related to diagnostic agents or methods. because an individual patent may cover any two or more areas, the sum of percentage values is greater than 100%. a similar distribution pattern was also observed for patents related to mers. thus, for both diseases, more patents have been devoted to the development of therapeutic agents as opposed to diagnostic methods and vaccines.identification of targets is important for identifying drugs with high target specificity and/or uncovering existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat sars-cov-2 infection. table 2 lists potential targets, their roles in viral infection, and representative existing drugs or drug candidates that reportedly act on the corresponding targets in similar viruses and thus are to be assessed for their effects on sars-cov-2 infection. 3clpro and plpro are two viral proteases responsible for the cleavage of viral peptides into functional units for virus replication and packaging within the host cells. thus, drugs that target these proteases in other viruses such as hiv drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, have been explored. 19 rdrp is the rna polymerase responsible for viral rna synthesis that may be blocked by existing antiviral drugs or drug candidates, such as remdesivir. 19 conceivably, the interaction of viral s protein with its receptor ace2 on host cells, and subsequent viral endocytosis into the cells, may also be a viable drug target. for example, the broadspectrum antiviral drug arbidol, which functions as a virus-host cell fusion inhibitor to prevent viral entry into host cells against influenza virus, 20 has entered into a clinical trial for treatment of sars-cov-2. 21, 22 the protease tmprss2 produced by the host cells plays an important role in proteolytic processing of s protein priming to the receptor ace2 binding in human cells. 11 it has been shown that camostat mesylate, a clinically approved tmprss2 inhibitor, was able to block sars-cov-2 entry to human cells, indicating its potential as a drug for covid-19. 11 ace2 involvement with coronavirus infection is of further interest since ace2 is a potent negative regulator restraining overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (ras) that may be involved in elicitation of inflammatory lung disease in addition to its well-known role in regulation of blood pressure and balance of body fluid and electrolytes. 23, 24 it catalyzes degradation of angiotensin ii to angiotensin (1−7). the balance between angiotensin ii and angiotensin (1−7) is critical since angiotensin ii binds to angiotensin at1 receptor to cause vasoconstriction, whereas angiotensin (1−7) elicits vasodilation mediated by at2. 25−27 although the notion that ace2 mediates coronavirus invasion is largely accepted, it remains unclear how the levels or activities of ace2, at1 receptors, and at2 receptors are altered in coronavirus-induced diseases due to the limited number of studies. 23, 24 therefore, it is yet to be determined whether some drugs or compounds that target any of these proteins (e.g., l-163491 as a partial antagonist of at1 receptor and partial agonist of at2 receptor) may alleviate coronavirusinduced lung injury. 28 patents and potential drug candidates related to key protein targets. the cas content collection contains patents related to coronavirus key proteins listed above. table 3 lists the number of patents related to each protein target and associated therapeutic compounds with a cas registry number (cas rn) reported in these patents. cas data show that targets 3clpro and rdrp attracted more attention than other targets, and more compounds with therapeutic potential were identified for these targets, probably due to the work done for sars-cov which also contains 3clpro and rdrp.existing drugs with potential therapeutic applications for covid-19. since sars-cov-2 is a newly discovered pathogen, no specific drugs have been identified or are currently available. an economic and efficient therapeutic strategy is to repurpose existing drugs. on the basis of genomic sequence information coupled with protein structure modeling, the scientific community has been able to rapidly respond with a suggested list of existing drugs with therapeutic potential for covid-19. table 4 provides a summary of such drugs together with potential mechanisms of actions for their activities. barcitinib was proposed because of its anti-inflammatory effect and possible ability to reduce viral entry. 35 a fixed dose of the anti-hiv combination, lopinavir−ritonavir, is currently in clinical trials with arbidol or ribavirin. 22 remdesivir, developed by gilead sciences inc., was previously tested in humans with ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for mers and sars. the drug is currently being studied in phase iii clinical trials in both china and the usa. favipiravir, a over 500 journal articles were published in the first two months of 2020, and the number of published articles has increased each week since the week of january 13, 2020. purine nucleoside leading to inaccurate viral rna synthesis, 36 was originally developed by toyama chemical of japan, and has recently been approved for a clinical trial as a drug to treat covid-19. 30 chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, has proven effective in treating coronavirus in china. 32 in addition to the above-mentioned, many other antiviral drugs are also listed. selected patents related to promising small molecule drug candidates. table 5 shows selected patents associated with the aforementioned potential drugs, together with patents disclosing small molecules for treatment of sars or mers.the selection was based on the presence of important terms in cas-indexed patents as well as the presence of the synthetic preparation role assigned by cas scientists during document indexing. patent applications wo2009114512 and wo2014028756 disclose preparation of compounds active as jak inhibitors, one of which was later named as baricitinib and developed for reducing inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. patent application jp5971830 discloses preparation of polycyclic pyridone compounds and their use as endonuclease inhibitors. patent applications us20160122374 and us20170071964 patent application wo2013049382 discloses both structures and syntheses of compounds from various structure classes (peptidyl aldehydes, peptidyl α-ketoamides, peptidyl bisulfite salts, and peptidyl heterocycles), as well as certain formulation compositions, developed to inhibit viral 3c protease or 3c-like protease (i.e., 3clpro).patent application wo2018042343 presents both preparation methods and biological assay results for compounds capable of inhibiting the sars virus proteases. these compounds appeared to exhibit good enzyme-inhibiting activity (pic 50 ≈ 7 ritonavir is a pharmacokinetic profile enhancer that may potentiate the effects of other protease inhibitors due to its ability to attenuate the degradation of those drugs by the liver enzyme cyp3a4 and thus is used in combination with antivirial lopinavir. 37 d an inhibitor of viral entry to host cells. its direct action on s protein and ace2 is yet to be confirmed. (table 6 ). these drug candidates mostly inhibit viral enzymes including proteases and components for rdrp. since 3clpro protease has a high level of sequence homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2, inhibitors against 3clpro of sars-cov may also be applicable to sars-cov-2. compounds, including benzopurpurin b, c-467929, c-473872, nsc-306711 and n-65828, which may inhibit the activity of viral nsp15, poly(u)-specific endoribonuclease, were tested for reduced sars-cov infectivity in cultured cells with ic 50 of 0.2−40 μm. 38 compound c-21 and cgp-42112a are two at2 agonists, whereas l-163491 has dual functions as a partial agonist for at2 receptor and a partial antagonist of at1 receptor. since at1 and at2 are important effectors in the ras system to which ace2 belongs, it has been speculated that these compounds may be used to adjust the balance between at1 and at2, which may be affected by coronavirus infection and to alleviate viral-induced lung injury during the infection. 24 small molecules identified by structure similarity, lipinski's rule of 5, and cas-indexed pharmacological activity and/or therapeutic usage. besides the aforementioned antiviral drugs, there may be additional small molecule compounds with therapeutic or pharmacological potential against viruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov. compounds listed in tables 4 and 6 were subjected to a tanimoto similarity search in cas registry using cas proprietary fingerprints. a those substances with at least 60% structural similarity match and meeting lipinski's rule of 5 were identified. table 7 lists selected compounds that were also identified to have a pharmacological activity or therapeutic usage role. compound name and cas rn are provided for each compound. the second column lists the number of compounds that met the structure similarity and lipinski's rule criteria. although more work remains to be done in this regard, the methodology and results mentioned here point to a strategy that may help streamline the process of drug discovery for covid-19.■ biologics for coronavirus-associated diseases distribution of biologics patents related to sars and mers. the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 related to sars and mers viruses is causing serious and ongoing epidemiological problems around the world. since there is limited clinical and basic research information at this time, treatment options for covid-19 currently comprise investigational drugs and management of symptoms. as biologics have the potential to broaden the spectrum of the treatment options for coronavirusinduced diseases, leveraging prior knowledge and practices used to address the sars and mers outbreaks provides a practical strategy for developing new target-specific therapeutic agents for sars-cov-2. to this end, an analysis of biologics from patents contained in the cas content collection was performed. the patent analysis included information related to therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, interfering and other therapeutic rnas, and vaccines for potential treatment and/or prevention of sars-related diseases from patents published from 2003 to the present. figure 6 shows more than 500 patents that disclose the use of these four biologics classes to treat and prevent sars and mers. of these patents, vaccine development was the largest class (363), followed by therapeutic antibodies (99), interfering rnas (35) , and cytokines (22) . given the indispensable role of vaccines in viral disease prevention, detailed analysis of vaccines will be presented in a later section.antibodies. ninety-nine patents containing information about antibodies with therapeutic and/or diagnostic potential for sars and mers were identified. of these, 61 patents claimed preparation of sars-specific antibodies (23), mersspecific antibodies (17) , or antibodies with diagnostic application (21). similar to sars-cov, the receptor-binding domain (rbd) in the s protein of sars-cov-2 binds to human ace2 receptor in order to gain access into host cells. 42 in viral infection, the s protein, but not the other structural proteins, m, e, and n in sars-cov, elicits an immune response. 43 table 8 shows the target analysis of patents related to development of therapeutic antibodies for sars. over 90% of these antibodies are directed against s protein including its rbd. the data indicate that the s protein is a putative target for sars-cov-2 antibody development.an additional 38 patents contained information pertaining to other types of antiviral antibodies that were useful for sars and mers therapies. these included neutralizing antibodies or antibodies designed to target proteins such as il-6/il-6r, tlr3 (toll-like receptor 3), cd16, itam (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), dc-sign (dendritic cellspecific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin), icam-3 (intercellular adhesion molecule 3), or ip-10/ cxcl10 (interferon γ-inducible protein 10). cytokine storm has been reported to correlate with disease severity in sars-cov-2 infection. patients admitted to an icu had higher concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, particularly g-csf, ip-10/cxcl10, mcp1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), and tnfα, as well as elevated cytokines from t helper 2 cells such as il-4 and il-10. 44 patent application besides various commercialized antiviral drugs, there are also small molecule compounds currently in r&d that have shown significant inhibitory effects on many key proteins from other viruses. more than 500 patents that disclose the use of four biologics classes such as therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, rna therapies, and vaccines to treat and prevent sars and mers have been analyzed for this study. wo2005058815 discloses human anti-ip-10 antibodies, including bispecific molecules and immunoconjugates that bind to ip-10 with high affinity, for treating inflammation, autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative disease, bacterial infection, and viral infection. patent application wo2017095875 discloses the preparation of human antibodies and immunoconjugates specifically targeting chemokine ip-10, including an anti-ip-10 antibody shown to suppress free serum ip-10 in about 3 days at 0.5 mg/kg and in approximately 10 days at 10 mg/kg in cynomolgus macaques. in addition, dc-sign/cd209, a type ii transmembrane adhesion molecule with c-type lectin function, is mainly expressed on interstitial dendritic cells and lung alveolar macrophages. 45 dc-sign functions as an entry cofactor in transferring sars-cov to susceptible cells such as pneumocytes. 46 patent application wo200505824 claims the production of a humanized anti-dc-sign antibody that interfered with the interaction of dc-sign with its receptor, icam-3. the antibody effectively blocked viral binding, infection, and transmission for viral infections/diseases, including sars.cytokines. cytokines are low-molecular-weight proteins that act as chemical signals in the immune response to pathogen invasion. the production of various cytokines in response to an invading pathogen such as a virus contributes to the host organism's ability to eliminate the pathogen. specific types of cytokines, including chemokines, interferons (ifns), interleukins, and lymphokines, have been reported and characterized in the literature over the past 40 years. by early 2020, the cas lexicon contained over 700 terms for specific types of cytokines associated with 76 724 documents, including 11 837 patents.during a viral infection, the most prominent cytokines produced are ifns, which interfere with viral replication. ifns are classified as type i (ifn-α, ifn-β, ifn-δ, ifn-ε, ifn-κ, ifn-ν, ifn-τ, and ifn-ω), type ii (ifn-γ), or type iii (ifn-λ) based on the receptor complex used for signaling as well as sequence homology. 47 because of their ability to interfere with viral replication, interferons and interferon fusion proteins have been utilized as therapeutic agents for treatment of viral infections for the past 20 years. a few patents disclosing these proteins and their use for treating sars are described below.rsifn-co. patent applications wo2011072487 and wo2016180335 describe the cloning of a recombinant interferon (rsifn-co, cas rn 2043378-94-3) as well as a method for determining its potency that was effective for treating various viral infections/diseases, including sars. the invention relates that rsifn-co has an identical amino acid sequence to infergen (118390-30-0), but it has an altered spatial conformation and different biological potency. the rsifn-co not only has an antiviral activity that is 20 times stronger than the clinically available interferon, but also has significantly stronger antitumor properties against breast cancer and cervical cancer than other recombinant human α-interferons. the invention further relates that rsifn has reduced toxic and side effects and can be safely used in large doses (each dose can be >10 million iu), making it possible to successfully treat some viral diseases or tumors that require large doses of interferon. ifn-ω. patent application wo2004096852 discloses the amino acid sequence for recombinant human interferon ω (rhifn-ω) (rn 791910-34-4) that was shown to have an anti-sars viral activity similar to that of ifn-β. ifn-ω effectively decreased disease severity and inhibited proliferation of coronavirus strain bj01 in monkeys.il-28a (ifn-λ2), il-28b (ifn-λ3) , and il-29 (ifn-λ1) variants. patent application wo2005097165 claims a method for treating sars viral infection using il-28a, il-28b, and il-29 cysteine variants conjugated to polymers (e.g., polyethylene glycol) and discloses the amino acid and nucleic acid sequences for these cysteine variants. of these variants, metil-29c172s-peg (rn 867228-40-8) was specifically shown to inhibit viral replication.interferon-human serum albumin fusion protein. patents applications us20090053173 and cn101942026 both disclose long-lasting fusion proteins (hsa-ifn) with each of them being composed of an interferon fused with human serum albumin-binding peptide for treatment of a wide range of diseases, including sars. specific hsa-ifn fusion proteins were constructed using five different interferons (ifn-α1b, ifn-α2b, ifn-β, ifn-ω, ifn-γ) with corresponding cas rns 1122730-20-4, 1122730-23-7, 1122730-25-9, 1122730-27-1, and 1122730-29-3, respectively. these hsa-ifn fusion proteins significantly lengthened the plasma half-life of interferons (e.g., from 10 h to 12 days for hsa-ifn-α2b) due to slower free interferon release into the plasma and thus may prolong the effects of interferon for each injection.rna therapies. rna interference (rnai) is a biological process wherein small complementary rna duplexes target and neutralize specific mrna molecules, resulting in inhibition of gene expression or genetic translation. interfering rnas include micrornas and small interfering rnas (sirnas) that are generally about 21−25 nucleotides in length. short hairpin rnas (shrnas) are artificial synthetic rna molecules designed to fold into a tight hairpin conformation that allows them to silence their target genes, and can serve as precursors of sirnas. the expression of shrnas in cells is typically accomplished by their delivery via plasmids or viral or bacterial vectors. 48 although micrornas are noncoding and naturally found in plants, animals, and some viruses, synthetic versions are currently being used to silence a variety of genes. 49 the ability to chemically synthesize modified analogues of micrornas as well as sirnas, which are capable of altering disease-related gene expression or inhibiting pathogen gene expression, has created a host of new therapeutic options. 50 in contrast to the micrornas and sirnas, antisense rnas are single-stranded rnas which are naturally occurring or synthetic and usually around 19−23 nucleotides in length with a sequence complementary to that of a protein coding mrna, allowing it to hybridize and block protein translation. 48 since the discovery of rnai in the late 1990s, it has become a well-known method for silencing/suppressing target genes associated with virulence and pathogenesis. thirty-five patents in the cas content collection disclose the use of rnai in treating sars, with 28 patents using sirna molecules, three patents using antisense oligonucleotides, two patents using rna aptamers, one patent using a ribozyme, and one patent using a microrna inhibitor. supporting information table s1 provides a high-level view of these 35 patents including the specific rnai targets. a few of these patents are further discussed below.sirnas targeting coronavirus proteins m, n, or e. patent application cn101173275 discloses two double-stranded rnas (dsrnas) designed to specifically target two separate regions of the sars protein m mrna. the sirna-m1 sequences targeting the 220−241 region of protein m mrna correspond to cas rns 1023405-01-7 and 1023405-02-8, while sirna-m2 sequences targeting the 460−480 region correspond to cas rns 1023405-03-9 and 1023405-04-0. the interference efficiency of these two sirnas on sars m protein gene expression was greater than 70%.patent application cn1648249 discloses sequences associated with sirnas specifically designed to target the m, n, and e genes of sars. three of these sirnas (nos. 15, 58, and 90) were shown to inhibit expression of gfp-m, gfp-n, and gfp-e fusion proteins, respectively. an additional three sirnas (nos. 8*, 51*, and 56*) were prepared which contained a mutation at the 3′ end (bold letter) of the sense strand. these modified sirnas (shown below) demonstrated increased inhibition of sars virus gene expression compared to the original sirnas.sirnas targeting replicase and rna polymerase region. patent application us20050004063 discloses six sirnas (sarsi-1 to sarsi-6) targeting the replicase 1a region of sars that were shown to inhibit virus infection and replication, with sarsi-4 being the most efficient. the sense strand sequences and corresponding cas rns are shown in the table below. this invention also disclosed sarsi-7 to sarsi-11, which target the s, e, n, and m genes.the authors demonstrated that sarsi-2, sarsi-3, sarsi-4, and sarsi-7-11 inhibited coronavirus infection and replication in frhk-4 cells. sarsi-4 was the most effective with nearly complete inhibition, followed by sarsi-2 and sarsi-3.patent application cn1569233 discloses sirnas, shown in table 11 , that target sars genes encoding rna-dependent rna polymerase, helicase, nucleoprotein n, and proteolytic enzymes. these sirnas were able to inhibit or kill 50−90% of the sars virus bj01 strain, with the proteolytic enzyme-targeting sirnas being the most effective.rna aptamers. two korean patents describe the use of rna aptamers for inhibition of sars viruses. patent application kr2009128837 identifies rna aptamers as anti-sars agents capable of binding to and inhibiting the double-stranded dna unwinding of the sars virus helicase. related patent application kr 2012139512 describes rna aptamers with distinct affinity for the nucleocapsid of sars-cov for potential pharmaceutical use. ribozymes. patent application jp2007043942 describes a therapeutic rna/dna chimeric ribozyme designed to recognize and cleave conserved common regions and regions with loop structures in the genes of coronaviruses, including sars. this ribozyme specifically recognizes the guc in viral genes with loop conformations.antisense oligonucleotides. antisense oligonucleotides have also been developed to reduce the severity of sars virus infections and to prevent or treat sars virus-associated disease, to detect the virus in human samples, and to diagnose sars virus-associated diseases. patent application wo2005023083 published by ionis pharmaceuticals describes hybrid dna/ rna antisense oligonucleotides designed to disrupt the pseudoknot in the frameshift site of the sars coronavirus rna. in addition to directly targeting the virus, antisense oligonucleotides may be used to target disease-related proteins involved in the inflammatory process.it is crucial to develop safe and effective vaccines to control the covid-19 pandemic, eliminate its spread, and ultimately prevent its future recurrence. since the sars-cov-2 virus shares significant sequence homology with two other lethal coronaviruses, sars and mers, the vaccines identified in these patents related to sars and mers viruses could potentially facilitate the design of anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines.distribution of patents related to sars and mers among vaccine types. antiviral vaccines generally fall into one of the following types: inactive or live-attenuated viruses, virus-like particle (vlp), viral vectors, protein-based, dnabased, and mrna-based vaccines. there are 363 patents in the cas content collection related to vaccine development to prevent viral disorders/diseases, including sars and mers. of these, 175 patents disclose vaccines for non-coronaviruses that may have relevance to sars and mers, while 188 patents are directly associated with anti-sars and anti-mers vaccines with a demonstrated immune response. supporting information table s2 contains additional information on these sars/ mers vaccine-related patents. figure 7 reveals the distribution of patents among these vaccine types related to sars and mers. as can be seen, 15 patents disclose information about inactive and live-attenuated virus vaccines, 28 patents describe dna vaccines, 21 patents disclose information on viral vector vaccines, 13 patents disclose information on vlp vaccines, and three patents are focused on mrna vaccines.it was reported that viral s protein subunit vaccines produced higher neutralizing antibody titers and more complete protection than live-attenuated sars-cov, full-length s protein, and dna-based s protein vaccines. 51 unsurprisingly, about half of the patents focused on protein vaccines comprising the s protein subunit vaccine and vaccines specifically targeting the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the s1 subunit of the viral s protein. collectively, s protein/gene is the preferred target a total of 188 patents are directly associated with anti-sars and anti-mers vaccines with a demonstrated immune response. supporting information table s2 contains additional information on these sars/mers vaccinerelated patents. dna-based vaccines. patent application wo2005081716 discloses compositions and methods for inducing/enhancing immune responses, particularly antigen-specific cd8+ t cellmediated responses, against antigens of the sars coronavirus. an enhancement of the immune response involving particularly cytotoxic t cell immune responses is induced in vivo by chimeric nucleic acids that encode an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone polypeptide (e.g., calreticulin) linked to at least one antigenic polypeptide or peptide from sars-cov. using gene gun delivery of dna-coated gold particles, vaccination of mice against a calreticulin−nucleocapsid fusion protein resulted in potent nucleocapsid-specific humoral and t cell-mediated immune responses. vaccinated animals were capable of significantly reducing the titer of a challenging vaccinia vector expressing the n protein of the sars virus.patent application wo2015081155 discloses immunogens, which comprise consensus proteins derived from the mers-cov spike protein, for use in dna-based vaccines targeting mers-cov. the consensus spike protein significantly induced both humoral and cellular immune responses, including increased titers of igg and neutralizing antibodies. the induced cellular immune response involved increased cd3+cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ t cell responses that produced ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-2, or both ifn-γ and tnf-α. on march 3, 2020, inovio pharmaceutical, inc. announced they had designed the dna vaccine called ino-4800 to be planned for human trials in the united states in april. 57 protein-based vaccines. patent application wo2010063685 by glaxosmithkline (gsk) discloses a vaccine capable of provoking a protective immune response against sars. the vaccine comprises an s protein immunogen and an oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant. an engineered ectodomain immunogen (soluble s protein), in combination with the emulsion adjuvant, gsk2, induced high levels of anti-sars-cov igg2a or igg2b antibody responses and neutralizing antibody responses in animal models. in late february 2020, gsk announced a collaboration with chinese firm clover biopharmaceuticals to assess a coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine candidate. 52 this collaboration will involve the use of clover's protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidate (covid-19 s-trimer) with gsk's adjuvant system. by applying their trimer-tag technology, clover has manufactured an s-trimer subunit vaccine using a rapid mammalian cell culture-based expression system. the trimer-tag is an advanced drug development platform, which enables the production of novel, covalently trimerized fusion proteins that can better target previous undruggable pathways.patent application us20070003577 discloses immunogenic compositions and vaccines associated with the s protein of sars coronavirus. a trispike sars coronavirus vaccine was prepared from a recombinant full-length trimeric s protein.the recombinant protein was shown to (1) exhibit native antigenicity as shown by reactivity with convalescent sars patient sera; (2) exhibit specific binding to soluble ace2 receptor; (3) promote antibody-dependent viral entry in otherwise refractory human raji b cells; and (4) elicit protection against a challenge infection in an animal model. patent application us20060002947 (antigen express, inc., a subsidiary of generex) discloses the preparation of hybrid peptides composed of three elements, including (a) an invariant chain (ii) key peptide for antigen presentation enhancing activity, (b) a chemical structure linking the ii to the antigenic epitope, and (c) an antigenic epitope that binds to a mhc class ii molecule. the methodology was used to create ii-key/ mhc ii sars hybrids. recently, generex announced that it is developing a covid-19 vaccine following a contractual agreement with a chinese consortium comprised of china technology exchange, beijing zhonghua investment fund management, biology institute of shandong academy of sciences, and sinotek-advocates international industry development. the company will utilize its ii-key immune system activation technology to produce a covid-19 viral peptide for human clinical trials. 53 virus-like particle vaccines. in 2015, patent application wo2015042373 by novavax disclosed an immunogenic composition composed of mers-cov nanoparticle vlps containing at least one trimer of a s protein, produced by baculovirus overexpression in sf9 cells. this vlp preparation induced a neutralizing antibody response in mice and transgenic cattle, when administered along with their proprietary adjuvant matrix m (rn 1235341-17-9 ). in addition, preparations of sera from vaccinated cattle (sab-300 or sab-301) were injected into ad5-hdpp4 transduced balb/c mice prior to challenge with mers-cov. both sab-300 and sab-301 were able to protect these mice from mers-cov infection with a single prophylactic injection. novavax announced on february 26, 2020 54 that it was beginning animal testing on potential covid-19 vaccine candidates due to their previous experiences working with other coronaviruses, including both mers and sars. their covid-19 candidate vaccines targeting the s protein of sars-cov-2 were developed using their recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology along with their proprietary adjuvant matrix-m.mrna-based vaccines. the potential advantages of an mrna approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to mimic natural infection to stimulate a more potent immune response as well as the ability to combine multiple mrnas into a single vaccine. patent application wo2017070626 by moderna discloses mrna vaccines composed of mrnas encoding antigenic viral full-length s, s1, or s2 proteins from sars-cov and mers-cov virus, formulated in cationic lipid nanoparticles. they show that mice vaccinated with mrna encoding coronavirus full-length s protein generated much higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to mrna encoding the s protein s2 subunit. new zealand white rabbits immunized with mers-cov mrna vaccine encoding the fulllength s protein reduced more than 90% of the viral load in the lungs of the rabbits and induced a significant amount of neutralizing antibody against mers-cov. moderna announced on february 24, 2020 55 that it has released the first batch of mrna-1273 against sars-cov-2 for use in humans, prepared using methods and strategies outlined in their previous patents. vials of mrna-1273 have been shipped to the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), a division of the national institutes of health (nih), to be used in the planned phase 1 study in the united states. moderna reports that mrna-1273 is an mrna vaccine targeting a prefusionstabilized form of the s protein associated with sars-cov-2, which was selected by moderna in collaboration with investigators at the niaid vaccine research center. manufacture of this batch was funded by the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations.patent application wo2018115527 describes vaccines comprising mrna encoding at least one antigen of a mers coronavirus, preferably a s protein or a s protein fragment (s1), an envelope protein (e), a membrane protein (m), or a nucleocapsid protein (n), all of which were effective in inducing an antigen-specific immune response. intradermal administration into mice of a lipid nanoparticle (lnp)-encapsulated mrna mixture encoding mers-cov s proteins was shown to result in translation in vivo and induction of humoral immune responses.this report provides an overview of published information on global research and development of coronavirus-related therapeutic agents and preventive vaccines based on the extensive cas content collection, with a focus on patents. it includes an overview of coronavirus morphology, biology, and pathogenesis with a particular focus on antiviral strategies involving small molecule drugs, as well as biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication. the drug-repurposing effort summarized in this report is focused primarily on agents currently known to be effective against other rna viruses including sars-cov, mers-cov, influenza, hcv, and ebola as well as antiinflammatory drugs. the potential impact of biologics for treatment of coronavirus infections is promising and includes a wide variety of options including bioengineered and vectored antibodies, cytokines, and nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression as well as various types of vaccines.the information provided in this report provides a strong intellectual groundwork for support of ongoing research and development for discovery and development of therapeutic agents and vaccines for treatment of covid-19 and coronavirus-related diseases. because of limited space, this report devotes minimal attention to current efforts involved in advancing more efficient and accurate covid-19 diagnosis methods and products.novel infectious diseases resulting from rna viruses subject to mutation and genetic recombination, as well as cross-species transmission, will continue to present a serious global health threat, as exemplified by covid-19. despite two former major outbreaks of coronavirus infections causing the sars and mers respiratory illnesses, the world remains underprepared to effectively manage the current covid-19 outbreak, as evidenced by the fact that covid-19 has resulted in thousands of deaths worldwide.a concerted effort to develop effective drugs and vaccines against existing and potential future coronavirus infections and other highly pathogenic virus outbreaks is necessary to reduce overwhelming impacts on human life and worldwide healthcare systems. given the costly and arduous process involved with clinical drug development, the outbreak of covid-19 further highlights the value of developing relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and the importance of applying innovative approaches such as artificial intelligence to facilitate drug discovery. given the lengthy process of new drug development, the current strategy of drug repurposing has become one of the chosen solutions for immediate treatment of sars-cov-2 infected individuals. long-term drug development goals for the pharmaceutical industry include identification of inhibitors aimed at the replication or infection processes associated with sars-cov-2 or other related coronaviruses, as well as the symptomatic results of their infections leading to severe disease and/or death. the summarized lists, contained in this report, of small molecule compounds, and additional descriptions of biologics with properties suitable for inhibiting several key coronavirus proteins, could serve as information starting points for drug development. since vaccines are crucial for prevention of coronavirus-related epidemic diseases in the future, it is reassuring that a number of innovative strategies are already being deployed. four mers coronavirus dna vaccine candidates began phase 1 clinical trials in september of 2019, 56 and moderna inc. released its first batch of mrna-1273 in february of 2020, which is an mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 ready for phase 1 study in the united states. 55 additional collaboration in the areas of antiviral discovery processes and clinical trial performance will enhance patients' access to drug candidates with improved therapeutic potential and ideally reduce the amount of time required to bring these drugs to market. the abundance of publications and the rapid publication rate associated with the sars-cov-2 virus-related disease outbreak, as illustrated in this report, are indicative of the intense effort by research institutes and pharmaceutical industries to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes useful for treating current and future coronavirus outbreaks.the

and distribution of vaccine patents related to sars and mers in the cas content collection (pdf)in december 2019, public health officials in wuhan, china, reported the first case of severe 60 respiratory disease attributed to infection with the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 (1). since its 61 emergence, sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly via human-to-human transmission (2), threatening to 62 overwhelm healthcare systems around the world and resulting in the declaration of a pandemic by the 63 world health organization (3). the disease caused by the virus is characterized by fever, 64 pneumonia, and other respiratory and inflammatory symptoms that can result in severe inflammation of 65 lung tissue and ultimately death-particularly among older adults or individuals with underlying 66 comorbidities (4-6). as of this writing, the sars-cov-2 pandemic has resulted in 4 million confirmed 67 cases of covid-19 and over 280,000 deaths worldwide (7). 68 sars-cov-2 is the third pathogenic coronavirus to cross the species barrier into humans in the 69 past two decades, preceded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) (8, 9) and 70middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) (10). all three of these viruses belong to the 71 β -coronavirus genus and have either been confirmed (sars-cov) or suggested (mers-cov, sars-72cov-2) to originate in bats, with transmission to humans occurring through intermediary animal hosts 73 (11) (12) (13) (14) . while previous zoonotic spillovers of coronaviruses have been marked by high case fatality rates 74 (~10% for sars-cov; ~34% for mers-cov), widespread transmission of disease has been relatively 75 limited (8,098 cases of sars; 2,494 cases of mers) (15). in contrast, sars-cov-2 is estimated to have 76 a lower case fatality rate (~2-4%) but is far more infectious and has achieved world-wide spread in a 77 matter of months (16). 78as the number of covid-19 cases continues to grow, there is an urgent need for a safe and 79 effective vaccine to combat the spread of sars-cov-2 and reduce the burden on hospitals and healthcare 80 systems. no licensed vaccine or therapeutic is currently available for sars-cov-2, although there are 81 over 100 vaccine candidates reportedly in development worldwide. seven vaccine candidates have 82 peptide was removed from the structure using chimera 1.14 (university of california-san francisco) (50) 158 prior to running simulations. ten models of each peptide-hla complex were generated on the basis of 159 minimized energy scores, and the top model for each complex was selected for comparative analysis. 160prediction and structural modeling of sars-cov-2 b cell epitopes 161 linear b cell epitope predictions were performed on the three exposed sars-cov-2 structural 162 proteins: s (genbank accession: qhd43416), m (qhd43419), and e (qhd43418) using the bepipred 163 1.0 algorithm (51). epitope probability scores were calculated for each amino acid residue using a 164 threshold of 0.35 (corresponding to > 0.75 specificity and sensitivity below 0.5), and only epitopes > 5 165 amino acid residues in length were further analyzed. the structure of the sars-cov-2 s protein was 166 accessed from the protein data bank (pdb id: 6vsb) (52). discontinuous (i.e., structural) b cell epitope 167 predictions for the s protein structure were carried out using discotope 1.1 (53) with a score threshold 168 greater than -7.7 (corresponding to > 0.75 specificity and sensitivity below 0.5). the main protein 169 structure was modeled in pymol (schrödinger, llc), with predicted b cell epitopes identified by both 170 bepipred 1.0 and discotope 1.1 highlighted as spheres. 171genetic similarity of sars-cov-2 isolates 173the primary goal of our study was to identify peptide epitopes that would be broadly applicable 174 in vaccine development efforts against sars-cov-2. we identified 64 point mutations and 4 deletions 175 across the genomes of 44 clinical isolates, with all deletions and the majority of mutations (n=45) 176 occurring in the orf1ab polyprotein (supp. figure s1 ). single-point mutations were also found in the s 177 protein (n=5), n protein (n=5), orf8 protein (n=3), orf3a protein (n=2), orf10 protein (n=2), e 178 protein (n=1), and m protein (n=1). despite the genetic diversity introduced by these events (figure 1d) , 179 matrix analysis determined that > 99% sequence identity was maintained across all viral genomes. based 180 on these findings and for study feasibility, the genome from the original virus isolate 181 genbank: mn908947) was selected as the consensus sequence for all further analyses. 182we next identified potential cd8 + t cell epitopes from all proteins in the sars-cov-2 184 proteome. using the netctl 1.2 predictive algorithm, we analyzed the complete amino acid sequence of 185 each viral protein to generate sets of 9-mer peptides predicted to be recognized across at least one of the 186 major hla class i supertypes (figure 2a, supp. figure s2) . this approach yielded a significant number 187 of potential epitopes from each viral protein (orf10: 9, orf6: 17, orf8: 23, e: 25, orf7: 39, n: 80, 188 m: 87, orf3a: 87, s: 321, orf1ab: 2814) , with the number directly related to the size of the parent protein. we used the netmhcpan 4.0 server to further refine the list of potential cd8 + t cell epitopes by 190 predicting binding affinity across representative hla class i alleles (see methods) and assigning 191 percentile scores to quantify binding propensity. peptides with percentile rank scores < 0.5% (i.e., strong 192 binders) were filtered using a 500 nm threshold for binding affinity to further delineate 740 candidate 193 hla class i epitopes from the viral proteome (54). for feasibility reasons, we refined our selection to 83 194 candidate epitopes by excluding peptides predicted to bind only one hla molecule (supp . table s1 ). 195the resultant peptides were enriched for predicted binders to hla-b molecules 196 hla-b*58:01=32; hla-b*08:01=31) ( figure 2b) . a final round of selection on the basis of hla 197 promiscuity (i.e., predicted binding to > 3 hla molecules) and predicted antigenicity scoring using the 198 vaxijen 2.0 server produced a subset of five candidate peptides (four orf1ab, one s protein) as potential 199 targets for vaccine development (table 1) with the hypothesis that increased hla binding promiscuity 200 meant broader population base coverage by those peptides. these peptides were predicted to provide 74% 201 global population coverage and had higher predicted binding affinities for hla-b molecules 202 (b*08:01=42.6 nm; b*15:01=67.7 nm; b*58:01=110.3 nm) compared to hla-a molecules 203 (a*01:01=238.6 nm; a*24:02=142.9 nm), with the exception of one orf1ab-derived peptide 204 (mmisagfsl) that was predicted to bind hla-a*02:01 with high affinity (ic 50 = 6.9 nm) ( figure 2c) . 205we also sought to identify potential hla class ii peptides from sars-cov-2, as the stimulation 207 of cd4 + t-helper cells is critical for robust vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses. using the 208 netmhciipan 3.2 server, we identified 801 candidate hla class ii peptides from the viral proteome 209 predicted to have high binding affinity (< 500 nm) and percentile rank scores < 2% across a reference 210 panel of hla molecules covering > 97% of the population (33, 45). similar to hla class i epitope 211predictions, the number of class ii epitopes identified for each viral protein (orf10: 4, e protein: 7, 212 orf7: 8, orf8: 10, orf6: 14, n: 15, m: 29, orf3a: 31, s: 96, orf1ab: 587) was largely proportional 213 to protein size. after excluding peptides predicted to bind to only a single hla molecule in our panel, we 214 refined our selection to 211 peptides (supp . table s2 ), which were enriched for binding to hla-drb1 215 molecules (n=142) ( figure 2d ). filtering on hla promiscuity and predicted antigenicity scores yielded 216 a subset of 36 peptides (24 orf1ab, 5 s protein, 2 m protein, 2 orf7, 1 orf3a, 1 orf6, 1 orf8) as 217 cd4 + t cell epitopes for further study ( table 1) . these peptides were predicted to collectively provide 218 99% population coverage and have significantly higher average binding affinities for hla-dr alleles 219 (drb1=56.4 nm; drb3=50.9 nm; drb4=70.1 nm; drb5=18 nm) compared to hla-dp (155.9 nm) 220 or hla-dq (238.6 nm) molecules ( figure 2e) . 221characterization of hla class i peptide docking with hla-b*15:01the five candidate hla class i peptides identified by our computational approach were predicted 223 to provide coverage across six hla alleles (a*01:01, a*02:01, a*24:02, b*08:01, b*15:01, b*58:01). 224the peptide famqmayrf was the only candidate predicted to bind to a*24:02 molecules, whereas 225 mmisagfsl was predicted to uniquely bind a*02:01 and b*08:01 molecules. four of the five peptides 226 were predicted to bind a*01:01 and b*58:01 molecules, but all were predicted to bind with relatively 227 high affinity (average ic 50 = 67.7 nm) to hla-b*15:01. therefore, we performed molecular docking 228 studies of each peptide with the molecular structure of hla-b*15:01 (pdb: 3c9n). 229all peptides were predicted to bind within the peptide binding groove, forming hydrogen bond 230 contacts with numerous amino acid side chains ( figure 3a) . the binding motif for hla-b*15:01 is 231 highly selective for residues at the p2 and p9 anchor positions, with a preference for bulky hydrophobic 232 amino acids at the c-terminus ( figure 3b ) (55). all candidate peptides possessed terminal residues (phe, 233tyr, leu) that fit into the hydrophobic binding pocket of the hla groove, further supporting that these 234 peptides should be strong binders of hla-b*15:01 and promising candidates for vaccine development 235 studies. 236an effective vaccine should stimulate both cellular and humoral immune responses against the 238 target pathogen; therefore, we also sought to identify potential b cell epitopes from sars-cov-2 239 proteins. we limited our analysis to the primary structural proteins exposed on the virus capsid (s, n, m, 240 and e), as these are the most accessible antigens for engaging b cell receptors. using the bepipred 1.0 241 algorithm, we identified 26 potential linear b cell epitopes in the s protein, 14 potential epitopes in the n 242 protein, and 3 potential epitopes in the m protein ( table 2) . no epitopes were identified in the e protein. 243studies have previously shown the s protein to be the predominant target of neutralizing antibodies 244 against coronaviruses (56, 57), and, as our findings indicate this to likely be the case for sars-cov-2, 245 we focused all subsequent analyses on the s protein. while the n protein is also a major target of the 246 antibody response (58), it is unlikely these antibodies have any neutralizing activity based on the viral 247 structure. as epitope conformation can significantly influence recognition by antibodies, we also 248 employed discotope 1.1 to identify discontinuous b cell epitopes in the protein structure. our analysis 249 identified 14 potential structural epitopes in the s protein (7 in the s1 domain, 7 in the s2 domain), with 250 six regions having significant overlap with our predicted linear epitopes ( table 2) . antigenic regions 251 identified in both analyses were modeled using the recently published structure of the sars-cov-2 s 252 protein (52) to examine their accessibility for antibody binding. epitopes in the s2 domain (p792-d796; 253 y1138-d1146) were clustered near the base of the spike protein, whereas regions in the s1 domain 254 (d405-d428; n440-n450; g496-p507; d568-t573) were exposed on the protein surface (figure 4 ).in the face of the covid-19 pandemic, it is imperative that safe and effective vaccines be rapidly 257 developed in order to induce widespread herd immunity in the population and prevent the continued 258 spread of sars-cov-2. our study identified probable peptide targets of both cellular and humoral 259 immune responses against sars-cov-2 using computational methodologies to investigate the entire viral 260 proteome a priori. studies such as these are paramount during the early stages of pandemic vaccine 261 development given the relative scarcity of biological data available on the viral immune response, and we 262 employed an approach that allowed us to systematically refine our predictions using increasingly stringent 263 criteria to select a subset of the most promising epitopes for further study. the data we have curated could 264 inform the design of a candidate peptide-based vaccine or diagnostic against sars-cov-2. 265as selective pressures are known to introduce viral mutations that promote fitness and can lead 266 to evasion of immune responses (59, 60), we first sought to investigate the genetic similarity of all 267 reported sars-cov-2 clinical isolates and identify a consensus sequence for use in our epitope 268 prediction studies. we identified 68 mutations/deletions across the 44 genomes of clinical isolates 269 reported as of 27 february 2020. despite these variations, the viral genomic identity was > 99% 270 conserved across all isolates. as the protein coding sequences were largely conserved, the genome of the 271 original virus isolate (wuhan-hu-1) was deemed a representative consensus sequence for analysis of the 272 sars-cov-2 proteome. 273 cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses will likely be directed against both structural and non-structural 274 proteins during antiviral immune responses, as all viral proteins are accessible for processing and 275 presentation on the hla molecules of infected cells. therefore, we sought to identify t cell epitopes 276 across the entire viral proteome. our analysis identified 83 potential cd8 + t cell epitopes (supp. table  277 s1) and 211 potential cd4 + t cell epitopes (supp . table s2) , with stringent filtering for more 278 promiscuous peptides with high predicted antigenicity yielding a subset of 5 cd8 + t cell epitopes and 36 279 cd4 + t cell epitopes ( table 1 ) as potential targets for vaccine development. a single study by grifoni 280 and colleagues has recently reported the computational identification of 241 cd4 + t cell epitopes from 281 sars-cov-2 (35), and 22 peptides from our analysis shared sequence homology or were nested within 282 peptides identified in their study. moreover, seven peptides from this initial report were replicated in our 283 final subset of hla class ii epitopes, supporting that these peptides may be promising vaccine targets. 284an increasing number of studies have employed predictive algorithms to identify potential hla 285 class i epitopes for sars-cov-2, although relatively few have comprehensively analyzed the entire viral 286 proteome. a report from feng et al. recently outlined the identification of 499 potential class i epitopes in 287 the main structural proteins from sars-cov-2 but did not consider any non-structural proteins (38). 288grifoni and colleagues conducted a more rigorous analysis, identifying 628 unique cd8 + t cell epitopes across all sars-cov-2 proteins but focusing their analyses solely on peptides with sequence homology 290 to known sars-cov epitopes (35). our approach initially identified ~ 3,500 potential cd8 + t cell 291 epitopes across all viral proteins, which we refined to a subset of 5 peptides (table 1) . one peptide 292 derived from orf1ab (mmisagfsl) was predicted to bind hla-a*02:01 with high affinity (ic 50 = 6.9 293 nm) ( figure 2c) . given the prevalence of this allele in the american and european populations (25-60% 294 frequency) (61), mmisagfsl may represent a promising epitope capable of providing broad vaccine 295 population coverage. 296we also observed a notable enrichment of epitopes predicted to bind hla-b molecules-297 particularly hla-b*15:01-as we imposed more stringent selection criteria ( figure 2b ). all five peptides 298 identified by our approach were predicted to be relatively strong binders for this allele (ic 50 = 67.7 nm), 299 with molecular docking simulations illustrating strong contacts with amino acid residues in the peptide 300 binding groove (figure 3 a, b) . a recent computational study identified another hla-b allele (b*15:03) 301 as having a high capacity for presenting epitopes from sars-cov-2 that were conserved among other 302 pathogenic coronaviruses (62). these data collectively suggest the hla-b locus may be significantly 303 associated with the immune response to sars-cov-2 (and potentially other coronaviruses), with further 304 biological studies warranted to determine the true role of host genetics in sars-cov-2 immunology. 305lastly, we analyzed the primary structural proteins of sars-cov-2 (s, n, m, e proteins) for 306 potential b cell epitopes, as an ideal vaccine would be designed to stimulate both cellular and humoral 307 immunity. our analysis identified potential linear b cell epitopes in all proteins except for the e protein 308 ( table 2 ). the greatest number of epitopes were predicted in the surface-exposed s protein (n=26), but a 309 significant number of epitopes were also predicted for the n protein (n=14). this is not surprising, as 310 previous reports identified the n protein as a significant target of the humoral response to sars-cov 311 (63, 64). as the s protein is the predominant surface protein and has been the primary target of 312 neutralizing antibody responses against other coronaviruses (56, 57), we elected to focus our subsequent 313 analyses solely on antigenic regions in the s protein. we identified 14 potential structural epitopes in the 314 s protein structure and referenced against our linear epitope predictions to identify six regions that were 315 independently identified by both analyses (table 2, figure 4) to further evaluate the potential of these six antigenic regions as targets for antibody binding, we 319 modeled their surface accessibility on the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 spike protein (52). four 320 regions in the s1 domain (d405-d428; n440-n450; g496-p507; d568-t573) were solvent exposed 321 (figure 4 a, b) , with minimal steric hindrance for antibody accessibility. the s1 domain contains the 322 residues (n331-v524) important for virus binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) on the cell surface (65), and studies have shown that antibodies with potent neutralizing activity against sars-cov 324 target this domain (66-68). indeed, three of the four s1 epitopes identified in our analyses are located in 325 the ace2-binding region, supporting their potential utility in vaccine development against sars-cov-2. 326two regions were identified in the s2 "stalk" domain of the s protein (figure 4 a, c) . while y1138-327 d1146 is located at the base of the s protein and likely inaccessible to antibodies, p792-d796 is on the 328 outer face of the protein and has been previously identified as part of a larger b cell epitope that is 329 conserved with sars-cov (35). as sars-cov s2-specific antibodies have previously been shown to 330 possess antiviral activity (66), it is interesting to speculate whether a strategy similar to targeting the 331 influenza hemagglutinin protein stalk could be employed for developing a broadly reactive coronavirus 332 vaccine. 333our study possessed several strengths and limitations. rather than restricting our analyses of 334 hla class i and class ii epitopes to specific proteins based on prior studies of sars-cov immunology, 335we investigated the complete proteome of sars-cov-2 using an unbiased approach. furthermore, we 336 employed a multi-tiered strategy for identifying putative b cell and t cell epitopes from all viral proteins 337 studied. our initial analyses were performed with liberal thresholds for epitope identification, and at each 338 additional step, we imposed more stringent selection criteria to filter these peptides to a subset of b cell 339 and t cell epitopes for further study. nevertheless, the results of this study are derived purely from 340 computational methods, and it should be noted that computational algorithms can fail to capture a 341 significant number of antigenic peptides (69). experimental validation with biological samples will 342 ultimately be needed. 343during the early stages of a pandemic, access to sufficient biological samples may be extremely 344 limited, so we must continue to utilize methodologies-such as computational predictive algorithms-345 that allow us to explore the epitope landscape for experimental vaccine development. our approach in this 346 study allowed us to identify and refine a manageable subset of t cell and b cell epitopes for further 347 testing as components of a sars-cov-2 vaccine. based on our results, our proposed sars-cov-2 348 vaccine formulation could contain the following: 1) one or more b cell peptide epitopes from the s 349 protein to generate protective neutralizing antibodies; and 2) multiple hla class i and class ii-derived 350 peptides from other viral proteins to stimulate robust cd8 + and cd4 + t cell responses. based on global 351 allele frequencies, these class i and class ii peptides would be expected to collectively provide 74% and 352 99% population coverage, respectively. while such a vaccine could be readily formulated as a synthetic 353 polypeptide or an adjuvanted peptide mixture, these strategies may not retain the epitope structural 354 features necessary to induce a robust antibody response. recombinant nanoparticles and assembly into 355vlps represent promising alternative vaccine platforms, as they have been extensively used for the 356 controlled display and delivery of peptide-based vaccine components (70-73). by omitting whole viral 357 proteins from the vaccine formulation, a peptide-based sars-cov-2 vaccine should have a well-358 tolerated safety profile and avoid the adverse events previously observed with experimental sars-cov 359 vaccines (19) (20) (21) (22) . 360in summary, we have identified 41 potential t cell epitopes (5 hla class i, 36 hla class ii) and 361 6 potential b cell epitopes from across the sars-cov-2 proteome that are predicted to have broad 362 population coverage and could serve as the basis for designing investigational peptide-based vaccines. 363further study on the biological relevance and immunogenicity of these peptides is warranted in an effort 364 to develop a safe and effective vaccine to combat the sars-cov-2 pandemic. 365the authors would

analysis of samples collected from admitted patients had revealed that a novel beta-coronavirus was the causative pathogen [2] . this rna virus was temporarily known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), but was renamed later as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) [3] . the disease caused by this virus is known as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) , it is usually characterized by fever, dry cough, fatigue and muscles pain. additionally, dyspnea can be observed in some patients and it may progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) [4] . the transmission of sars-cov-2 is largely dependent on respiratory droplets generated through sneezing or coughing [5] . the median incubation period of sars-cov-2 is estimated to be 5.1 days with 95% confidence interval of 4.5 to 5.8 days [6] . the outbreak of sars-cov-2 was recognized as a global pandemic threat on march 11, 2020 [7] .sars-cov-2 has a genomic sequence similarity of 79% with a previously known coronavirus,protein with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2). however, the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 seems to be 10-20 times higher [9] . it is believed that covid-19 pathogenesis may involve blockade of ace2 and subsequent imbalance between angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin ii. this suggests that ace2 may be further involved in pathogenesis beyond viral entry point [10] .similar to sars-cov, no specific treatment is currently available to combat covid-19.however, management of ards does involve the use of oxygen-based therapy and antibiotics against possible sepsis [11] . in attempts to fight covid-19, clinical trials are keep going to assess the effect of several antiviral agents like remdesivir [12] . additionally, computational modelling attempts have proposed the repurposing of several fda approved drugs against sars-cov-2 [13, 14] .in the same time, no vaccine was ever developed for any coronavirus. however, advanced techniques had been employed to generate potential sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates like mrna based vaccine, viral vector vaccine and viral subunit vaccine [15] . recently, immunoinformatics tools had been used to screen sars-cov-2 proteins for potential b-cells and tcells epitopes [16, 17] . the prediction of these epitopes had enabled virtual design of peptide based vaccine against sars-cov-2 [18]. 3 previously, we have predicted several potential epitopes within sars-cov-2 spike protein sequence. of interest was the linear b-cells epitope with sequence 'gfncyfplqsygf', this epitope is believed to be part of spike protein receptor binding protein (rbd) that is involved in interaction with ace2 [17, 19] . in the current study, we have constructed a peptide-based vaccine design by combining seven potential epitopes predicted from our previously published findings [17] . then, we have evaluated this vaccine design by using several immunoinformatics tools to affirm its stability, safety and efficiency. the aim of this study is to present a multiepitope-based peptide vaccine design for potential use against sars-cov-2.a flowchart that summarizes the steps of vaccine construction and evaluation study can be seen in figure 1 .we have selected seven potential epitopes for the construction of vaccine candidate. the sequence of these epitopes can be seen in table 1 , they have high antigenicity, low allergenicity and good stability against selected proteases as predicted by our previously published study [17] . table 1 : linear epitopes previously predicted on sars-cov-2 spike protein crystal.epitope sequence epitope type major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecule are highly polymorphic and expressed at after population coverage analysis, these seven epitopes were then merged together in a sequential manner by using aay linker. this linker is considered as a cleavage site of mammalians proteasomes and can increase epitopes presentation by enhancing the formation of natural epitopes and reducing the formation of junctional epitopes the secondary structure of vaccine construct was predicted by using psipred 4.0 tool [29].while tertiary structure was modelled by using sparks-x, this web-based tool can recognize protein folding through sequence alignment [30]. for these prediction tools, the sequence of vaccine design was submitted as one letter code. to further improve vaccine tertiary structure, the generated pdb file was then submitted to galaxy refine server. this refinement server applies molecular dynamics (md) simulation to implement repeated cycles of structural perturbation with subsequent relaxation [31]. 6 vaccine structure validation:the peptide vaccine structure was submitted as pdb file to rampage server for md analysis was carried out for 10 nanoseconds by using the same protocol applied in our previously published article [14] .the ability of peptide vaccine to activate various components of host immune system was predicted by using c-immsim server. this modelling platform combines the dynamics of immune system together with genomic information [44] . at first, the vaccine sequence was the selected six t-cells epitopes showed high predicted population coverage according to mhc restricted alleles. according to figure 2 , the worldwide coverage of these epitopes was the primary sequence of peptide vaccine was constructed by merging the seven potential epitopes together by using aay linker, while the adjuvant human beta-defensin 2 chain a was linked to the n-terminus of vaccine construct by using the rigid linker eaaak. the primary structure of peptide vaccine can be seen in figure 3 (a) as one letter format. prediction of vaccine secondary structure as appeared in figure 3 (b) revealed that the percentage of βstrand, α-helix and coil are 10, 53 and 37 respectively. the tertiary structure of vaccine design was modelled by using sparks-x server with a z-score of 5.26, the model was further refined by using galaxy refine server with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.496 from initial build. the refined tertiary structure of peptide vaccine can be seen in figure 3 (c). and epitopes are also colored by gold, light blue and red respectively. 9 a summary of predicted physicochemical properties, immunogenicity and allergenicity of vaccine construct can be observed in table 2. according to this table, the peptide the validation results of vaccine refined tertiary structure can be observed in figure 4 . based on analysis of ramachandran plot in figure 4 (a) , 93.2% of residues are in favored position of torsional angles plot while 4.8% are in allowed region. only 2.0% of the residues in the refined model are considered outliers. then, the z-score of the refined model was recorded to be -3.59 by using prosa-web tool. this quality score is located within the z-scores range calculated for native proteins of similar size as can be seen in figure 4 (b) . the model quality was also assessed, as presented in figure 4 (c) , by plotting predicting energy as a function of sequence position. the plot for window size of 40 residues is smoother than 10 residues size.as obvious, our refined model may have some structural flaws as the predicted energy for window size of 40 residues jumps slightly higher than zero in part of the plot. finally, the overall quality score of errat server is reported to be 82.645. this score represents the percentage of protein sequence with predicted error value that falls below rejection limit. a plot of error value versus residues number can be seen in figure 4 (d). all the above structural validation results predict that the refined construct has a good stability with minor flaws. candidate, the 99% and 95% lines represent confidence interval for rejection limit.molecular docking analysis of vaccine construct against tlr8 had generated many potentialcomplexes. an overview for docking result of the first ranked complex can be seen in figure   5 . this vaccine-tlr8 complex has a geometric shape complementarity score of 17544 with approximate interface area of 2745.70. a cartoon representation for this complex is well presented in figure 5 (a) . according to analysis of protein-protein interface illustrated in figure 5 (b), the peptide vaccine was able to form 5 hydrogen bonds with tlr8 interface residues. the anticipated length of these bonds is less than 3.5 angstrom. and tlr8 can be seen in figure 6 . based on total potential energy calculations in figure 6 (a), the complex looks to be stable with minimal changes in potential energy predicted throughout simulation period. however, the vaccine construct seems to exhibit a higher 12 flexibility per residue than tlr8 as noted from root mean square fluctuation (rmsf) calculations in figure 6 (b). the residues of peptide vaccine show a higher variation in position from its simulation time averaged position (reference position). the results of both molecular docking and dynamics simulation may indicate the preferential binding of vaccine design to toll-like receptor 8. an rmsf value of zero refers to the absence of residue in the molecule under simulation. 13 finally, the results of simulation for host immune response against injected vaccine can be seen in figure 7 . as predicted by simulation server, we found that three injections of vaccine construct with a time frame of 4 weeks between each two doses are necessary to produce loglasting and efficient immune response. according to figure 7 glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and major protective antigen of the sars-23cov-2. broad-scale in vitro characterization of recombinant vaccine candidate 24 demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (hn) of 25aoav-1 and s protein of sars-cov-2, and comparable replication kinetics were 26observed in cell culture model. the recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively 27 replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. interestingly, 28incorporation of s protein of sars-cov-2 into the recombinant aoav-1 particles 29attributed the sensitivity to anti-sars-cov-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-30aoav-1 antiserum. finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine 31vector stably expressed s protein after multiple propagation in chicken embryonated 32 eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics 33 of the recombinant. taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is 34 highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human, 35 and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against covid-19 for 36 clinical studies. an outbreak of pneumonia was erupted in chinese seafood market in wuhan during 53 late 2019 and within a month of its origin, on 30 january 2020, a public health 54emergency of international concern was declared by the world health organization 55 (who) due to its high human-to-human transmission. within next month, the outbreak 56 of coronavirus disease in 2019 (covid-19) soared among communities 57 unprecedentedly and spread across the globe and a pandemic was declared on 11 58march 2020 by who. a large proportion (~80%) of covid-19 infected patients 59showed only moderate symptoms which led to staggering rate increase in global 60spread of the infection. the acute respiratory distress syndrome, manifested in ~20% 61of covid-19 patients, caused substantial case fatality rates especially in elderly and 62frail people with co-morbidities 1 .the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), the causative 65 agent of ongoing covid-19 pandemic, belongs to the family coronavirdae within the 66betacoronavirus non-structural proteins (nsp 1-16) and multiple accessary proteins. amongst these 71 viral proteins, the s protein constitute a major protective antigen that elicit highly 72 specific antibodies mediated immune responses 2 . therefore, the s protein remained 73 the primary vaccine markers against coronaviruses.currently, there is no registered drugs or vaccines available to curb the pandemic; 76 however, multiple vaccines using a range of technologies are being developed, or pre-77 clinically or clinically being investigated 3 . amongst these, an inactivated vaccine has 78 elicited strong antibodies which can neutralize multiple sars-cov-2 strains and can 79 partially or fully protect macaques against sars-cov-2 challenge 4 . a chimpanzee 80 adeno (chad)-vectored vaccine, expressing the full-length s gene of sars-cov-2, 81 elicited humoral and cell-mediated responses in rhesus macaques 5 . however, it failed 82 to fully alleviated clinical signs in vaccinated macaques albeit reduced severity and 83 protection against pneumonia. the chadox1 ncov-19 also failed to reduce the viral 84 replication in the nose, highlighting the potential spread of sars-cov-2 through 85 sneezing even in vaccinated people 5 . 86 87owing to multifaceted advantages, the avian orthoavulavirus 1 (aoav-1) proposes a 88 potential vaccine vector against sars-cov-2. specifically, aoav-1 (represented by 89 a type species, newcastle disease virus, ndv) are exclusively cytoplasmic viruses 90and therefore the viral gene segments are not integrated into the host genome which 91 raises their safety profile. since these vectors lack natural recombination, the 92 expression of transgenes is genetically stable. additionally, aoav-1 can infect multiple 93 species of animals, the vaccines can be produced in chicken embryonated eggs and 94 multiple cell lines 6 . given these and other features, apathogenic strains of aoav-1 95have been used as live attenuated vaccines against multiple viruses including 96 influenza, sars, human immunodeficiency virus 7,8 , human parainfluenza, rabies 9 , 97nipah disease 10 , rift valley fever 11 , ebola and highly pathogenic h5n1 12,13 . 98importantly, aoav-1 has appeared to be safe and effective in mice 10,13 , dogs 9 , pigs 10 , 99 cattle 14,15 , sheep 14 , african green and rhesus monkeys 16,17 and humans 18-21 . notably, 100the natural host of aoav-1 are birds and the vector is antigenically distinct from 101 common human pathogens. therefore, no pre-existing immunity in human make it an 102 ideal vector to deliver transgene effective and safely.in the present study, we de novo designed an aoav-1 vector and generated a 105 recombinant vaccine candidate by expressing full-length codon optimized s protein of 106 the sars-cov-2 at a pre-optimized gene junction. this topical respiratory vaccine 107 candidate was fully characterized in vitro. based on the infection and spreadability 108 within cells, its sensitivity to anti-aoav-1 and anti-sars-cov-2 neutralizing 109antibodies, its replication kinetics and stability in chicken embryonated eggs, the 110 raoav-1-sars-cov-2 is a scalable topical vectored vaccine candidate against 111 sars-cov-2 to be tested for safety and immunogenicity in animal studies. 112 113design and construction of aoav-1-sars-cov-2 vaccine candidate. an 116 avirulent strain of aoav-1 was used to construct vaccine candidate against sars-117cov-2. the full length antigenomic sequence of aoav-1, originally isolated from 118 asymptomatic wild birds, was de novo synthesised. to facilitate minigenome 119 transcription, an autocatalytic and "rule-of-six" adhered hammerhead ribozyme 120 sequences was introduced in both 5' and 3'-ends of the antigenome (fig. 1a) .an expression cassette containing the kozak sequence, ge, gs, ig and the orf for 123 the full-length s gene was codon-optimized for homo sapiens codon usage and 124inserted into the unique pmei site between p and m genes, which was originally 125preserved during the cloning of complete antigenome (fig. 1a) . the construct was 126 named raoav-1-sars-cov-2 whereas the aoav-1 without the insertion of the 127 foreign gene (aoav-1-wt) was used as infection control throughout the study. the 128orientation of the inserted s gene was confirmed by the nucleotide sequence analysis. individually inoculated eggs, using real-time pcr and hemagglutination assays, has 134identified successfully rescued raoav-1-sars-cov-2 viruses ( fig. 1  135 supplementary) which were used to fully characterize in the presented study. where a vast majority of raoav-1-sars-cov-2-infected cells expressed both hn and 144 s proteins simultaneously (fig. 1d) .both recombinant and wild type aoav-1 isolates replicated at high titre in eggs (≥28 147 hau/ml, data not shown). the evaluation of the viral replication in the presence of 148 exogenous proteases in vero cells indicated that raoav-1 expressing codon 149 optimized s gene replicated at the level comparable to wild type aoav-1 (fig. 1e) . 150 the expression analysis of the s protein by western blot indicated a potent expression 151 of the full-length s protein in raoav-1-sars-cov-2-infected cells whereas expression 152 of the hn proteins was detected in both recombinant and wt aoav-1-infected cells 153( fig. 1f and fig. 3 supplementary) . these results confirm that the expression of the 154 transgene (s) didn't interfere with the growth characteristics of the aoav-1 and could 155 be a replication competitive vaccine candidate.exogenous trypsin independent growth characteristics of vaccine construct. 158to initiate virus replication, the f protein of the aoav-1 has to be cleaved by cellular 159proteases 22 . in order to investigate the pre-requisite of exogenous trypsin-like 160 extracellular proteases for the infectivity of aoav-1, eggs-propagated raoav-1- of the infection, confirmed a gradual spread of the infection (fig. 2b) . co-expression 170 fluorescence profile highlighted the co-localization of both surface proteins (fig. 2c) . 171similar to recombinant aoav-1, the aoav-1-wt replicated to a similar extent over the 172 course of two days post-infection without the need of exogenous extracellular 173proteases and saturated level of expression of the hn protein was observed at 48 174 hours post-infection ( fig. 2d and fig. 2 supplementary) . the cumulative 175fluorescence dynamics (fig. 2e ) and fluorescence profile (fig. 2f) confirmed the 176 active and progressive expression and hn-specific staining, respectively. taken  177 together, these results confirm the active replication, and expression of aoav-1 and 178foreign genes in vero cells independently of exogenous trypsin.the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 is sensitive to aoav-1 and sars-cov-2 antisera. the 181f and hn surface glycoproteins are critical for receptor binding as well as membrane 182fusion which are indispensable for virus entry and subsequent initiation of the virus 183replication 22,23 . in contrast, the coronaviruses have only a single enveloped 184 glycoprotein which perform dual functions of receptor binding and membrane fusion 24 . 185in order to understand the influence of the s protein of the sars-cov-2 on the 186 infectivity of recombinant virus, the sensitivities of aoav-1 and sars-cov-2 antisera 187were assessed and compared for neutralization. as expected, the aoav-1-wt was 188 resistant to mock antiserum neutralization and was almost fully neutralized by the 189 serum against the aoav-1 (fig. 3a) . quantitatively, the anti-aoav-1 antiserum 190 reduced the infection of aoav-1-wt in vero cells by ~92% compared to the mock-191 neutralization (fig. 3b) . neutralization analysis of the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 showed 192 a significant blockage of the virus replication by pre-incubation and subsequent 193infection of raoav-1-sars-cov-2 with either anti-aoav-1 antiserum or anti-sars-194cov-2 anti-serum (fig. 3c) . there was no neutralization observed upon virus's 195 treatment with the naïve mouse control serum. compared to mock-neutralization, as 196high as 90% inhibition of the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 was observed with anti-aoav-1 197antiserum and ~40% inhibition was noticed using anti-sars-cov-2 anti-serum (fig.  198  3d) . these observations confirm that the incorporation of s protein of sars-cov-2 199 into the recombinant aoav-1 particles attributed the sensitivity of the aoav-1 to anti-200 sars-cov-2 antiserum and anti-aoav-1 antiserum.in vitro growth characterization of the vaccine construct. in order to understand 203 the replication competence of raoav-1-sars-cov-2 and aoav-1-wt, a multistep 204 growth kinetics was evaluated in vero cells. the time-course quantitative 205 measurement of the genomic copies confirmed that the expression of the s gene didn't 206interfere with the viral replication and the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 replicated 207 competitively and comparability with the aoav-1-wt (fig. 4a) . the cell lysate from 208 same experimental setting was used to assess the expression of the aoav-1 209 structural proteins. the expression analysis using western blotting demonstrated that 210both aoav-1-wt (fig. 4b) and raoav-1-sars-cov-2 (fig. 4c) s-gene expression-confirmed viruses were passaged in 8-days-old embryonated 220 chicken eggs for five consecutive passages. both raoav-1-sars-cov-2 and aoav-2211-wt replicated substantially in eggs (≥28 hau/ml, data not shown). the comparative 222replication competence was assessed between first and fifth eggs passaged viruses 223in vero cells. the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 expressing the s protein of the sars-cov-224 2 grew efficiently and at the level of the aoav-1-wt in the first passage as well as after 225 5 th passage in the embryonated eggs (fig. 5a) . correspondingly, the expression of 226 the structural protein of the aoav-1 further confirmed the stable propagation of the wt 227and recombinant viruses at least for several passages (fig. 5b and fig. 3  228  supplementary) . the sequence integrity of the inserted s gene as well as the p and 229m junction was assessed without any mutations. additionally, sequencing of the s 230 gene from the first and fifth passages confirmed no unwanted mutations in purified 231viruses. these results demonstrate that the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 expresses s gene 232stably and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics 233 of the recombinants. 234 235the precipitously increasing deaths, negative impact on lives and livelihood, and 238trembling economies warrant the urgent development of sars-cov-2 vaccine which 239 would be safe, efficacious and scalable. amongst experimental vaccines being 240presented for sars-cov-2, the vectored-based vaccines hold potential for effective 241 vaccine against covid-19 3 . however, each viral vector inherit multiple advantages 242 and disadvantages and careful consideration of gene delivery system may pave the 243 way for an effective vaccine.we propose here a pre-tested vaccine vector based on the recombinant apathogenic 246 strain of aoav-1 (i.e. ndv). we engineered aoav-1 to express the full-length s 247 glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 which is a vital viral neutralization and major protective while the mechanism of host range-restriction needs investigations, it is known that 253aoav-1 induces a strong interferon response in mammalian cells which in turn limit 254 its replication 26,27 . additionally, sialic acid receptors for the viral attachment might show 255 fundamental differences between avian and mammalian hosts and thus define the 256 host restriction. it has been observed that bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, another 257 paramyxovirus in the same family, determine the host range restriction through 258 multiple viral proteins 28 . notwithstanding, aoav-1 are clearly highly restricted to 259primates and this selective replication is irrespective of any of the known pathotypes 260such as mesogenic or lentogenic strains of aoav-1 29 . 261 262in addition to above mentioned factors, the aoav-1 carries a range of advantages 263 over multiple other vectors. similar to other paramyxoviruses, aoav-1 enters host cells by direct fusion at the 277 plasma membrane through a ph-independent mechanism 32,33 . the aoav-1 can also 278 enter host cells by an endocytic pathway. the entry of the aoav-1 in the cell is then 279 mediated by the surface fusion (f) glycoprotein, which is also a major determinant of 280aoav-1 virulence in birds 34 . the viral infectivity requires cleavage of the f protein 281 through the intracellular ubiquitous proteases including furin, allowing disseminated 282 replication in multiples organs and tissues. a mechanism similar to aoav-1, raoav-2831-sars-cov-2 entry the cells through proteolytic cleavage of the s protein 24 . the 284trypsin-independent infectivity of raoav-1-sars-cov-2, as was observed in our 285 study, facilitated the vector propagation in cells culture model as well as embryonated 286 chicken eggs.it has previously been shown that insertion of the transgene may allow the vector 289 sensitive to neutralization by antibodies which are specific to the inserted protein and 290 may facilitate the seepage of neutralization by vector-specific neutralizing 291antibodies 25, 35 . the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 expresses both the native structural hn 292 protein as well as s glycoprotein and therefore the entry into the cell may be attributed 293to the aoav-1-like or sars-cov-2-like. in conjunction to this hypothesis, the anti-294aoav-1 antiserum as well as anti-sars-cov-2 could substantially block the entry of 295 the raoav-1-sars-cov-2. additionally, the recombinant aoav-1-sars-cov-2 296 offers an exciting system to underpin functional interactions between native and 297foreign envelope glycoproteins in one viral particle.recently, insertion of the foreign genes in the backbone of the aoav-1 has been 300 practiced for multiple viruses including influenza, sars, human immunodeficiency 301 virus 7,35 , human parainfluenza, rabies 9 , nipah disease 10 , rift valley fever 11 , ebola and 302 highly pathogenic h5n1 12,13 . in several studies, it has been demonstrated that 303insertion of the transgene into the genomes of aoav-1 resulted in reduced 304 pathogenicity in poultry birds. this safety was maintained even after the expression of 305 the ha gene from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus 11-13 . sustained, stable and 306progressive replication of both wt and recombinant viruses demonstrated effective 307 spread within cells independently. 308 309taken together, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vector expressing s 310 protein propagated stably in chicken embryonated eggs for several consecutive 311 passages, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth 312characteristics of the recombinants. the presented respiratory vaccine candidate has 313the potential for further development as vaccine vector to be available for expedited 314 vaccine development for pre-clinical and clinical studies. 315 316cells and viruses. aoav-1-wt vaccine vector was rescued as described previously 36 have assessed the optimal gene expression when inserted between p and m 333 gene 35, 37, 38 . this arrangement of the gene is identical among all aoav-1. 334in order to offer a competitive reverse genetic system as a novel vaccine vector, an 336 avirulent strain of aoav-1 was used carrying lentogenic-alike (e.g. ndv) cleavage site 337and pathogenicity (patent pending on the technology). the full length antigenomic 338 sequence of aoav-1, originally isolated from asymptomatic wild birds, was partially 339 de novo synthesised (nbs biologicals, uk) using a novel sequence modification 340approach. rest of the genome length mainly constituting around the p gene was 341 cloned using overlapping pcrs. the entire cassette was then shuttled into the 342 tvt7r(0,0) (addgene plasmid #98631). in order to avoid incorporation of an extra 343non-viral gene residues into the transcribed minigenome and efficient transcription of 344 the gene, an autocatalytic and "rule of six" adhered hhrz was introduced at the 5'-345 end and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (hdvrz) at the 3' end of the antigenome.an expression cassette for the full-length s gene was first in silico generated, 348containing the kozak sequence, ge, gs, ig and the orf for the full length s gene 349 was codon-optimized for homo sapiens codon usage and inserted into the unique 350pmei site between p and m genes, which was originally preserved during the cloning 351 of complete antigenome. the construct was named raoav-1-sars-cov-2 whereas 352the aoav-1 without the insertion of the foreign gene (aoav-1-wt) was used as 353infection control throughout the study. the orientation of the inserted s gene was 354 confirmed by the nucleotide sequence analysis at the time of cloning as well as during 355the propagation of the vector in cells and chicken embryonated eggs.the raoav-1-sars-cov-2 and aoav-1-wt were used to rescue the infectious viruses 358as described previously 36 at -80 before inoculating into 8-days-old embryonated chicken eggs. after additional 365 three days, individual eggs were screened using hemagglutination assay and real-366 time pcr as we described before [39] [40] [41] permeabilized with 0.1% triton x-100 for 10 min. after blocking of the cells with 5% 399 bovine serum albumin (bsa) in pbs, they were incubated with monoclonal antibody 400 (mab) 44 to probe hn or s or both proteins. binding of primary antibodies were 401 visualized using alexa 488 α-rabbit and 568 α-mouse secondary antibodies 402(invitrogen). the s and hn proteins expression were analysed through fluorescence 403for wild-type and recombinant viruses compared to mock infected cells. the 40,6-404 diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) was used to stain cell nuclei and the images were 405 captured using a zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope (zeiss, kohen, germany). 406digital images were processed using adobe illustrator software, and the same 407 parameters were applied to the whole image area. competing interests 438the authors declare no competing interests. 439 440supplementary figures are associated with this manuscript. 442 443should robustly activate both the humoral and the cell-mediated immunity to establish strong protection against the pathogen [10] . the antibody generation by b-cell activation as well as acute viral clearance by t-cells along with virus-specific memory generation by cd8+ tcells are equally important to develop immunity against the coronavirus [11] . in case of respiratory virus like coronaviruses, the mucosal immunity plays an essential role and therefore route of administration of the vaccine is also important in the context of vaccine development. vaccines designed against previously reported sars-cov and mers-cov majorly focuses on the spike protein of virus which consists of s1 and s2 subunits bearing the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the virus and cell fusion machinery respectively.mutations in the spike protein have also been reported to be responsible for the change in host cell tropism [12] . the s protein is considered most antigenic and thereby can evoke immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus attachment to the host cells [13] . other viral proteins which were explored for vaccine development include n protein, e protein and the nsp16 proteins [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . almost all the platforms for vaccine development for sars-cov and mers-cov have been investigated including the lifeattenuated ones, recombinant viruses, sub-unit protein vaccines, dna vaccines, viral vectorbased vaccines, nanoparticle-based vaccines, etc. which may form the base for the vaccine designing against the newly emerged sars-cov-2 [10, 19] . here we have designed a multiepitope-based vaccine for the sars-cov-2 using next generation vaccinology approach where the recently available genome and proteome of the sars-cov-2 were maneuvered and a potential vaccine candidate was conceived. similar strategy was employed previously for sars-cov and mers-cov [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] as well as certain findings are reported for the newly emerged sars-cov-2 [26] [27] [28] . while immunoinformatics techniques was utilized by groups to predict the b-cell and cytotoxic t-cell epitopes in the sars-cov-2 surface glycoprotein, n protein [27] [28] [29] , others have utilized the information to design epitope-based vaccine based on the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein [26] . along with the structural proteins, utilizing the non-structural and accessory proteins for the vaccine development can aid in better development of an efficacious vaccine for long term by neutralizing the mutation rate of this rna virus. in this study, we explored the whole proteome of sars-cov-2 to scrutinize the highly conserved antigenic epitopes for the construction of a multi-epitope vaccine candidate that can effectively elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against covid-19. the constructed vaccine product has high population coverage and along with adaptive immunity, can as well lead to initiation of innate immune response further enhancing the generation of memory immunity.with the continuous transmission of the virus across borders and increasing health burden on the global scale, sars-cov-2 demands an urgent immunization therapy. as depicted by shan lu, the community acquired coronavirus infection (caci) caused by this virus can shatter the socio-economic condition worldwide and the development of vaccine against the sars-cov-2 should be encouraged to manage the present situation as well as it can serve as a prototype for other coronaviruses [30, 31] . thereby, our analysis provides a platform for the development of a protective vaccine candidate that can be tested in-vitro and in-vivo and may lead to faster development of an efficient vaccine against the sars-cov-2 infection.the complete proteome of latest reported novel wuhan strain of sars coronavirus (sars-cov-2) was downloaded from the nucleotide database available at national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). the database was also thoroughly searched for the genomes of other available human infecting strains of coronavirus till date and was downloaded for further analysis.for the antigenic analysis of the proteome of the covid-19 strain, vaxijen v2.0 server available at http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/vaxijen/vaxijen.html [32] .for antigenicity prediction of the proteins of sars-cov-2 with higher accuracy, virus model available at the vaxijen server with a threshold of 0.4 was utilized.proteins with a vaxijen score ≥ 0.4 were taken for epitope prediction analysis.mhc class i and ii alleles were selected on the basis of their occurrence worldwide.we focused specially on the countries which are severely affected by the deadly [33] . for mhc ii, drb1_0101,   drb1_0301, drb1_0401, drb1_0405, drb1_0701, drb1_0802, drb1_0901,   drb1_1101, drb1_1201, drb1_1302, drb1_1501, hla-dpa10103-dpb10101,   hla-dpa10201-dpb10201,  hla-dpa10301-dpb10301,  hla-dqa10101-dqb10201, hla-dqa10301-dqb10301, hla-dqa10401-dqb10401, hla-dqa10501-dqb10501,  hla-dqa10102-dqb10202,  hla-dqa10402-dqb10402 covering 99.71 % world population were used for the epitope screening.various online servers were explored for the accurate prediction of helper t lymphocytes (htl) epitopes. firstly, the antigenic proteins were analyzed by using [37] . only the epitopes with vaxijen score ≥ 0.4 and predicted to be non-toxic and non-allergens, were taken for further screening. the best hla-non-allergenic epitope pair with the highest vaxijen score was taken for constructing the multi-epitope vaccine. [39] and for the allergenicity, the allertop v.2.0 was used (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/method.html) [40] .thereafter, the non-allergenic strong binders with a positive immunogenicity score were checked for their toxic nature by utilizing the toxinpred server (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/motif_scan.php).the presence of selected best epitopes in all the reported human infecting sarscoronavirus strain were checked by using epitope conservancy analysis tool of iedb (http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/) [41] . only the epitopes having 100% conservation were used for multi-epitope vaccine construction.the mhc class i ad class ii molecules were downloaded from rcsb pdb database (https://www.rcsb.org/). those that were not available were in pdb database were retrieved from phla database (https://www.phla3d.com.br/) [42] . the structures of the sars-cov-2 proteins were constructed using i-tasser (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/i-tasser/) [43] and htl and ctl epitopes were mapped and their structures were retrieved using pymol tool. for the molecular interaction analysis of the predicted best hla-epitope pairs for both mhc class i and class ii alleles, cluspro protein-protein docking tool (https://cluspro.org/login.php) [44] was utilized.abcpred tool based on artificial neural network was explored for b-cell epitope prediction (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/abcpred/index.html) [45] . for higher accuracy, the threshold for the prediction was kept 0.90. the predicted epitopes were checked for their antigenicity using vaxijen server, allergenicity by using algpred and toxicity by toxinpred server.for constructing a multi-epitope vaccine construct, the selected best htl, ctl and b-cell epitopes were joined by using gpgpg, aag and kk linkers respectively. for the better immunogenic response, four adjuvants namely, β-defensin, universal memory t cell helper peptide (tpd), padre sequence and a m cell ligand were added by using eaaak linker into the vaccine construct.the antigenicity of the vaccine construct, vaxijen server was exploited. for the allergenicity analysis of the vaccine construct, three different tools namely algpred, allertop and allergenfp v.1.0 (http://ddg-pharmfac.net/allergenfp/index.html) [46] were utilized.to check the population coverage of the vaccine construct, population coverage tool available at iedb (http://tools.iedb.org/population/) [47] server was utilized. the hla class i and class ii alleles in the final construct were entered in the tool and the population coverage of the alleles were calculated for the top 26 countries that are severely affected by the sars-cov-2 virus. the analysis was performed for hla i and hla ii separately as well as in combination.expasy's protparam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) [48] was explored for the physiochemical properties evaluation of the vaccine construct. protparam evaluates the peptide sequence and provides the molecular weight, theoretical pi, extinction coefficient, estimated half-life, instability index, and grand average of hydropathicity (gravy). solubility of the construct was calculated using solpro tool available at scratch protein predictor server (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/) [49] .secondary structure of the multi-epitope vaccine construct was predicted using sopma(https://npsaprabi.ibcp.fr/cgibin/npsa_automat.pl?page=/npsa/npsa_sopma.html) [50] and psi-pred (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) server [51] . for the tertiary structure prediction of the vaccine construct robetta server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org/) based on ab initio and homology modelling was utilized [52] . the predicted structure was refined by using 3d refine (http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/3drefine/) [53] and further by galaxyrefine (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=refine) [54] .the structures were evaluated by constructing ramachandran plot using rampage (http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~rapper/rampage.php) and the quality was assessed using errat server (https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/errat/).the refined modelled structure of the multi-epitope vaccine construct was further evaluated for its stability in the real environment by simulating it in a water sphere using namd-standard molecular dynamics tool (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/research/namd/) by using parallel processors. the required structure files (.psf) were generated by psfgen using visual molecular dynamics (vmd) tool v.1.9.3 by utlizing charmm force fields for proteins. initially, a 10,000 steps energy minimization was performed followed by subsequent heating the system from 0 k to 310 k. thereafter, a 20 ns standard molecular dynamics was performed and trajectory dcd file generated was used to evaluate rmsd. the change in kinetic, potential and total energy was evaluated for these 20 ns simulation using vmd.to check the interaction of the multi-epitope vaccine construct with two immunoreceptors, tlr-3 and tlr-8, cluspro docking server was used and the resultant best complexes were then simulated for 20 ns in a water sphere using namd.escherichia coli k12 satrain, the construct was first converted to cdna using reverse translate tool available at expasy server. the resultant dna was further optimized for enhanced protein expression by using jcat server [55] . finally, the cdna construct was inserted into the pet28a (+) vector using hindiii and bamhi restriction sites.the complete proteome of the wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate wuhan-hu-1 (nucleotide accession number -nc_045512.2) was retrieved from the ncbi database.sars-cov-2 proteome consists of a polyprotein orf1ab and several structural proteins.orf1ab encodes for various non-structural proteins including host translation inhibitor nsp1, rna dependent rna polymerase (rnrp), helicase, guanine-n7 methyltransferase etc. that plays a critical role in the virus multiplication and survival inside the host. structural proteins include spike glycoprotein, envelope protein, membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein.the fasta sequences of all these proteins were retrieved from ncbi and used for epitope screening ( table 1 ). all the sequences were analyzed for their antigenic nature by usingvaxijen server which is based upon auto cross covariance (acc) transformation. vaxijen classifies the proteins into antigens and non-antigens solely based on the physiochemical properties and is sequence alignment independent. the acc score threshold for the virus model is kept 0.4 that increases the prediction accuracy. all the sars-cov-2 proteins except nsp16 (2'-o-ribose methyltransferase) resulted in the acc score higher than 0.4 depicting the antigenic nature of the viral proteome (table 1 ). all the antigenic proteins were further screened for the presence of htl, ctl and b-cell epitopes by using various tools and databases ( figure 1 ).t-lymphocytes play a central role in activating the cell mediated innate and adaptive immune response against the foreign particles. as well they are the sole players in generating immunological memory that provides long lasting immune response. thus, the vaccinology approach revolves around the screening of proteome for the high affinity helper t table s2 ). overlapping sequences were merged into one or both mhc class i and class ii binding epitopes apart from cellular mediated immunity, the humoral immune response mediates pathogen clearance in the antibody dependent manner. hence the proteome of sarc-cov-2 was further scanned for linear b-cell epitopes by using abcpred server. for higher selectivity and sensitivity, the threshold of abcpred was kept 0.9. the predicted epitopes were checked for their antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity and the best epitopes were taken for further consideration. on the basis of above criteria, we received one b-cell epitope each for nucleocapsid, guanine-n7 methyltransferase (exon), orf3a, orf7a, and surface glycoprotein (supplementary table s3 ). the locations of the selected epitopes in the respective protein structures are represented by figure 2 . overall, the antigenic 13 htl and 12 ctl epitopes having highest affinity for the respective hla alleles and 5 b-cell epitopes that are non-allergenic, non-toxic and can generate a potential immune response were selected for incorporation into the multi-epitope vaccine construct.the presence of conserved epitopes in a vaccine can lead to an effective immunization against all the strains of the pathogen. thus, the selected htl, ctl and bcl epitopes were analyzed for their conservancy among the various human infecting strains of coronavirus.interestingly, all the selected epitopes were 100 % conserved throughout the coronavirus family and this can lead to a robust vaccine development. figure 3c ).an ideal vaccine should harbor conserved epitopes, have multi-valency and can elicit both cellular and humoral mediated immune response in the host. a subunit vaccine contains minimal elements that are antigenic and required for the stimulation of prolonged protective or therapeutic immune response. in the recent times, various reports have shown the construction of multi subunit vaccine by utilizing highly antigenic htl, ctl and bcl epitopes. herein, we constructed a multi-epitope vaccine candidate by combining 13 htl, 12ctl and 4 bcl epitopes that were highly conserved, antigenic, non-toxic and non-allergens ( figure 4 ).in the recent times, various small peptides are been explored that acts as an adjuvant and can potentiate the multi-epitope vaccine mediated immune response by activating humoral immunity. taking this into consideration, apart from the conserved epitopes, four adjuvants were also added so as to boost the protective immune response against sars-cov- (table 2) . antigenicity is a preliminary requisite of a successful vaccine candidate. a vaccine construct must possess both immunogenicity and antigenicity to elicit the humoral and cell-mediated immune response.upon analyzing the vaccine construct sequence in vaxijen server, the constructed vaccine was found to be antigenic in nature with an overall prediction score of 0.6199. the score signifies the antigenic potential of the vaccine construct that may have the potential to evoke the immune response inside the host. on allergenicity analysis, all the three tools algpred, allergenfp and allertop supported the non-allergenic nature of the vaccine construct while toxicity analysis revealed the non-toxic behavior of the construct ( table 2 ). in summary, the constructed epitope was observed to be stable, soluble, antigenic, non-allergenic and nontoxic.secondary and tertiary structure helps in the functional annotation of the multi-epitope vaccines. it also helps in analyzing the interaction of this vaccine construct with the immunological receptors like tlrs. secondary structure of the protein was analyzed by using sopma and psipred server that revealed the presence of ~40 % alpha helix, ~20 % β-sheet, ~30 % coils and ~6 % β turns in the vaccine construct ( figure 5 and supplementary figure s3 ). tertiary structure of the vaccine was predicted by threading based homology modelling using robetta server ( figure 6a ). ramachandran plot analysis of the modelled structure revealed the presence of 95.5 % residues in the most favoured regions and 4.5 % in the additionally allowed regions ( figure 6b ). quality factor was analyzed by using errat2 server and was obtained to be 90.47 depicting a good modelled structure ( figure 6c ). to further refine the modelled structure, 3d refine and galaxyrefine were utilized that leads to 97.4 % residues in the most favoured region and 2.6 % residues in the additionally allowed region. the quality factor of the refined structure was observed to be 94.29% depicting the improvement of the modelled structure ( figure 6d -f).refined structure of the model construct was further check for its stability in real environment by simulating it for 20 ns in a water sphere. 10,000 steps energy minimization was performed to minimize the potential energy of the system. unnecessary or false geometry of the protein structures are repaid by performing energy minimization resulting in a more stable stoichiometry. before energy minimization, the potential energy was observed to be -447451.2005 kcal/mol. after 10,000 steps the protein was minimized with a potential energy of -676040.4692 kcal/mol ( figure 7a) . the system was subsequently heated from 0 k to 310 k and then 10 ns molecular dynamic simulation was performed. the temperature remained constant throughout the simulation process ( figure 7b ). the dcd trajectory file was analysed for analysing the movement of the atoms during the simulation course and rmsd was calculated. upon analysing the rmsd of sars-cov-2 vaccine construct, it was observed that, the system gained equilibrium at ~4 ns and then remained constant till 10 ns depicting the stability of the vaccine construct ( figure 7c ). furthermore, upon analysing the change in kinetic, potential and total energy of the system, it was observed that after a quick initial change in all the three, they remained constant throughout the simulation further strengthening the stability of the vaccine construct ( figure 7d-f) . furthermore, the bond energy, vdw energy, dihedral and improper dihedral energy analysis revealed no change throughout the 10 ns dynamics simulation. root mean square fluctuation (rmsf) analysis revealed the rigidness of the atoms in vaccine construct with a slight mobility observed at ~ 120 and 501 residues (supplementary figure s4) . thus, simulation analysis revealed the stability of the vaccine construct in the real environment. the refined vaccine construct structure was therefore used for interaction analysis with immunological receptor tlr3.proteinprotein docking of immune receptor tlr3 and the constructed vaccine was carried out using cluspro server. in total 30 tlr3-vaccine construct complexes were generated. the fifth model with the lowest energy weighted score of -1427.4 was considered as best tlr3vaccine complex (figure 8 a-b and supplementary table s4 ). the vaccine construct interacted with the ligand binding grove of tlr-3 generating a strong tlr3-vaccine construct complex. the stability of the complex was further analyzed by performing 10ns standard molecular dynamics simulation studies using namd suite. the 10,000 steps energy minimization of the complex lead to the generation of a minimized energy complex with energy of -756791.5601 kcal/mol ( figure 8c ). after subsequent heating the system from 0 k to 310 k, the temperature was kept constant throughout ( figure 8d ). energy plots depicted no major changes throughout the simulation ( figure 8e -g and supplementary figure s5 ).rmsf analysis of the complex showed a mobility region at ~740 th residue and ~1100 residue of the tlr3-vaccine complex ( figure 8h ). on trajectory analysis, the rmsd plot was constructed that revealed the major deviations during the initial 1.5 ns, thereafter the system remained constant till 10 ns.for the insertion of the vaccine construct into a plasmid vector, the 602 amino acid long protein sequence was reverse translated to cdna of 1806 nucleotide length. the expression system of the expression host varies with each other and the cdna needs to be adapted as per the host codon usage. for the optimal expression of the vaccine product in escherichia coli k12 host, the resultant cdna was codon optimized according using jcat server. also, during optimization, rho-independent transcription terminator and prokaryotic ribosomal binding sites were avoided in middle of the cdna sequence so as to generate an optimal and complete protein expression. further, for inserting the construct in the cloning vector, the cleavage sites of bamhi and hindiii were also avoided. the cai value (codon adaptation index) of the cdna before adaptation was observed to be 0.5379 and a gc content of 59.52 % ( figure 9a ). after adaptation, the cai score of the improved sequence was increased to 0.946 with 52.54 % gc content ( figure 9b and supplementary data s1). the enhanced cai score depicts the presence of most abundant codons in escherichia coli k12. the adapted cdna sequence was used for in silico cloning purpose.escherichia coli k12 strain was selected as a host for cloning purpose as the expression and purification of multi-epitope vaccines are easier in this bacterium. pet28a(+) expression vector was cleaved using bamhi and hindiii restriction enzyme and the cdna was inserted near the ribosome binding site using snapgene. 6x histidine tag was added at the 3' end for the isolation and purification of the vaccine construct ( figure 9c ).severely affecting humans worldwide. the sars-cov-2 is highly contagious virus with a high mortality rate especially in immunocompromised and elderly persons. vaccines are the utmost need of the time to succumb the rising infections due to covid-19 and represent the best way to combat infectious diseases in the community. conventional vaccine development methods are time-consuming, laborious and expensive and in this regard, the in-silico immuno-informatics approach have proved to a boon [59] . moreover, the availability of large number of efficient tools to predict the immuno-determinants, and large database of information facilitate and accelerate this whole process of vaccine designing [60] . multiepitope vaccines are designed by using the most antigenic conserved part of the pathogen's proteins that makes them more effective and can help in combating the high mutation rate in rna viruses. these epitope-based vaccines have added advantages of being safe, stable, highly specific, cost-curtailing, easy to produce in bulk, and provides option to manipulate the epitopes for designing of a better vaccine candidate [61] . this method of vaccine development has proved to be promising enough for different microbial diseases including both bacterial and viral [25, [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] .herein, we applied reverse vaccinology approach for designing of a multi-epitope secondary structure prediction revealed the predominance of alpha helix while the tertiary structure obtained from threading provides the spatial arrangement of amino-acid in space. the obtained modelled structure was further refined that increased its overall quality.to table s1-s4 and supplementary data s1data conceptualization and methodology was performed by ak. in silcio prediction were performed by nj, us and pm. analysis was performed by nj. nj and pm collectively wrote the manuscript. a.k. did the review and editing. coronavirus is a type of single-stranded rna (ssrna) virus [1] before the emergence of sars-cov-2, there are 6 known human coronaviruses, including the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov). the symptoms caused by sars-cov-2 infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome (~29%), acute cardiac injury (~12%) or acute kidney injury (~7%) [2] , implying that sars-cov-2 may infect various human tissues. covid-19 is a highly infectious disease [3, 4] associated with high mortality [5] . sars-cov-2, the virus responsible for covid-19, is a betacoronavirus [6] . the previous name for this virus was sars-cov-2. the genome of sars-cov-2 has been sequenced [7, 8] . the genomic sequence of sars-cov-2 has 96% similarity to the bat-coronavirus and 76.5% identity to the sars-cov [9] . although there are no approved drugs or vaccines for covid-19, some clinical trials are in progress [10] .lopinavir and ritonavir were used in preliminary clinical studies [3] .nevertheless, in the past two decades, a massive amount of work has been done to understand the molecular basis of the coronavirus infection and evolution, develop an effective treatment in forms of both vaccines and antiviral drugs, and propose efficient measures for viral detection and prevention [11] [12] [13] . structures of many individual proteins of sars, mers, and related coronaviruses, as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins, have been explored along with the experimental testing of anti-viral properties of small compounds [14] [15] [16] . in this context, the use of bioinformatics approaches may help fill the gap of missing data and improve the process of knowledge discovery by elucidating molecular mechanisms behind virus replication, the process of viral attachment to the host cells and the effect on the host molecular pathways [17] . the final understanding of the molecular action of the virus may improve or accelerate the development of anti-viral therapeutic approaches using information and data available for other coronaviruses.therefore, understanding the molecular effects of this virus on human proteins play a pivotal role in prioritizing pharmacological strategies [18] . in this review, the crystal structure of the sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid n-terminal domain (termed as sars-cov-2 n-ntd), as a model for understanding the molecular interactions that govern sars-cov-2 n-ntd binding to ribonucleotides is described. and the unique rna binding site characteristics are discussed, which in turn will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral n protein and viral replication in sars-cov-2, and highly related virus sars-cov. furthermore, it is attempted to propose suitable vaccine candidates by identifying b-cell and t-cell epitopes with computational approaches for drug and vaccine design.structures of many individual proteins of sars, mers, and related coronaviruses, as well as their biological interactions with other viral and host proteins, have been explored along with the experimental testing of anti-viral properties of small compounds [16] . however, experimental data of the same scale for sars-cov-2 may take years to obtain by the research community. by leveraging the previously known information on genome sequences as well as protein structure and function, bioinformaticians have been successfully helping the virologists by structurally characterizing proteins of novel viruses, determining the evolutionary trajectories, identifying interactions with host proteins, and providing other important biological insights. in particular, a plethora of results have been achieved through comparative, or homology, modeling principles [19, 20] . in addition to the global structural genomics 7 because mutant viruses in the s protein is prone to escape the targeted therapeutic with different host-cell receptor binding patterns [39] , as well as antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) effects of s protein antibodies are found in mers coronavirus [41] , there are several limitations on targeting s protein for antiviral approaches. antiviral protease inhibitors may nonspecifically act on the cellular homologous protease, resulting in host cell toxicity and severe side effects. therefore, novel antiviral strategies are needed to combat acute respiratory infections caused by this novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 (fig. 1) .the cov n protein is a multifunctional rna-binding protein necessary for viral rna transcription and replication [42] . it plays many pivotal roles in forming helical ribonucleoproteins during packaging the rna genome, regulating viral rna synthesis during replication, transcription and modulating infected cell metabolism [42, 43] . the primary functions of n protein are binding to the viral rna genome, and packing them into a long helical nucleocapsid structure or ribonucleoprotein (rnp) complex [44, 45] .in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that n protein bound to leader rna, and was critical for maintaining highly ordered rna conformation suitable for replicating, and transcribing the viral genome [43, 45, 46] . more studies implicated that n protein regulated host-pathogen interactions, such as actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis [47, 48] . the n protein is also a highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection, capable of inducing protective immune responses against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 [49] [50] [51] . the common domain architectures of coronavirus n protein are consisting of three distinct but highly conserved parts: an n-terminal rna-binding domain (ntd), a c-terminal dimerization domain (ctd), and intrinsically disordered central ser/arg (sr)-rich linker. previous studies have revealed that the ntd are responsible for rna binding, ctd for oligomerization, and (sr)-rich linker for primary phosphorylation, respectively [52] [53] [54] .the crystal structures of sars-cov n-ntd [55] , infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) n-ntd [56, 57] , hcov-oc43 n-ntd [53] and mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) n-ntd [58] have been solved. the covs n-ntd have been found to associate with the 3' end of the viral rna genome, possibly through electrostatic interactions. additionally, several critical residues have been identified for rna binding and virus infectivity in the n-terminal domain of coronavirus n proteins [58] [59] [60] . however, the structural and mechanistic basis for newly emerged novel sars-cov-2 n protein remains largely unknown. understanding these aspects should facilitate the discovery of agents that specifically block the coronavirus replication, transcription and viral assembly [61] .kang et al. [62] reported the crystal structure of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid n-terminal domain (termed as sars-cov-2 n-ntd), as a model for understanding the molecular interactions that govern sars-cov-2 n-ntd binding to ribonucleotides. this finding will aid in the development of new drugs that interfere with viral n protein and viral replication in sars-cov-2, and highly related virus sars-cov [62] .angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 (ace2), is the host receptor by sars-cov-2 to infect human cells. viruses bind to host receptors on the target cell surface to establish infection. membrane proteins mediated membrane fusion allowed the entry of enveloped viruses [63] . as recently reported, both ncov and sars-cov could use ace2 protein to gain entry into the cells [64] . since the outbreak, many data analysis have shown a wide distribution of ace2 across human tissues, including lung [65] , liver [66] , stomach [67] , ileum [67] , colon [67] and kidney [68] , indicating that sars-cov-2 may infect multiple organs. however, these data showed that at2 cells (the main target cell of sars-cov-2) in the lung expressed rather low levels of ace2 [68] . hence, the ncovs may depend on co-receptor or other auxiliary membrane proteins to facilitate its infection. it is reported that viruses tend to hijack co-expressed proteins as their host factors [69] . for example, hoffmann et al. recently showed that sars-cov-2-s use ace2 for entry and depends on the cellular protease tmprss2 for priming [70] , showing that 2019-ncov infections also require multiple factors.understanding the receptors' usage by the viruses could facilitate the development of intervention strategies. therefore, identifying the potential co-receptors or auxiliary membrane proteins for sars-cov-2 is of great significance.although ace2 is reported to be expressed in the lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney, and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung [71] .sars-cov-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ace2 partners to facilitate the virus entry [72] . to identify the potential candidates, [73] explored the single-cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single-cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported rna virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. consistent with other recent reports, [73] confirmed that ace2 was mainly expressed in lung at2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ecs, rectum ecs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. intriguingly, [73] found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ace2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including anpep, dpp4, and enpep. among them, anpep and dpp4 are the known receptors for human covs, suggesting enpep as another potential receptor for human covs.the viruses target host cells via binding host receptors before engaging the infection cycle. ace2 was proved to be the cell receptor of sars-cov-2, the same receptor as sars-cov [65, 70] . the expression profiles of ace2 across different cell types of different organs will reveal clues of the virus transmission routes and its potential pathogenesis. in previous studies, ace2 was found to express in the esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells, absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon, alveolar type ii cells in the lung, liver cholangiocyte and kidney proximal tubules [66, 67] . these findings suggested that the clinical symptoms of hepatic failure, respiratory injury, acute kidney injury or diarrhoea may be associated with the pervasive ace2 expressing cells in these tissues.however, we and others found that ace2 is lowly expressed, especially in the lung (the main target organ of ncovs), raising the possible existence of co-receptors facilitating ncov infection. it is well recognized that ssrna viruses tend to have multiple receptors [69] . for example, ace2, cd209 (dendritic cell-specific icam-3-grabbing non-integrin 1), clec4g (c-type lectin domain family 4 member g) and clec4m (c-type lectin domain family 4 member m) are receptors of sars-cov [71, 74] . also, other membrane proteins may also assist virus entry [63] .since the viral receptors and co-receptors should be co-expressed on the same cell types, single-cell co-expression patterns covering 400 membrane proteins and 51 known viral receptors was analyzed [64] . after calculating gene expression similarity, they found anpep, enpep and dpp4 are the top three genes correlated with ace4 (r>0.8). interestingly, both anpep and dpp4 are viral receptors of human coronaviruses [75] , while enpep is also a peptidase, despite that its involvement in virus infection is unclear. for mysterious reasons, human coronaviruses use peptidases as their receptors [76] . in addition, li et al. [77] showed co-expression profiles of these molecules, indicating that different human covs target similar cell types across different human tissues.currently, there is no registered treatment or vaccine for the disease. in the absence of a specific treatment for this novel virus, there is an urgent need to find an alternative solution to prevent and control the replication and spread of the virus.vitamin a supplementation reduced morbidity and mortality in different infectious diseases, such as measles, diarrheal disease, measles-related pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, and malaria, as described by semba et al. [78] . keil et al. [79] had reported that vitamin b2 and uv light effectively reduced the titer of mers-cov in human plasma products. atherton et al. [80] had reported that vitamin c increased the resistance of chick embryo tracheal organ cultures to avian coronavirus infection. in addition, the decreased vitamin d status in calves had been reported to cause the infection of bovine coronavirus [81] . vitamin e deficiency had been reported to intensify the myocardial injury of coxsackievirus b3 (a kind of rna viruses) infection in mice [82] . protection d1, the omega-3 pufa-derived lipid mediator, could markedly attenuate influenza virus replication via rna export machinery [83] . dietary selenium deficiency that causes oxidative stress in the host can alter a viral genome so that a normally benign or mildly pathogenic virus can become highly virulent in the deficient host under oxidative stress [84] . the combination of zinc and pyrithione at low concentrations inhibits the replication of sars coronavirus [85] . iron is required for both host and pathogen and iron deficiency can impair host immunity, while iron overload can cause oxidative stress to propagate harmful viral mutations [86] .a combination of interferon-α-2a with ribavirin was administered to patients with severe mers-cov infection and the survival of these patients was improved [87] . during the sars outbreak in 2003, intravenous gammaglobulin (ivig) was used extensively in singapore. however, one-third of critically ill patients developed venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism despite the use of low-molecular-weight heparin prophylactic [88] . thymosin α-1 could increase resistance to glucocorticoid-induced death of the thymocyte [89] . thymosin α-1 could also be used as an immune enhancer to sars patients and it was effective in controlling the spread of the disease [90, 91] . thymopentin (tp5, munox), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active site of thymopoietin, had been shown to restore antibody production in old mice [92] . levamisole can act as either an immunostimulant agent or an immunosuppressive agent depending upon the dosing and the timing [93] . luo et al. [94] had speculated that nucleocapsid protein (np) of sars-cov played an important role in the process of virus particle assembly and release and it might also bind to human cyclophilin a.chymotrypsin-like (3c-like) and papain-like protease (plp) are coronavirus encoded protein. they have an essential function for coronaviral replication and also have an additional function for inhibition of host innate immune responses [95] .cinanserin, an old drug, is well-known for serotonin receptor antagonists. it could inhibit the 3 chymotrypsin-like (3c-like) protease and was a promising inhibitor of replication of sars-cov [96] . flavonoids are an important class of natural products and have several subgroups, which include chalcones, flavones, flavonols, and isoflavones [97] . other flavonoids (herbacetin, isobavachalcone, quercetin 3-β-d-glucoside, and helichrysetin) were also found to be able to block the enzymatic activity of mers-cov/3clpro [98] . papain-like protease (plp) of human coronavirus is a novel viral-encoded deubiquitinase and is an ifn antagonist for inhibition of host innate antiviral immune response. diarylheptanoids is a natural product and is extracted from the stem bark of alnus japonica. it was able to inhibit papain-like protease of sars-cov [95] .angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ace2) is a type i integral membrane protein which that functions as a carboxypeptidase and is the first human homolog of ace.besides, ace2 is also a functional receptor of sars-cov and it mediates virus entry into the cell through binding with spike (s) protein [99, 100] . zhang et al. [101] reported that covid-19 used ace2 as a sole receptor for the entry, but did not use other coronavirus receptors, aminopeptidase n and dipeptidyl peptidase, for the entry.blocking the binding of s protein to ace2 is important for the treatment of sars-cov infection [102] . one recombinant human monoclonal antibody (mab) (single-chain variable region fragments, scfvs 80r) against the s1 domain of s protein of sars-cov from two nonimmune human antibody libraries. the mab could efficiently neutralize sars-cov and inhibit syncytia formation between cells expressing the s protein and those expressing the sars-cov receptor ace2 were found by sui et al. [103] .chloroquine has many interesting biochemical properties including antiviral effects. in addition, it had been used against viral infection [104] . emodin is an anthraquinone compound derived from genus rheum boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of hiv infection. lopinavir (lpv) is usually combined with ritonavir (rtv) to increase and polygonum and it is also a virucidal agent [105] . emodin could significantly block the interaction between the s protein of sars-cov and ace2 [106] .promazine, an anti-psychotic drug, shares a similar structure with emodin. it has been found to exhibit a significant effect in inhibiting the replication of sars-cov [107] . as compared to emodin, promazine exhibited potent inhibition of the binding of s protein to ace2. these findings suggested that emodin and promazine might be able to inhibit sars-cov infectivity by blocking the interaction of s protein and ace2. therefore, the monoclonal antibody (scfv80r), chloroquine, emodin, and promazine could be used as choices for the treatment of covid-19. nicotianamine is an important metal-ligand in plants [108] and it is found a novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 inhibitor in soybean [109] . so, it is another potential option to be used to reduce the infection of covid-19.ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, is routinely used to treat hepatitis c [110] . morgenstern et al. [111] had reported that ribavirin and interferon-β synergistically inhibited the replication of sars-associated coronavirus in animal and human cell lines. given adverse reactions and the lack of in vitro efficacy, the use of ribavirin should be seriously considered for the treatment of covid-19, even in combination with other antiviral drugs. the combination of lopinavir (lpv) with ritonavir (rtv) is widely used as a boosted protease inhibitor in the treatment of hiv infection [112] . kim et al. [113] had also reported a successful case of mers-cov disease treated with triple combination therapy lpv/rtv, ribavirin, and ifn-α2a.remdesivir (rdv), a nucleoside analog gs-5734, had been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus in vitro and to restrain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) in vivo [114] . recently, the antiviral activity of rdv and ifn-β was found to be superior to that of lpv/rtv-ifn-β against mers-cov in vitro and in vivo [115] . therefore, the use of rdv with ifn-β could be a better choice for the treatment of covid-19 comparing with that of the triple combination of lpv/rtv-ifn-β. however, randomized and controlled trials are still needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir. yamamoto et al. [116] had found that nelfinavir could strongly inhibit the replication of sars-cov.arbidol and its derivatives, arbidol mesylate, had been reported to have antiviral activity against the pathogen of sars in the cell cultures and arbidol mesylate was nearly 5 times as effective as arbidol in reducing the reproduction of sars virus in the cultured cells [117] . nitric oxide (no) is a gas with diverse biological activities and is produced from arginine by no synthases [118] . akerström et al. [119] had reported that organic no donor, s-nitroso-n-acetylpenicillamine, could significantly inhibit the replication cycle of sars-cov in a concentration-dependent manner. therefore, no inhalation could be also chosen as an option for the treatment of severely covid-19 infected patients (table 1) .computational methods can be utilized for the design and engineering of drugs [120, 121] . the low time requirements of computational methods are conducive for high throughput screening of available drugs to identify potential drugs for novel diseases as well as to predict the adverse effects of novel drugs [122] . development of novel drugs is a time-consuming process and generally, several years of work are required for clinical approval [121] . drug repositioning, also known as repurposing, is an effective strategy to combat novel diseases caused by infectious agents that spread rapidly [123] . drugs that have been approved for some disease, are safe for human use, and only their effectiveness against the disease of interest needs to be established [124] . in life-threatening cases, where there is no alternative medicine or vaccine, such a drug repurposing strategy is particularly attractive. however, clinical trials are necessary to ensure that such treatment is better than a placebo [125] .lopinavir and ritonavir were identified in earlier studies to target the main protease (mpro) of sars virus. the protein sequences of covid-19 main protease (sars-cov-2 mpro) and sars-cov mpro are 96% identical [126] . in several early studies, the similarities in the sequence of a potential target for covid-19 to that of the sars mpro were utilized to build a model for the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro [126] . homology based models were utilized to screen a library of compounds to predict that nelfinavir, an approved antiviral protease inhibitor, is a potential drug for covid-19 [122] . the sequence similarity of the sars-cov-2 mpro to the sars mpro is sufficiently high to build a good model for the structure of sars-cov-2 mpro [123, 127] . however, the predictions of virtual screening studies and binding energy calculations are generally more accurate if a high-resolution experimental structure of the target is available.the recent availability of the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for covid-19, as well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the mpro was utilized as the target for virtual high throughput screening [120] , indicating that the results confirm earlier preliminary reports based on studies of homologs that some of the drugs approved for the treatment of other viral infections also have the potential for the treatment of covid-19. therefore, approved anti-viral drugs that target proteases were ranked for potential effectiveness against covid-19 and novel candidates for drug repurposing were identified.there is an urgent need for the development of anti-viral drugs and vaccines against the 2019-ncov virus due to the high mortality rate of patients. during the epidemic and pandemic outbreak of new viral pathogens, the conventional method of development of drugs and vaccination is not possible to control as it is a time-consuming process [128, 129] . consequently, the rapid approach based on in-silico informatics has become very popular with recent advances in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases [130] [131] [132] . the continuous increase of patients and a high mortality rate of sars-cov-2 infection highlight the urgent need for the development of a safe and effective vaccine [133] . the aim of this is to use to computational approach to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates. the spike protein in the novel coronavirus sequence is used to design both anti-viral drug and vaccine candidates. for anti-viral drug design, receptor-binding protein of novel coronavirus present in the n-terminal of spike protein is homology modeled and used as a protein receptor [134] . 3c like proteinase (3clpro) plays a role in viral pathogenicity and replication by clevaging the polyprotein. the inhibitors of 3clpro can block the clevage reaction thereby controlling viral replication and pathogenicity [135] . the natural inhibitors were used as ligands and docked with homology modelled coronavirus receptor binding protein [136] . for vaccine design, the full sequence of the spike protein of novel coronavirus is used to predict b-cell and t-cell epitopes. the select best t-cell epitopes based on antigenicity used as peptides and docked with human allele protein.the computational approach is proposed for drug and vaccine design [120] . to explore suitable natural inhibitors for the n-terminal receptor-binding domain of spike protein, the spike protein sequences were collected from a protein database. and also they were analyzed with various bioinformatics tools, attempting to identify suitable vaccine candidates by identifying b-cell and t-cell epitopes [137] . in the drug design, the tanshinone iia and methyl tanshinonate were identified as natural inhibitors based on the docking score [138] . in the vaccine design, b-cell epitope vllplvssqcvnlttrtqlppaytn was found to have the highest antigenicity.fvflvllpl of mhc class-i allele and fvflvllpl of mhc class-ii allele were identified as best peptides based on several alleles and antigenicity scores [139] .therefore, identifies natural inhibitors and putative antigenic epitopes might be useful as effective drug and vaccine candidates for the eradication of novel coronavirus.structural proteins are important targets for vaccine and anti-viral drug development due to their indispensable function to fuse and enter into the host cell [140] .sars-cov-2 utilizes glycosylated spike (s) protein to gain entry into host cells. the s protein is a trimeric class i fusion protein and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane [141, 142] . the s protein includes the receptor binding s1-subunit and the membrane fusion s2-subunit. the s1 subunit receptor-binding domain (rdb) is specifically recognized by the host receptor. when the s1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor, the prefusion trimer is destabilized, resulting in the shedding of the s1 subunit, and the state transition of the s2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation [143] . the critical function of the s protein can be a breakthrough in vaccine design and development.great efforts are being made for the discovery of antiviral drugs, but there are no licensed therapeutic or vaccine for the treatment of sars-cov-2 infection available in the market. developing an effective treatment for sars-cov-2 is, therefore, a research priority. it is time-consuming and expensive to design novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies [144] . thus, choosing the method of immune-informatics is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens, b-and t-cell linear epitope prediction, and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens. among those can be analyzed, b-cell can recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection, t-cell and antibody reactions may recover extreme respiratory infection (fig. 2) .the immune-informatics approaches to identify b-and t-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (s) of sars-cov-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (hla) alleles was taken by li et al. [145] . four b cell epitopes, two mhc class-i and nine mhc class-ii binding t-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features were identified. allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. the stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. no mutations were observed in all the selected b-and t-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development, as described by li et al. [145] .as noted before, covid-19 has become a global concern, due to widespread outbreaks and lack of treatment. therefore, it is necessary to find and evaluate treatment methods more quickly in this case computer methods are very effective and helpful. the predicted binding and ranking of drugs will also be useful to interpret the results of ongoing clinical trials that are testing existing drugs for effectiveness against covid-19. notwithstanding the limitations, it has been described several diseases and traits which may be causally related to ace2 expression the lung, which in turn may mediate susceptibility to sars-cov-2 infection. in addition, the proteome-wide mr analysis revealed proteins that could lead to changes in ace2 expression. subsequent drug repositioning analysis highlighted several candidates that may warrant further investigations. we stress that most of the findings require replications and validation in further studies, especially the part on drug repositioning. nevertheless, it is believed that this work is of value given the urgency to address the outbreak of sars-cov-2.this study was supported by tabriz university of medical sciences with grant number 65174.none to declare increase of viscosity in hypercoagulable states (lew, kwek et al. 2003) thymosin α 1 sars cov increase resistance to glucocorticoid induced death (baumann, badamchian et al. 1997) thymopentin hepatitis b restore antibody production (duchateau, servais et al. 1985) levamisole sars cov immunostimulant agent or immunosuppressive agent (joffe, sukha et al. 1983) cyclosporine a sars cov, avian infectious bronchitis virus treatment of autoimmune disorders (luo, luo et al. 2004) coronavirus specific treatments coronavirus protease inhibitors chymotrypsin like (3c like) inhibitors cinanserin sars cov serotonin receptor antagonist (chen, gui et al. 2005) flavonoids sars cov/mers cov antioxidant effects /antiviral abilities (diwan, ninawe et al. 2017) papain like protease (plp) inhibitors diarylheptanoids sars cov anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor (park, jeong et al. 2012) spike (s) protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) blockers human monoclonal antibody sars cov treatment of many solid tumors (sui, li et al. 2004) chloroquine sars cov prevention of malaria in adults (savarino, boelaert et al. 2003) emodin sars cov pancreatic disease, inflammatory, and diabetes (vickers 2017) promazine sars cov using in paranoid and manic-depressive conditions, (cauwenberghs, feijge et al. 2006) coronavirus disease covid-19 outbreak began in late december 2019 in wuhan, the capital of hubei province, china . scientists from all over the world are attempting to investigate this novel virus, known as 2019-ncov, which is highly contagious, and to discover effective interventions to control and prevent the disease (heymann, 2020; huang et al., 2020) . coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded rna viruses (ssrna þ ) belonging to the coronaviridae family. human coronaviruses hcov-229e, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, and hcov-hku1 are observed in almost one-third of the common cold (lim et al., 2016) . however, recently some cases of human coronavirus infections have led to fatal endemics, including sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), mers (middle east respiratory syndrome) and covid-19 that are common diseases between humans and animals whose belong to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family (al-tawfiq et al., 2014) . so far, the novel covid-19 has caused more than 700,000 illnesses and more than 33,000 deaths worldwide (w.h.o., 2020) . the genome size of this virus is about 30 kb and encodes structural and non-structural proteins like other coronaviruses. structural proteins include s protein (spike), e protein (envelope), m protein (membrane), and n protein (nucleocapsid) (ahmed et al., 2020) . the increasing rate of covid-19 disease and the high morbidity necessitate the development of a specific and safe vaccine candidate as soon as possible. there is very little known actually about the pathogenesis of the virus; therefore, an immunoinformatics-based approach to investigate the immunogenic epitopes and vaccine design using data from proteins sequencing of the covid-19 is required.n protein is the only structural protein that associates with replicase-transcriptase complexes and binds with genomic rna in coronaviruses (cong et al., 2017) . this protein is multifunctional and one of the most crucial structural components of coronaviruses. n protein is a structural and antigenic protein that is involved in packaging, transcription, and replication coronaviruses (4). this data showed that n protein is a suitable candidate for targeting drug and vaccine design because this protein is conserved, antigenic and multifunctional (6). leung and et al. concluded that n protein can be a suitable vaccine candidate against sars-cov because induce strong antibody and this process may trigger cytokine production (leung et al., 2004) . coronaviruses m protein also has a key role in the assembly of virions. the sars-cov m protein can interact with n protein and make a network of interactions with the genomic rna (he et al., 2004) . ong and et al. the covid-19 antigens such as s, n and m proteins introduced as a vaccine candidate (6). this protein has also been studied as an epitope vaccine candidate against sars-cov (7).open reading frame 3a (orf3a) is required for viral replication and virulence of sars cov. severe induction of proinflammatory cytokine is a sign of sars-cov and mers-cov infections. orf3a activates both pro-il-1b gene expression and il-1b secretion and leads to severe lung injury. (siu et al., 2019) . also, orf3a has an important role in sars-cov assembly or budding with the participation of m and e proteins (mcbride & fielding, 2012) . these proteins are not only involved in the pathogenesis of the covid-19 virus but also have high antigenicity (chan et al., 2020; siu et al., 2019; xu et al., 2020) . in this study e, m, n, orf10, orf8, orf3a and m proteins were evaluated by available bioinformatics tools for designing an efficient multi-epitope vaccine for the stimulation of immune responses against covid-19 infection.since the covid-19 has been recently discovered, little immunological information is available. preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the covid-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the sars-cov (79.7% identify) (9, 14) . given the apparent similarity between the two viruses, it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against sars-cov may be useful for developing a vaccine for covid-19. previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus (deming et al., 2007; yang et al., 2004) . studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the n protein of sars-cov, an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection, is relatively common in patients infected with this virus (liu et al., 2004; lin et al., 2003) . although these antibodies are effective, they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients. in addition to the specific humoral immunity, it has been shown that the cd 4þ and cd 8þ responses provide long-lasting protection against covid-19. these studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response, cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections (liu et al., 2017) . the concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble b and t-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses. peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production, chemical stability, and lack of infectious potential (patronov & doytchinova, 2013) . the experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years. these vaccines are mainly made up of b-cell, cd 8þ cytolytic t-cell (ctls) and cd 4þ helper t-cells (htls) epitopes (chiarella et al., 2009) . since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected, therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response (testa & philip, 2012; zheng et al., 2017) . during the development of a vaccine candidate against covid-19, complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation.in the present study, we aimed to design a novel multiepitope fusion protein (nucleocapsid, orf3a, and membrane protein or nom) containing more efficient antigenic epitopes-rich domains. the biological activity of the engineered fusion protein was assessed by bioinformatics tools using the interaction between the vaccine candidate and the innate immune system receptor (tlr4) and cellular immune system receptor (hla-a ã 11:01). we strongly believe that the outcome of the present report will provide a potential vaccine candidate against 2019-ncov.in this study, we designed a suitable vaccine candidate against covid-19, by exploiting the programs of reverse vaccinology ( figure 1) at first, the amino acid sequences of proteins were retrieved from the national centre for biotechnology information (ncbi) at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov in fasta format and performed for subsequent analysis (table 1 ).we selected six proteins of covid-19 virus ( table 1) that have an essential role in virulence and replication of the virus, and previous studies have highlighted the necessity of these proteins in coronaviruses function. after the antigenic analysis of these proteins, three proteins of n, orf3a, and m were selected for final analysis.1d sequence-based screening server rankpep was used to identify t-cell epitopes (reche & reinherz, 2007) . this server predicts peptide binders to mhc molecules from protein sequences using the position-specific scoring matrix (pssm). we have selected all hla class i alleles from the selection panel of rankpep server for prediction of epitopes of hla class i. to prediction of epitopes of hla class ii, we considered drb1 ã 0101, drb1 ã 0301, drb1 ã 0401, drb1 ã 0701, drb1 ã 0801, drb1 ã 1101, drb1 ã 1301, and drb1 ã 1501 that cover hla variability of over 95% of the human population worldwide (kruiswijk et al., 2020) .for the prediction of b-cell epitopes, the amino acid sequence was analyzed using bepipred and kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity (http://www.iedb.org/) servers (vita et al., 2019) . bepipred for linear epitope prediction uses both hidden markov model and amino acid propensity scales methods. kolaskar and tongaonkar evaluate the protein for b cell epitopes using the physicochemical properties of the amino acids and their frequencies of occurrence in recognized b cell epitopes (kolaskar & tongaonkar, 1990; mirza et al., 2016) .according to the prediction results of the servers used, b cell epitopes and hla class i and ii epitopes that have had high scores were extracted and combined to generate multi- antigenicity of designed recombinant protein predicted using the vaxijen v2.0 server. the vaxijen classified antigens based on auto cross-covariance (acc) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties which is a novel alignment-independent method and overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent sequence methods (doytchinova & flower, 2007) . the prediction of vaccine candidate allergenicity is essential. the allergenicity of the designed protein was computed by allertop (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/). allertop method predicts recombinant protein allergenicity on auto crosscovariance acc that describe residue hydrophobicity, size, abundance, helix-and b-strand forming propensities (dimitrov et al., 2013) . allertop v.2 has the highest accuracy (88.7%) compared to several servers for allergen prediction (dimitrov et al., 2013) .the analyzed parameters consisted of the molecular weight, theoretical pi, amino acid composition, atomic composition, extinction coefficient, estimated half-life, instability index, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity that were evaluated by protparam online server (http://us.expasy.org/ tools/ protparam.html) (gasteiger et al., 2005) .gor was used for the designed protein secondary structure prediction (https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat. pl?page=/npsa/npsa_gor4.html) (kloczkowski et al., 2002) . gor4 predict protein secondary structure using information theory.the tertiary structure was built using the galaxy web. galaxyweb server (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/ tbm) is based on the tbm method. this server detects similar proteins and alignment with the target sequence, then make the model and finally perform model refinement (shin et al., 2014 ).the best-modeled structure was refined using the galaxy refine server at (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?-type=refine). galaxy refined the model by molecular dynamics simulation. this method showed one of the best performances in improving protein structure quality. analysis of the final 3 d model was made using molprobity, prosa and ramachandran plot. ramachandran plot obtained from rampage calculates torsional angles residue-by-residue in protein and indicates that residues are in allowed, favored or outlier regions (oberholser, 2010) . prosa web used to recognize the errors in the generated 3 d models using atomic coordinates of the model. prosa web was created z-score (overall model quality) and a plot of residue energies of proteins (wiederstein & sippl, 2007) . clash analysis is very important for the validation of proteins. molprobity is a structure-validation web service that calculates the clash score, protein-geometry score, poor rotamers, ramachandran plot, and molprobity score.the interaction between antigen epitopes and antibodies is very essential to eliminate the infection. conformational epitopes are the most important and the most prevalent epitopes that are recognized by antibodies. all conformational epitope prediction methods require the 3 d structures of proteins. discontinuous epitopes of recombinant protein predicted using the ellipro server. this web-based predicts discontinuous epitopes based on protein-antibody interactions. ellipro server predicts conformational and linear b cell epitopes using thornton's method and by modeller program or blast search of pdb predict and visualize of antibody epitopes (ponomarenko et al., 2008) .the crystallographic structures of tlr4 (pdb id: 2z62 (kim et al., 2007) ) and hla-a ã 11:01 (pdb id: 5wjl (culshaw et al., 2017) ) were obtained from the pdb database (berman et al., 2000) . the structures were cleaned and crystallographic waters and co-crystallized molecules were deleted and only the monomer forms of each receptor were kept. then, the structures of the two receptors and the nom protein were prepared by the dock prep tool in ucsf chimera software (pettersen et al., 2004) where hydrogen atoms and charge were added to the structures to make them ready for the next step. in the next step, to stabilize and relax the structures in an aqueous physiological environment, each of the monomer form of the receptors and the nom protein were simulated for 100 ns. the details of the md simulation will be explained later.after the md simulation of each receptor and the nom recombinant protein, the last frame of the trajectory of each simulation was extracted and used as the input structures for protein-protein molecular docking. the patchdock webserver (schneidman-duhovny et al., 2005) with default parameters was used to predict the best positions and orientations where the two proteins can have the highest number of favorable interactions. afterward, the top 10 solutions were subjected to firedock webserver (andrusier et al., 2007; mashiach et al., 2008) to refine the interaction of protein-protein complexes resulted from molecular docking. the top two complexes from coronavirus nom protein-tlr4 and nom recombinant protein-hla-a ã 11:01 complexes were chosen based on global energies. these four complexes were then taken to the next step, md simulation.after performing the protein-protein molecular docking and finding the best orientations of the vaccine candidate and the receptor proteins to interact with one another, the two best-scored complexes were subjected to md simulation. all of the md simulations were done by gromacs 2018 package (abraham et al., 2015) and opls-aa force field (jorgensen et al., 1996) . the monomer form of each protein and also the docked complexes were placed in the center of a triclinic box with a distance of 1 nm from all edges and solvated with tip3p water model (jorgensen et al., 1983) . then, sodium and chloride ions were added to produce a neutral physiological salt concentration of 150 mm. each system was energy minimized, using the steepest descent algorithm, until the fmax was found to be smaller than 10 kj.mol à1 nm à1 . all of the covalent bonds were constrained using the linear constraint solver (lincs) algorithm (hess et al., 1997) to maintain constant bond lengths. the longrange electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh ewald (pme) method (darden et al., 1993; essmann et al., 1995) and the cut off radii for coulomb and van der waals short-range interactions were set to 0.9 nm. then 100 ps nvt (constant number of particles (n), volume (v), and temperature (t)) and 300 ps npt (constant number of particles (n), pressure (p), and temperature (t)) equilibrations were performed for each system. after the necessary equilibrations, 100 ns of production run were performed for each of the four complexes. finally, simulations were carried out under the periodic boundary conditions (pbc), set at xyz coordinates to ensure that the atoms had stayed inside the simulation box, and the subsequent analyses were then performed using gromacs utilities, vmd (humphrey et al., 1996) and uscf chimera, and also the plots and the figures were created using daniel's xl toolbox (v 7.3.2) add-in (kraus, 2014) the binding free energies of the protein-protein complexes were calculated by molecular mechanics-poisson-boltzmann solvent-accessible surface area, mmpbsa method (kollman et al., 2000) using g_mmpbsa package (kumari et al., 2014) . in this method, the binding free energy is the result of the free energy of the complex minus the sum of the free energies of the ligand and the protein. in our case, the nom recombinant protein is defined as the ligand and the immune receptors are defined as the receptors. the mmpbsa calculation was done for every ns of each simulation trajectories.the results of several studies have shown that strong virusspecific t-cell response is required for the elimination of respiratory virus infections such as sars-cov and influenza a and para-influenza. these studies conclude that future vaccine interventions should also consider strategies to enhance t cell response to provide robust long-term memory (channappanavar et al., 2014; janice oh et al., 2012) . studies have shown that high levels of t cell responses against n protein were found 2 years after the patient's recovery (peng et al., 2006) . antibodies are essential to combat sars-cov infection, and the body needs sars-cov specific cd4 þ t helper cells to produce these specific antibodies. also, cd8 þ cytotoxic t cells are important for recognizing and killing infected cells, especially in the lungs of infected individuals. we used the rankpep server which covers almost all hla supertypes to predicted different epitops from n, orf3a and m proteins sequence according to hla i and hla ii alleles. antigenic epitopes with high binding affinity score were predicted that are summarized in table 2a-b.successful vaccination against viruses such as measles and rubella reflects the importance of protective antibodies. protection against virus infection such as coronaviruses depends on the simulation of neutralizing antibodies in addition to the t cell-mediated immunity. while cytotoxic lymphocytes can kill infected cells, antibodies have the potential to eliminate infected cells and prevent the infectious virus from infecting a cell (neutralization). sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies block viral entry (d€ orner & radbruch, 2007; hsueh et al., 2004) . in this study, for the linear epitope prediction, the bepipred server was employed. bepipred analysis revealed several continuous predicted epitopes of n, orf3a and m proteins. for cross-checking the predicted epitopes, the sequence of all three proteins was also predicted by kolaskar & tongaonkar antigenicity. the linear bcell epitopes are represented in (table 3 ). given that both cellular and humoral immune responses are essential against coronaviruses infection (janice oh et al., 2012) , finally, epitopes that were shared between b cell and t-cell were selected.the main strategy in the present study was to design and construct a novel multi-epitope protein from covid-19 based on in silico methods to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses. due to the low immunogenicity of the epitope, we chose epitope-rich domains to generate a more diverse and robust response (wieser et al., 2010) . based on in silico analysis, five epitope-rich domains including highly scored and shared epitopes between t and b-cell epitopes were selected and joined to each other with a three aaa linker (table 4 ). the schematic diagram of designed vaccine domains with linker's sites has been shown in figure 2 .prediction of the vaccine candidate antigenicity represents a numerical criterion for the capability of the vaccine to bind to the b-and t-cell receptors and increase the immune response in the host cell. vaxijen v2.0 was used to predict the antigenicity of the designed protein. vaxijen analysis of nom protein showed potent antigenicity 0.5999 with a 0.4% threshold. the results indicate that the designed protein sequences without adjuvant are antigenic. allergen proteins induce an ige antibody response (dimitrov et al., 2013) . the designed vaccine candidate must not show an allergic reaction to the body. the allergenicity of the sequence was predicted using the allertop tool. based on prediction approaches in allertop, this protein was not recognized as an allergen.primary structure analysis nom designed protein (337 aa) has a molecular weight of 37513.57 d. the total number of positively charged residues (arg þ lys) and negatively charged residues (asp þ glu) were 19 and 32 respectively. the theoretical isoelectric point (pi) was calculated at 9.62. the instability index (< 40) indicates that the designed protein has high stability for the initiation of an immunogenic reaction. the instability index (ii) was 35.75 which classifies the protein as stable. the aliphatic index of nom recombinant protein was calculated 97.92 and indicates this protein has stability in several temperatures. natively unfolded protein regions and alpha-helix are important forms of structural antigens that can be arranged in their native structure and thus identified by antibodies that are produced in response to infection. (shey et al., 2019) . the composition of the predicted secondary structure of the nom multi-epitope vaccine candidate was 43.92% (alpha helix), 16.02% (extended strand), and 40.06% (random coil). all this information indicates the designed protein is suitable as a vaccine candidate.three-dimensional structure was modeled by galaxyweb for our designed protein (figure 3a) . this model was used for evaluation and refinement. for validation of the model, prosa-web, ramachandran plot and molprobity were used that compare and analyze the protein structure. the prosa web determined z-score for the best predicted 3 d model (figure 3b ). the z-score of the nom predicted model was -4.42, which is within the range of scores typically found for native proteins of similar size.the ramachandran plot indicates that most of the residues are found in the favored and allowed regions (99.7%) and only 0.3% in the outlier region, this shows that the quality of the designed model is satisfactory. phe 282, asn311, tyr228, lys194, asp223, ser229, ser4, his197, tyr68 residues were observed in the allowed and outlier regions of ramachandran plot (figure 3c ). in molprobity analysis, the all-atom clash score was 9.37, the molprobity score was 2.21. all structural images were created using pymol (the pymol molecular graphics system, version 1.1, schr€ odinger, llc).ellipro server was used for predicting conformational b-cell epitopes from the 3 d structure of nom recombinant protein. discontinuous b-cell epitopes were predicted with scores ranging from0.679 to 0.945. amino acid residues, the number of residues, sequence location as well as their scores have been listed in tables 5. the graphical representation of the discontinuous epitopes has been displayed in figure 4 .a vaccine can interact with different receptors of the immune system. we have docked designed final constructs (nom) with tlr4 and hla-a ã 11:01 receptors. the interaction between these receptors and nom recombinant protein induce different immune responses. to achieve a stable and relaxed state of the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors, a md simulation of 100 ns was performed for each structure. these simulations ensure that the structures are stable enough to be used for protein-protein molecular docking. after 100 ns of the production run, as it is shown in figure 5 , the rmsd (root mean square distance) values of the monomers show that the backbone structure of tlr4 (pdb id: 2z62) is very rigid and stable. the structure of the nom recombinant protein also reached stability after about 25 ns after a considerable structural change. the backbone structure of the hla-a ã 11:01 (pdb id: 5wjl), however, showed big spikes in the rmsd values but all three structures were visually inspected and were considered stable enough for the next step of the project.to find the best orientation for optimal interaction of the nom protein with the immune receptors we decided to use protein-protein molecular docking. we used patchdock webserver which concentrates on recognizing and matching patterns of the surfaces of the proteins to put them in the best possible positions. afterward, the top 10 best solutions were subjected to the firedock webserver to refine the docked structures. the firedock algorithms refine the docked complexes by side-chain rearrangement and soft rigid-body optimization. the ranking of the docked complexes is based on short-range, long-range, attractive and repulsive interaction energies between the residues of the two proteins, which are all summed up in the global energy or the binding energy of the complexes. we considered global energy as the main criterion for choosing the best complexes and chose the two top-scored solutions with the best global energy. as it is shown in table 6 , the solution numbers 5 and 6 from the nom-tlr4 complex and the solution numbers 2 and 3, from nom-hla-a ã 11:01 complex, were chosen for further calculations. the total energy plots of the simulations are shown in figure 6 . the results showed a strong interaction between designed protein amino acids and receptors. the interactions between the binding receptors and the docked nom protein were visualized using the ucsf chimera program. residues of hla-a ã 1101(glu 53 , asn 174 , gly 56 , asn 174 , glu 53 , pro 57 ) participated in the after the protein-protein molecular docking, 4 solutions were chosen for md simulation, solution numbers 2 and 3 from nom protein-hla-a ã 11:01 complex and solution numbers 5 and 6 from nom protein-tlr4 complex. each was simulated for 100 ns. to examine their stability throughout the simulations period, the rmsd values of each protein was analyzed. as it is shown in figure 7 , each protein has different rmsd values and in some of them, the backbone atoms have considerable movements during the simulations. the reason is that the interactions can get optimized and rearranged by introducing water molecules and physiological conditions. the rmsd values of tlr4 in nom protein-tlr4 complexes and the values of hla-a ã 11:01 in nom protein-hla-a ã 11:01 complexes are very stable and the average values do not reach very high values. however, the rmsd values of the nom protein in every complex reach high values which means that the structure of the vaccine has more movements to refine the interactions with the immune receptors. however, the interactions between the nom recombinant protein and the immune receptors are quite strong and mmpbsa binding energy calculations exhibit great binding energies. as it is shown in table 7 , the van der waals and electrostatic energies of the complexes are strong enough to keep the two proteins in contact with each other. moreover, the deviation of each value is very small which means that the interactions are very stable and consistent throughout the simulations. in another word, the higher scale of rmsd values with consistent binding energies only show that the structure of the nom protein is well optimized for interacting with the immune receptors.in addition to the analysis described above, to analyze the fluctuations of the backbone atoms of structures of the proteins, we decided to perform rmsf (root mean square fluctuation) analysis. in this analysis, the average value of fluctuation of each residue during the simulation is plotted, figure  8 . as it is shown in figure 8a , the rmsf values of nom recombinant protein in five simulations indicate that the fluctuation of the monomer form of the vaccine in many regions is considerably more than the complex forms. this is a direct indication that the nom recombinant protein is much more stable when it is in complex with the two immune receptors. furthermore, the rmsf values of the nom recombinant protein in complex with hla-a ã 11:01 are lower compared with that of nom recombinant protein in complex with tlr4. also, with the evidence that the binding energies are also lower, we can conclude that nom recombinant protein can bind to the hla-a ã 11:01 better than the other immune receptor.in figure 8b and figure 8c , the rmsf values of the monomer forms of the immune receptors show lower values compared to the complex forms. this behavior is exactly the opposite of the nom designed protein. this can be an indication that the structures are very stable in their natural function and their structures considerably change when they get into contact with the designed nom protein. furthermore, the structural illustration of the monomer forms and also the complex forms of the vaccine and the immune receptors, figure 9 , shows that the vaccine can fill the cavities and bind tightly to them, as it was proved by the binding energies.covid-19 pandemic is much more than a health crisis. it leads to a political, social and economic crisis in the world. the development of a safe and effective vaccine could reduce the rate of this infection. immunoinformatics methods are valuable in reducing time and cost in vaccine design and other fields of life sciences. we have predicted and validated nom recombinant protein against hla-a ã 11:01 and tlr4 receptors. our evaluation was based on vaccine candidate structural analysis and molecular docking and md simulations study. the nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a ã 11:01 complexes were very stable in their natural function with strong molecular interactions in around 100 ns. higher binding energy even after the md simulation of 100 ns confirmed the stability and specificity nom-tlr4 and nom-hla-a ã 11:01 interaction. our vaccine candidate can stimulate both cellular and humoral immunity, given that b and t-cell epitopes have been selected in the final construct. taken all together, according to physicochemical evaluations as well as structural and immunological analyses, nom recombinant protein could be considered as a possible vaccine candidate against covid-19.by who 2 . vaccine formulations that can be used to protect against high mortality covid-19 are also currently in the research phase and there are 4 different strategies studied in the clinical stage (those in phases 1 and 2); i) inactivated or attenuated virus vaccines, a classic method used for viral vaccines (amanat and krammer, 2020; chen et al., 2020) , ii) nucleic acid vaccines (dna and rna) prepared using the nucleic acid information obtained by rapid sequencing of the entire genome of the virus (mrna vaccine is the first vaccine to enter clinical phase1 safety trials) saif, 2020) , iii) subunit vaccines in which recombinant protein-based vaccines (s protein is the first and main target) are obtained using antigenic proteins of the virus using recombinant dna technologies and peptide-based vaccines are produced from the epitopes of antigenic proteins of virus (lu, 2020; saif, 2020) , iv) viralvector-based vaccines (an alternative option using only s-1 region or receptor binding domain (rbd) to get rid of the problems caused by using all spike protein) (ahmed et al., 2020; amanat and krammer, 2020; ma et al., 2020) .although epitope-based peptide vaccines are known with their lower immunogenicities compared with other vaccine types which can be increased by utilization of adjuvants, they have become an important subunit vaccine alternative owing to their versatility, low production costs, lower allergenic and reactogenic responses. therefore, developing an epitope-based peptide vaccine against sars-cov-2 along with other vaccine alternatives is of great importance. in this review, while the stages of detection, development, production, and biological evaluation of peptides that can be used in vaccine formulations against covid-19 will be explained in detail, the difficulties experienced in the development of epitope-based peptide vaccines, and the advantages and disadvantages of these vaccines will also be discussed.the development of vaccine against sars-cov-2 is one of the most important strategies to prevent covid-19 and control the outbreak. today, various biotechnology companies/universities are putting great efforts in vaccine development studies. according to the who data of may 29th, 2020, 10 candidate vaccines based on nonreplicating viral vector, dna, inactivated virus, rna, nonreplicating viral vector, and protein subunit are in clinical evaluation and 121 candidate vaccines based on different technologies are in preclinical evaluation against covid-19.among the on-going preclinical vaccine candidate studies, there are 10 dna, 5 inactivated viruses, 3 live attenuated viruses, 15 (ozkan, 2020; shang et al., 2020) . however, it has been stated that the most important features expected in the developed vaccine candidate are long-term protection, antigen-specific cellular immunity, and ability to induce the systemic immune system (ozkan, 2020) .inactivated virus vaccines consist of virus particles produced in culture that have lost the ability to cause disease . the virus is killed by using heat, uv irradiation, or chemicals (formaldehyde etc.) to reduce virulence, so that a vaccine-induced infection can be prevented. large-scale cultures of sars-cov-2 were created and inactivated viruses were obtained from these cultures by researchers via known methods .although inactivated virus vaccines have advantages such as safety, easier preparation, and inducing high-titer neutralizing antibodies, it is an important disadvantage that they are potentially inappropriate for highly immunosuppressed patients (roper and rehm 2009; shang et al., 2020) . additionally, preparing the inactivated virus vaccine requires large quantities of infectious virus (callaway, 2020) . recently, sinovac biotech and their consortium have produced a vaccine candidate from purified inactivated sars-cov-2 viruses. it was shown in the study that specific antibodies against the sars-cov-2 were detected in 3 different animals which had been immunized with the inactivated virus vaccine candidate (gao et al., 2020) .attenuated vaccines are prepared by mutating the virus as a result of a serial treatment with human or animal cells in the laboratory to decrease its ability to cause disease. one of the most important advantages of attenuated vaccines is that they offer more than one antigenic component to the host, so it can induce various immunological effectors against the virus . it has been reported that many research institutions/universities such as the chinese centers for disease control and prevention, wuhan institute of virology, chinese academy of sciences, zhejiang university, codagenix inc., and serum institute of india, ltd. are carrying out attenuated vaccine studies subunit vaccines consisting of purified antigens have the advantages of easy production, safety, and the ability to induce both cellular and humoral immune response (roper and rehm, 2009; shang et al., 2020) . however, subunit vaccines may require adjuvants (immunostimulatory molecules delivered alongside the vaccine) and multiple doses to increase their immunogenicity and protective activity (callaway, 2020) . cov s proteins, which have been shown in studies that have the ability to generate protective antibodies, have been identified as favorite targets in subunit vaccine development against sars-cov (enjuanes et al., 1995; navas-martin and weiss, 2003) . in studies, with similar subunit vaccines, against sars-cov, it is known that experimental animals are protected from infection, although these vaccine candidates have not been tested in humans yet (callaway, 2020) .similarly, in various studies, it has been accepted that s1 protein and/or rbd element of sars-cov-2 should be considered the foremost antigen in vaccine development studies against covid-19 (callaway, 2020; lon et al., 2020; rogers et al., 2020; shang et al., 2020; tang et al., 2020) . many research teams including biotechnology companies, universities, research centers, etc. are working on effective vaccines containing the viral protein subunits against covid-19 (lon et al., 2020; rogers et al., 2020; tang et al., 2020) .viral vector vaccines are prepared by inserting the dna fragment of the highly infected virus into another harmless virus. one of the advantages of this vaccine type is that it can induce high cellular and humoral immune responses (shang et al., 2020) . it has also been reported that while viral vector vaccines can be safe similar to subunit vaccines, the immunogenicity of viral vector vaccines can be highly analogous to live attenuated vaccines (wu, 2020) .university of oxford and the us national institutes of health (nih) collaborators produced an adenovirus expressing the sars-cov-2 s protein (van doremalen et al., 2020) . the study conducted in mice and rhesus macaques showed that this vaccine candidate induced immune response against sars-cov-2. additionally, the vaccine efficiency study showed that the viral load decreased, the lung of vaccinated animals had no signs of virus replication, and no lung damage was observed in vaccinated animals compared to control (van doremalen et al., 2020). 2.5. mrna vaccines mrna vaccines, which have been previously investigated for different diseases and had successful results, are easier to design and translate into clinical trials (ozkan, 2020; roper and rehm, 2009; shang et al., 2020) . although mrna vaccines have advantages such as easier design and inducing strong immune response, it is an important disadvantage that they are extremely unstable under physiological conditions (rauch et al., 2018) . moderna and a consortium consisting of fudan university/ shanghai jiaotong university/bluebird biopharmaceutical company carry out their studies on mrna vaccines against covid-19. while moderna's mrna vaccine encode s protein, the consortium is working on two different mrna vaccines that express s protein and viruslike particles . apart from these, it has been reported in the literature that various companies/ universities and research centers are also working on mrna vaccines .in dna vaccines, antigen or antigens are expressed by the plasmid dnas. the difference from mrna vaccines is the coding of antigens with plasmid dna. although they are more stable than mrna vaccines, are easy to design, and have the ability to form highly neutralized antibodies, it has been reported that repeat doses of dna vaccine may cause toxicity (rauch et al., 2018) .in the study of the usa and israel research teams, dnabased vaccines have been developed to express s protein of sars-cov-2 in different forms (yu et al., 2020) . in the study, both humoral and cellular immune responses have been developed in the animals immunized with the dna vaccine. additionally, the virus challenge study showed that the vaccine encoding full-length s protein decreased the viral load in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa was decreased in comparison with the control group (yu et al., 2020) .as outlined above, traditional vaccines against covid-19 include live/attenuated/inactivated sars-cov-2. however, there are lots of disadvantages to the use of whole-organism vaccine especially in immunosuppressed patients if there is a presence of immunologically redundant biological components or biological impurities (roper and rehm, 2009; shang et al., 2020) . thus, subunit vaccines have become widespread especially in research area due to their safety profiles and easier production. although proteins are the main type of subunit vaccines, peptides, which are small fragments of proteins, are also used as subunit vaccines (callaway, 2020) .epitope-based peptide vaccines are used to overcome the problems of possible side effects related to heterogeneous and multicomponent vaccine and are considered an alternative to conventional vaccines. peptides used in the vaccines are synthesized chemically using the amino acid sequences of the antigenic proteins of targeted pathogens. these vaccines contain antigenic peptide epitopes with 20-30 amino acids having high immunogenicity. the recognition of the antigenic peptides by the immune system triggers the immune response by stimulating cytotoxic t cells or b cells, or both simultaneously (moisa and kolesanova, 2012) . although epitope-based peptide vaccines significantly limit allergenic or reactogenic complications, low molecular weight, and easy clearance from the body make the peptides lower immunogenic which can be overcome by using carriers or adjuvants in peptide vaccine formulations to increase their immunogenicity and decrease the dose (moisa and kolesanova, 2012) .epitope-based peptide vaccines have many advantages over other vaccines. it is easier and cheaper to produce peptides compared to traditional vaccines. epitope-based peptide vaccines can be standardized and batch-to-batch differences can be very low. since the structure of the peptide is very well-known, structure-function relationships can be correlated much easier than the conventional vaccines. also, the structure of the peptide can easily be modified to obtain multiepitope or conjugated structures (moisa and kolesanova 2012; sesardic 1993) .although an epitope-based peptide vaccine formulation basically contains the antigen and the adjuvant, development of the vaccine should follow a pathway to prove its effect and protection against the disease. the first stage is to design the amino acid sequence of antigenic peptide from the proteins of pathogen. although experimental techniques and in silico methods are used together to determine the epitope, in silico methods have become prevalent for prediction of the epitopes due to their time and cost-effective nature compared to experimental techniques (li et al., 2014; sanchez-trincado et al., 2017) . in the second stage, peptide should be produced with high purity based on chemical and biological methods in which chemical synthesis of peptide has been the routine method especially for the peptides having less than 50 amino acids (behrendt et al., 2016 ). an appropriate adjuvant selection is the third stage for mixing or conjugating with the peptide to augment the immune response against the peptide (yang and kim, 2015) . adjuvant used in the epitope-based peptide vaccine can modulate the interactions of peptide with different cells of immune system (guy 2007) . the last stage is the evaluation of vaccine formulation in vitro and in vivo to determine the immune response against the peptide (mozdzanowska et al., 2003) . it is important to comprehend the working mechanism of the vaccine formulation to relate the structure with its interactions with immune system cells. however, in vivo and in vitro evaluation of the epitope-based peptide vaccine gives limited information without the challenge studies against the pathogen (swee et al., 2013) . therefore, if sufficient immune response is obtained from in vivo and in vitro studies, vaccine formulation should be challenged against the pathogen to reveal the protection efficiency before preclinical and clinical studies (swee et al., 2013; zhao et al., 2010) .the immune system is a large network that interacts with each other and contains thousands of molecular networks with the responses it creates (tomar and de, 2010) . genomic sequencing, clinical practice, and large amounts of accumulated data generated by epidemiological data may cause confusion. in order to use this large data more effectively by scientists, it must be stored, managed, and analyzed (bahrami et al., 2019) . this situation has brought immunology and computer sciences together and formed immunoinformatics (pourseif et al., 2019; tomar and de, 2014) .immunoinformatics is a new and important area with a large database that can create the most suitable options before the experimental stage (bahrami et al., 2019) . immunoinformatics includes an in silico approach, which is a more stable and less costly method in a shorter period of time to conventional laboratory techniques for development of vaccines (ali et al., 2017; khan et al., 2019) . the development of vaccines using conventional techniques entails high cost and a long period of 10-15 years (parvizpour et al., 2020) . with this approach, specific regions are designed to prevent unwanted immune responses, long-term immune responses to required responses, and cost-time effectiveness (parvizpour et al., 2020) . the first step in the in silico-approached immunoinformatic epitope-based peptide studies is to identify the virus's antigen that stimulates antibodies and targets that are important for immunity (kibria et al., 2020) . the structural proteins of spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m) and nucleocapsid (n) encoded by sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 genomes belonging to the betacoronavirus genus are suitable candidates for antigen selection (ahmed et al., 2020) . since the b and t cell epitopes, an immunogenic site of an antigen, produce humoral and cellular immune responses, these regions are predicted (parvizpour et al., 2020) .different web-based tools are available for epitope design (bui et al., 2007) . these tools provide user convenience by combining the methods developed for the determination of epitopes. the kolaskar and tongaonkar method is a semiexperimental method that uses the physicochemical properties of amino acids and the experimentally determined data of these amino acids in the b cell epitope design (kolaskar and tongaonkar, 1990) . the bepipred-2.0 server estimates b cell epitopes on only crystal structure derived data, hence providing higher quality and strong prediction power (jespersen et al., 2017) . basically, the methods used in b cell epitope estimation is based on parameters such as the flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity, exposed surfaces, antigenic propensity, and accessibility of peptide chains (vita et al., 2019) . the method used for t cell epitope prediction generally uses mhc class 1 binding, tap transport efficiency, and proteasal processing algorithms (kibria et al., 2020; vita et al., 2019) . t cell epitope prediction approach takes advantage of the cross-reactivity between hla class 2 regions and alleles to predict strong epitopes without being affected by hla polymorphism and ethnicity (grifoni et al., 2020) . then, population-based t epitope estimation is made and distribution of mhc alleles in a defined population is examined. with this estimated population coverage, the percentage of potential individuals who will be immune to the identified t cell epitope is revealed (ahmed et al., 2020) . these epitopes are then transformed into 3d structure and docking analysis performed to show the interaction of the determined epitopes with different hlas (oany et al., 2014) . another stage is the allergenicity test. this step is vital for predicting the allergic reactions that may develop after giving the vaccine into the body (oany et al., 2014) .epitope-based peptide vaccine candidates have been identified in many studies against mers-cov, sars-cov, and sars-cov-2, using all these in silico approaches. although an approved vaccine is not available yet for mers-cov seen for the first time in 2012 (yong et al., 2019) , protein-based studies at the preclinical level are quite high (cho et al., 2018) . in these studies, a large number of possible epitopes have been identified using in silico methods (badawi et al., 2016; ibrahim and kafi, 2020; shi et al., 2015) . similarly, a large number of vaccine development studies using in silico approach have also been conducted for sars-cov (wang et al., 2004; ying et al., 2003) , which emerged in 2003 and spread to 26 countries and with more than 8000 cases. almofti et al. reported that 3 b cell epitopes and 5 t cell epitopes, which gave the best scores, could be very good vaccine candidates determined by in silico-based epitope design study using ncbi and iedb tools (almofti et al., 2018) . vaccine development studies has also been conducted rapidly against sars-cov-2 (le et al., 2020) , as the covid-19 outbreak announced as a pandemic. within the immunoinformatic approach, many studies reported b and t cell epitopes and proposed as potential vaccine candidates for sars-cov-2 ( baruah and bose, 2020; joshi et al., 2020; kiyotani et al., 2020 ). an in silico-based study conducted by kalita et al. identified 33 nontoxic, nonallergenic, thermostable epitopes from 3 proteins (kalita et al., 2020) . the stage of vaccine development studies initiated against covid-19 is given in detail in section 3.3.in the light of all these studies and data, immunoinformatics offers strong candidates that could be used in new vaccine designs (sobolev et al., 2005) . many different databases and pieces of software for vaccine design and validation (parvizpour et al., 2020) are now available for prediction of epitope-based peptides fast and accurate with possible strong immunity and minimal side effects (parvizpour et al., 2020) . further in vitro and in vivo tests should be conducted on b and t cell epitopebased peptides predicted by in silico approaches following their synthesis.generally, peptides can be chemically synthesized using two strategies: solution-and solid-phase synthesis (jensen et al., 2013) . the most useful and popular strategy is the solid-phase method named as merrifield solid-phase peptide synthesis (spps) developed by r. b. merrifield (merrifield, 1963) .there are two main types of solid-phase peptide synthesis derived from the name of the n-terminal protecting groups of the amino acids that determine the chemistry method to be used: boc and fmoc chemistry. since removing the boc protecting group requires working with very strong acids such as hydrogen fluoride (hf), the fmoc chemistry is preferred. spps with fmoc chemistry can be performed under less extreme conditions than boc chemistry, and removing of the side protecting groups, and cleaving of the peptide from the resin (solid-phase) can occur (chan and white, 1999) . here the resin consisting of cross-linked polymeric beads has swelling property in solvents such as dmf and dcm and contains various linker groups on it that binds amino acids. the c-terminal amino acid of the peptide binds to these resin beads. the peptide is constructed with stepwise addition of amino acids at the n-terminus. at the end of the synthesis, the peptide is cleaved from the resin as the side chain protecting groups of amino acids are removed simultaneously (stawikowski and fields, 2012) .the peptide needs to be characterized after its synthesis. lc-esi-ms, maldi-tof-ms, and q-tof-ms methods are used extensively for molecular weight determination of the synthesized peptide. lc-esi-ms and q-tof-ms systems are frequently used in routine as they also allow method validation, determination of purity, and method development for the purification procedure . while ft-ir spectroscopy is used to determine the functional group characteristics of the peptide, two-and three-dimensional structure of the peptide is illuminated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. in addition, measurement methods such as uv-vis fluorescence spectrometry are also used for further characterization .the peptide should then be separated from the impurities by proper purification techniques. the reversed phase preparative hplc is the mostly used technique for purification of peptides. ion exchange and affinity chromatography can also be used during purification of the special peptides after production .for the vaccine against covid-19, the studies in which antigenic peptides are chemically synthesized, and/or designed with in silico methods and showing possible antigenic activities are detailed below.peptide epitope-based vaccine development studies are focused on s protein. studies for the determination of the right peptide sequence for a vaccine against covid-19 are based on in silico studies, synthesis, and isolation of antigenic peptides. in this part of the review, information is given about peptide sequences that can be used against sars-cov-2.in a study by fast et al., it was revealed that t cell and b cell epitopes identified in the study can be used in vaccine formulations against sars-cov-2 with higher immune responses and in detection of neutralizing antibodies (fast and chen, 2020) . the study reported that the 494-506 sequence (sygfqptngvgyq) of s protein has the highest mhc presentation and is a b cell epitope. it is stated that the data obtained from the study is important for identifying strong epitope-based vaccine candidates, as well as its interaction with clinical results will provide information about the relationship between antigen presentation scores and vaccine efficacy (fast and chen, 2020) .bojin et al. identified a multi-epitope peptide vaccine candidate against sars-cov-2, which could have the potential to stimulate t cell immune responses (bojin et al., 2020) . short epitopes with the capacity to bind to multiple hla alleles were selected. mhc class-i and mhc class-ii restricted epitopes were attached with a cathepsin-sensitive linker peptide (llsvgg). a long synthetic peptide sequence has been identified as syfiasfrlfartrsllsvggylqprtfll [a*0201 allele (mhc-i epitop)-cathepsin-sensitive linker-drb1*1101 allele to be used in vaccine candidates (mhc-ii epitop)] (bojin et al., 2020) .in a study by li et al. interactions of sars-cov-2 with b-and t-cell epitopes and human hla alleles for surface glycoprotein were studied . it was indicated that the vgyqpyrvvvlsfel (mhc-ii epitope) peptide sequence had the highest antigenicity score.in another investigation that examined antigenic peptide sequences of sars-cov-2 with multiple epitope structure, proteins of s, e, and m were studied (feng et al., 2020) . while 25 sequences of s protein are recommended, 2 sequences have been determined for m and e proteins. of all these peptide sequences, the 1216-1245 sequence (iwlgfiagliaivmvtimlckkkkkkkkk) of s protein gave higher hla scores than others and was proposed as a candidate antigen for use in vaccine formulations (feng et al., 2020) .zhang et al. have prepared sbp1 peptide-based linker with 23 amino acids using molecular dynamic (md) simulations in their study . the human protein derivative sbp1 sequence is completely proteinogenic and is not considered to have an immunogenic effect. it is seen that s protein is targeted in most of the drug and vaccine development studies against sars-cov-2. the s protein consists of two subunits, s1 and s2. the s1 has an rbd that interacts with the receptor of host cell, ace2. this peptide linker is thought to inhibit the interaction between s protein of sars-cov-2 and ace2, prevent virus entry into human cells, and play an important role in diagnosis and treatment of sars-cov-2 . pant et al. have published a study providing comprehensive research of main residues and ligandreceptor interactions for the improvement of peptidelike molecules as covid-19 essential protease inhibitors (pant et al., 2020) . they reported that four small molecules selected from 300 peptide-like molecules found in various databases, with docking studies and md simulations, show powerful binding affinity with residues within the binding position and should be evaluated against sars-cov-2 (pant et al., 2020) .in one study, the authors presented in silico description of an exhaustive list of antigenic peptides that could potentially be used to develop vaccines against the new coronavirus 2019 (lee and koohy, 2020) . they conducted de novo investigation of peptides with 9 amino acids from sars-cov-2 binding to hla alleles in the european and chinese populations. also, the peptides had tcr recognition potential determined by the immunogenicity algorithm of ipred developed recently (lee and koohy, 2020) .the itlcftlkr epitope was chosen depending on its good antigenicity to prepare and design a vaccine against covid-19 (joshi et al., 2020) . it was reported that this particular epitope can actively bind to mhc hla-alleles and covers the maximum population for various geographic districts. however, it was indicated that the use of this particular peptide epitope in the design of vaccines against sars-cov-2 requires wet laboratory validation.peptides having more than one epitope can be designed and used in the vaccines targeting the s protein. in a study conducted by bhattacharya et al., thirty-three linear b cell epitopes have been determined from the s glycoprotein of sars-cov-2 (bhattacharya et al., 2020) . the sequences were then analyzed to determine the t cell epitope that can be combined with mhc-i and ii. the selected 16 epitopes were transformed into a single sequence with (eaaak)3 linkers. then, the peptide-based vaccine composition was designed and the model was confirmed to be of good quality. molecular docking between the designed multiepitope peptide and tlr-5 exhibited a significant binding affinity. this proves the importance of designing multiepitope peptides to develop effective vaccine candidates against covid-19. these epitopes are ideal candidates for formulating a multiepitope peptide vaccine when in vitro and in vivo validation is performed, owing to their b-cell epitope containing sequences and verified antigenicities (bhattacharya et al., 2020) . on the other hand, abdelmageed et al. suggested that it can be generated a strong and long-term immune response against the covid-19 by cd8 t cell to produce an immunogenic peptide vaccine (abdelmageed et al., 2020) . therefore, they studied t cell epitope-based peptide vaccine modeling instead of b cell by targeting e protein. in mhc-i for the peptide vaccine, the following 10 peptide sequences (yvysrvknl, slvkpsfyv, svllflafv, flafvvfll, vllflafvv, rlcayccni, fvseetgtl, ltalrlcay, lvkpsfyvy, and nivnvslvk) were selected as the best candidates with the highest world population coverage (88.5%). for mhc-ii, another 10 peptide sequences (kpsfyvysrvknlns, vkpsfyvysrvknln, lvkpsfyvysrvknl, psfyvysrvknlnss, nivnvslvkpsfyvy, llvtlailtalrlca, sfyvysrvknlnssr, lvtlailtalrlcay, vtlailtalrlcayc, and cnivnvslvkpsfyv) were also selected as vaccine candidates according to the world population coverage (99.99%). the research group, which aims to find the protected coding genes necessary for the survival of the virus, suggested that unique genes can be used as a potential drug and vaccine target due to their large mutations that enable the virus to show high resistance to antibiotics. protein e has been identified as the most antigenic gene, and its protection against 7 coronavirus strains has been tested, validated, and multiple sequence alignment was done (msa) (abdelmageed et al., 2020) .as a result of another detailed study conducted with a computer-aided vaccine design (cavd) approach to develop a series of epitope-based peptide vaccine candidates, 4 possible peptides were presented; p e l d s f k e e l d k y f k n h t s p d v d l g d i s g i n (1143-1173), fsqilpdpskpskrsfi (802-818), tmslgaensvaysnns (696-711), and nsnnldskvggnyn (437-450) (biswas et al., 2020) . researchers stated that if the peptide sequences are supported by wet laboratory studies, they may be candidates in developing vaccines against covid-19. grifoni et al., in their study, emphasized that understanding of sars-cov-2 proteins and epitopes recognized through human cd4 + and cd8 + t cells responses are important in developing vaccines because it will allow monitoring, measuring, and understanding immune responses against covid-19 infection (grifoni et al., 1920) . it was stated that this information would assist candidate vaccine modeling and facilitate the assessment of vaccine immunogenicity. using the peptide "megapooller" prescribed by hla class i and ii, the research group detected cd8 + and cd4 + t cells specific to sars-cov-2 in the blood samples of 70-100% of healing covid-19 patients. according to the results, 15-mer peptides were synthesized to investigate spike-specific cd4 + t cells. using multiple experimental approaches, cd4 + and cd8 + t cell and antibody responses specific to sars-cov-2 were observed through all covid-19 cases. besides, sars-cov-2-cross-reactive t cell responses were observed in healthy donors, demonstrating some potential for preexisting immunity in the human population (grifoni et al., 1920) .peptides have lower immunogenicity compared to conventional attenuated or inactivated vaccines due to their low molecular weight and size, susceptibility to degradation and lack of all antigenic sites available in the pathogen. therefore, additional molecules called adjuvants should be used in the peptide vaccines to increase the immune response. adjuvants are used especially in subunit vaccines to enhance and modulate the immune response against the antigen, and delivery and presentation of the antigen to antigen presenting cells (apc) (khong and overwijk, 2016) . among several immunological roles of adjuvants in vaccine formulations (powell et al., 2015) , increasing the antibody titer, decreasing the antigen dose, inducing the potent cell-mediated immunity, and expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokines are the most important properties of adjuvants (khong and overwijk, 2016) .adjuvants used in epitope-based peptide vaccines can be simply classified into two main classes as immunostimulants for increasing the immune response and vehicles for delivery and controlled release of antigens to the immune system (reed et al., 2009) . although various adjuvants can be used in vaccine formulations, adjuvants used or proposed for the peptide and subunit vaccines against sars-cov-2 and related viruses will be discussed to remain within the scope of the review.alum has been the most commonly used adjuvant in vaccines since their discovery in by glenny et al. (1926) and classified in branch of vehicles of adjuvants. in the literature, alum is generally used to name aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate gels as adjuvant. in the study by tseng et al. (2012) , alum was used as the adjuvant in four different vaccine formulations against sars-cov, in which two of them are whole virus vaccines, one of them is recombinant s protein vaccine, and the last one is virus-like particle. these vaccine formulations were examined with and without alum as the adjuvant. as mentioned in the study, almost all formulations protected the mice against the virus but th2-type immunopathology and hypersensitivity was observed in response to the formulations. no direct relationship could be established between alum usage as the adjuvant and hypersensitivity. jaume et al. developed a subunit vaccine formulation against sars-cov using recombinant s protein with and without alum as the adjuvant (kam et al., 2007) . they investigated immunogenicity of the vaccine and antibodydependent enhancement (ade) on hamster in their study, in which viral load in hamsters at 3 days postchallenge decreased by at least four orders of magnitude without signs of enhanced lung pathology. unfortunately, alum cannot induce th1 immune response effectively, which is significant in vaccines against viruses (petrovsky and aguilar, 2004) .in a novel study, aluminum nanoparticles were used as antigen delivery vehicles (adjuvants) to deliver ovalbumin as the model subunit antigen through pulmonary administration which is not suitable for conventional alum . it was shown that aluminum nanoparticles can induce both th1 and th2 responses safely and were effective against air-borne pathogens like mers or sars-cov-2 because of the pulmonary administration of the vaccine formulation.in ongoing studies against sars-cov-2, glaxosmithkline is using the adjuvants of as03 in their cooperative study with clover biotechnology for developing s protein based subunit vaccine (veugelers and zachmann, 2020) . as03 is an oil-in-water emulsion-based and vehicle type adjuvant that contains squalene and alpha-tocopherol (reed et al., 2009) . usage of this adjuvant induces both th1 and th2 cytokine responses and higher antibody titer compared with alum as shown in the vaccine study against hepatitis b (morel et al., 2011) .khurana et al. studied s protein-based vaccines against sars-cov-2 to evaluate induced antibody titers (ravichandran et al., 2020) . they used emulsigen as the adjuvant in their vaccine formulations. emulsigen is another oil-in-water emulsion-based adjuvant system. the study revealed that more antibody titers were obtained against receptor binding domain and s1 protein than the s2 domain.mpla and cpg were used as adjuvants in a liposomal vaccine formulation against sars-cov-2 that contains s protein as the antigen (lixin et al., 2020) . while both cpg and mpla (monophosphoryl lipid a) are immunostimulant type adjuvants, cpg has a nucleic acidbased structure and mpla is a lipid. the adjuvant system in the study induced a humoral and cd8 + and cd4 + t-cell responses against s protein of sars-cov-2.the company of novavax is also developing a subunit vaccine against sars-cov-2 using antigenic proteins of the virus (veugelers and zachmann, 2020) . the company uses their commercial adjuvant of matrix-m™ in the vaccine to increase and modulate the immune response. it is known from previous studies that matrix-m™ is a nanoparticle that is formed from quillaja saponins with cholesterol and phospholipids and preferentially induces th1 immune response against the antigenic molecules (magnusson et al., 2018) . 3.4.6. cpg odn, polyi:c (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) and r848 zhao et al. compared the immune responses obtained from three different adjuvants used in peptide vaccines against sars-cov (zhao et al., 2011) . in the study, cpg odn, polyi:c (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) and r848 were examined as immunostimulant adjuvants. cpg odn had better immune response than the others owing to induction of il-12 by cpg. also, the authors noticed that these three adjuvants not only induce the cellular immune response, but also induce humoral immune response against the virus by using the peptides as the antigens.cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cgamp) was also proposed to be used as adjuvant in sars-cov-2 vaccine in the form of ps-gamp (pulmonary surfactant gamp) . this adjuvant can be a good "universal" mucosal adjuvant to develop a vaccine against a wide range of viruses owing to its broad-spectrum cross protection not only against h1n1 but also against h3n2, h5n1, and h7n9 viruses.matsui et al. examined a different strategy by attaching the synthetic antigenic peptides of sars-cov onto the surface of liposomes to induce immune response against the virus (ohno et al., 2009) . liposomes are a kind of vehicle or delivery type of adjuvants. in the study, one of the formulations of antigenic peptide coated liposomes exhibited protection in viral challenge.there are several on-going subunit vaccine studies that use adjuvants to induce the immune response and, as mentioned, adjuvant type can cause different forms of immune responses against the antigens and pathogen. therefore, it is important to notice that proper adjuvant selection becomes vital especially in sars-cov-2 vaccines to prevent immunopathology and ade.in order to design and develop the appropriate and effective vaccine against sars-cov-2, the pathogenesis of the infection must be known well before the vaccine development study. coronaviruses bind to the cell membrane by using the s protein, which is very spiky shaped, to infect a cell (callaway, 2020; rogers et al., 2020; shang et al., 2020) . similar to sars-cov, the sars-cov-2 binds the ace2 receptor on the cell surface for infection in humans (lon et al., 2020; rogers et al., 2020; tang et al., 2020) . during cov infection in humans, the entry of double chain viral rna occurs inside the double membrane vesicles. antigen-presenting cells (apc) as an antiviral mechanism act in the antigenic peptide presentation in complexes with mhc-i and mhc-ii to cd4 + and cd8 + t cells and one of the most important cells is dendritic cells (dc) .as with any viral infection, dendritic cells (dc) present in the respiratory system play an important role as antigen presenting cells (apc) during sars infection. antigen presentation in sars-cov is importantly done with mhc-i and then mhc-ii and they are also investigated for epitope mapping used generally for vaccine development.in the studies, it has been identified that approximately 405 t cell peptide epitopes have a high affinity against mhc-i and mhc-ii. and also, two different b cell epitopes, which are strong neutralizing, were found for the s protein .cellular immune response occurs in infected cells through t-lymphocytes as a mechanism of adaptive immunity. while t helper cells are active in the general adaptive immune response, tc (cytotoxic t) cells are responsible for the clearance of the virus-infected cells. it has been demonstrated that cd4 + (tnfa, il-2, and ifn) and cd8 + (tnfa, ifnγ) memory t cells can function by replicating the ifnγ-producing t cell. however, in recent reports on sars-cov-2, it was suggested that an effective reduction in the number of cd8 + and cd4 + t cells of pbmcs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) of infected individuals can be obtained, which also can lead to impaired t memory cell formation and progression in the recovered sars-cov-2 patients .the antibody-mediated humoral immune mechanism occurs through the differentiation of b lymphocytes into plasma cells through t helper cells and the production of neutralizing antibodies specific for viral antigen . the relevant virus-specific antibodies produced by b lymphocytes to limit sars-cov-2 infection are effective in preventing the entry of the virus to host cells. thus, the specific antibodies prevent the transmission and recurrence of the infection by providing protection against the disease. sars-cov-2 s proteins have b cell epitopes as receptor binding domains (rbd) to produce neutralizing antibodies. current evidence suggests that the th1-type response is important in controlling sars-cov and this probably also applies to sars-cov-2 .in the literature review, it was found that in cases that result in death after sars-cov-2 infection, th2 increases the pathogenesis of the virus with increased immune response zhou and zhao, 2020) .similarly, it has been concluded in many studies that the triggering of the th1 immune response plays a key role in a suitable vaccine model to be developed against the viral infections (channappanavar et al., 2014; huang et al., 2020; thiel and weber, 2008; zhou and zhao, 2020) .ifnγ mediated antiviral immune responses play a stronger cytokine role for control of sars-cov-2 infections. it has stated that low or delayed induction of ifnγ by the virus causes activation of macrophage and proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. activation of immune system components, cytokines or macrophages, causes vascular leakage as well as disrupting adaptive immune response .in conclusion it is vital to develop a vaccine against covid-19 to prevent the disease and limit the outbreak, which has become a global disaster in 2020. many different strategies are being examined to develop potential vaccines against the disease. among these vaccines, the peptidebased vaccine strategies against sars-cov-2 have been mentioned in this review. epitope-based peptide vaccines ascend among all the vaccines depending on their low costs, easier production and safety. however, there are some challenges to be overcome in developing an epitopebased peptide vaccine against sars-cov-2. although in silico methods can predict the antigenic epitopes with high accuracy, it is probable that cell and animal studies may reveal low immunogenicity of the sequence. therefore, a comprehensive study should be accomplished to predict the antigenic peptide sequence against the pathogen. also, possible mutations in antigenic epitopes should be followed to keep the activity of vaccine formulation in the following batches of production. low immunogenicity of the peptides compared to other vaccine types is the most significant drawback, which is overcome by using adjuvants in formulation. proper selection of the adjuvant is essential in epitope-based peptide

officially termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is the causative agent of the covid-19 disease outbreaks. 1,2 wuhan (china) was the first epicenter of this pandemic, and now with more than 8.3 million reported infections and over 449,099 deaths as of june 17, 2020, it is considered as the worst crisis since world war ii. 3−5 the worldwide impact of this pandemic is frightening, and it might not have reached the pinnacle yet. the human race is also facing a crisis situation due to mandatory quarantines and lockdowns. 6, 7 the world economy is already facing a longlasting dent, and the situation will surely worsen if the viral spread is not controlled. 8, 9 alpha, beta, gamma and delta are the four classes of the coronavirus (cov) family, all featuring a single-stranded positive-sense rna genome. the membrane envelops encapsulating the viral genome are decorated with glycoprotein spike transmembrane proteins. the word "coronavirus" is named for the club-shaped protein spikes on their surface when viewed under a transmission electron microscope (tem). the causative agent behind the covid-19 pandemic belongs to the beta class. 10 the same coronavirus class was responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). 11 fever, dry cough, fatigue, and difficulty in breathing are among the initial symptoms of a sars-cov-2 infected patient. 12 this is the more contagious virus in its class and majorly affects the lower respiratory system initiating viral pneumonia. vital organs including cardiac, liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract (git), and the central nervous system (cns) may also be affected, causing multiple organ complicacies. 13−20 life cycle, pathophysiology, and structure sars-cov-2 has a single-stranded rna genome of approximately 34 kilobases and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. the sars-cov-2 genome is 80% identical to the sars-cov and 96% to the batcov ratg13. 10 the integrity of the sars-cov particle is maintained by four proteins: (i) the s protein (spike glycoprotein) that enables the attachment of the virus to host cells followed by membrane fusion, hence, promoting the entry of sars-cov into the host cells; (ii) the abundant m protein (membrane) that maintains the membrane integrity of the viral particle; (iii) the e protein (envelope) is the smallest protein and plays a structural role and helps in assembly and budding; and (iv) the n protein (nucleocapsid) predominantly binds to the sars-cov rna and supports nucleocapsid formation. 21−27 the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is the key receptor for entry of sars-cov-2 in the cells of the host. cellular proteases [human airway trypsin-like protease and cathepsins and transmembrane protease serine 2 (tmprss2)] control the viral entry mechanism by splitting the spike protein and initiating further penetration mechanisms. 28 at least six open reading frames are present in a typical cov genome that encode for the production of subgenomic rnas, 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), and structural proteins (spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid protein). 29−31 the life cycle of sars-cov-2 explaining the entire pathophysiology mechanism is detailed in (figure 1 , i).coronavirus s proteins promote the entry of the virus into host cells and are the area of focus for various antibodies. the surface s protein (spike glycoprotein) of virions is the site for recognition and membrane fusion. 32−34 the s protein (a trimer) gets cleaved into s1 and s2 subunits. the s1 subunits contain the receptor binding domain (rbd) and are released in post-transfusion conformation. 34−37 s1 directly binds to the peptidase domain (pd) of the ace2, while s2 subunits help in the membrane fusion that is critical for viral infection. 38,39 s2 contains cleavage sites and is sliced by host proteases. 35, 40, 41 ace2 is a dimer of the two units and accommodates the rbd in its peptidase domain. the contact between the ace2 and sars-cov-2 is facilitated by polar interactions. 37, 38, 42 an arch-shaped helix of the peptidase domain of ace2 interacts with the loop region of the rbd of the s protein (figure 1 , ii). the other helix and loops connect the antiparallel strands and coordinate the peptidase domain to the rbd. the amino acid interactions that are observed in rbd of sars-cov-2 and the peptidase domain of ace2 are considered important aspects for the inhibitor design. 43 it was observed that the amino acid gln498 of sars-cov-2 interacts with ace2 at the asp38, tyr41, gln42, leu45, and lys353 amino acids, while leu455 of the virus has interaction with asp30, lys31, and his34. more interactions include the sars-cov-2, phe486 with gln24, leu79, met82, tyr83, and leu472. gln493 showed interaction with ace2 lys31 and his34 and forms an h-bond with glu35. the amino acid asn501 has a similar type of interaction with ace2 lys353, gly354, and asp355, while h-bond interaction is observed with tyr41. 44 the binding affinity of the rbd domain of sars-cov-2 and pd of ace2 is higher when compared to sars-cov. 43 it was reported that in sars-cov-2 the amino acid lys417 showed a salt bridge interaction with asp30 of ace2. the positive charged patch contributed toward the electrostatic potential on the surface of rbd that is added by lys417 in sars-cov-2 and absent in sars-cov. 43, 45, 46 examination of the sars-cov-2 virion architecture using tem reveals a roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic morphology. the virion diameter is observed to have a broad distribution of 80−160 nm and a condensed mass of nucleic acid and nucleocapsid protein underneath a well-defined lipid bilayer envelop. 47 tem also reveals the nail-like shape of the sars-cov-2 spikes with a 7 nm wide head and a 23 nm long body. after the dissociation of the s1 subunit from the s figure 1 . sars-cov-2 structure and pathophysiology. (i) sars-cov-2 life cycle: the viral s protein binds to the ace2 receptor of the host. following the entry, there is the proteolytic cleavage of the virus envelope ensuing in the release of genomic rna in the cytoplasm, and smaller rnas ("subgenomic mrnas") are made. these mrnas are translated to several proteins (s, m, n, etc.) essential for the construction of viral assembly. s, e, and m proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum (er), and nucleoprotein complex formation occurs from the combination of nucleocapsid (n) protein and genomic rna (positive strand). formation of the complete virus particle (proteins and genome rna assembly) occurs in er-golgi apparatus compartment. virus particles are then transported and released via vesicles formation and exocytosis. (ii) ace2-rbd (s protein): a single unit of peptidase domain of human ace2 (red) interacting with the rbd of the s protein (blue), (boxed region represents the amino acid interactions sites).protein, a conformational change was observed in the s2 subunit. this change from a compressed form to a nail-like shape was confirmed by different researchers and is called a postfusion state. a three-dimensional (3d) map and twodimensional projection images of s2 protein at the postfusion state were provided by song et al. with negative staining em. 37 it was also confirmed from biophysical assays and cryo-em structure analysis that sars-cov-2 s protein binds at least 10 times more tightly to ace2 host cell receptors when compared to the spike protein of sars-cov. 39 a virus-infected cell undergoes pyroptosis and generates molecules (including damage-associated molecular patterns, nucleic acids, asc oligomers, and atp) to trigger neighboring epithelial and endothelial cells and macrophages. pro-inflammatory proteins (cytokines and chemokines) released there migrate the t cells, monocytes, and macrophages to the infection site. a loop of pro-inflammatory feedback is started by ifnγ (released by t cells). the healthy immune response following this initial inflammation is comprised of t cell-mediated elimination of the infected cells, neutralizing antibodymediated (produced by b cells) viral inactivation, macrophage-dependent recognition, and clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytosis. however, excessive infiltration of immune cells and the resulting cytokine storm leads to a dysfunctional immune response (i.e., multiorgan damage). antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of the viral infection may occur as a result of non-neutralizing antibody production by b cells. 61 adapted with permission from ref 61. copyright 2020 springer nature.further activating signaling pathways and nuclear translocation of transcription factors [like nuclear factor κb (nf-κb), interferon response factors (irf3 and irf7), and activator protein 1 (ap-1)]. 53, 54 these transcription factors further result in the initiation of tumor necrosis factors (tnf), chemokine-dependent inflammatory responses (through nf-κb and ap-1 stimulated expression), and type-i interferon (ifn-α and β)-dependent antiviral innate immune responses to suppress the viral infection. 55, 56 on the other hand, adaptive immune responses are specific (for the virus or cells infected with the virus) and become noticeable after 1 week of the disease onset. the protective role of humoral (b-cell) immune response is primarily delivered by antibody secretion to neutralize the sars-cov-2 virus after specifically blocking the virus−host interaction. 46, 57 t cell response against viral infection is significant for the direct killing of the infected cells (by cd8 + t cells), whereas cd4 + t cells help in cytokine production and priming of b cells and cd8 + t cells. 58−60 lisa (i) chemical

description of various events happening during sars-cov-2 infection ( figure 2 ). 61 organ systems involved sars-cov-2 primarily affects the respiratory system first and then spreads systemically to the heart, liver, and kidneys, 62 although it is still uncertain whether the viral infection directly results in organ or tissue injury as observed in covid-19 patients. it is important to mention that ace2 is highly expressed in the respiratory tract and other organs and tissues, encompassing the cardiovascular system (cvs), cns, git, and female reproductive systems. 63, 64 in the pulmonary system, there is a high expression of ace2 in lung and bronchial branches cells, and it serves as the primary entry site and binding site for sars-cov-2. 65 this higher ace2 expression makes the alveolar epithelial cells more accessible for sars-cov-2 and is clinically portrayed by the rapid development of pneumonia, advancing to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and multiple organ failure in severe cases. 10 in the cvs, cells (heart, endothelial cells, etc.) are known to show a high expression of ace2, which acts to regulate blood pressure and myocardial contractility. 66 sars-cov-2 binding to ace2 may result in the activation and upregulation of ace2 downstream signal transduction pathways. this includes the activation of the ras-erk-ap-1 pathway, which further may activate the c−c motif chemokine ligand 2 (ccl2), which is a pro-fibrosis factor, resulting in the development of cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. 67 an increase in the levels of myocardial markers, specific (like hs-ctni) and nonspecific (creatine kinase, creatine kinase mb isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase), has been reported in patients and can act as important tools for determining the level of cov-2 progression to the heart as well as other vital organs. 68 in the cns, cov-2 can infect the cns in four different ways: (i) direct infection injury: this involves (a) the blood circulatory pathway: the virus passes through the increased permeability of blood−brain barrier (bbb) due to a cytokine storm; (b) neuronal pathway: sensory nerve endings are the major target for viral infection, which may result in anterograde or retrograde axonal transport by motor kinesins and dyneins. 69 (ii) hypoxia injury: a result of virus infection of lung tissues, exudative inflammation (both in the alveolar and interstitial region), pulmonary edema, and related disorders. an increase in alveolar gas exchange disorders causes hypoxia in the cns, leading to increased anaerobic metabolism in the mitochondria of brain cells. this hypoxia leads to cns hypertension (headaches), edema (drowsiness), swelling of olfactory bulbs (loss of taste) and can cause severe damage to cns. 70 (iii) immune system: the infection of macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes can activate the immune cells in the brain, and the consequent cytokine storm can result in severe brain damage. 71 (iv) ace2: sars-cov-2 interaction with the ace2 expressed in the capillary endothelium may damage the bbb and facilitate the virus entry by attacking the vascular system. 72 git: the high expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in intestinal epithelial cells including each organ (duodenum, small intestine, pancreas, and liver) of the gastrointestinal tract makes these cells and organs potential targets of cov-2. a recent study by xiao f et al. detected viral rna and nucleocapsid protein in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia. 73 reproductive system: ace2 is also highly expressed in reproductive organs, especially in placenta, uterus, and fetal interface of pregnant women, in order to counteract preeclampsia. the presence of ace2 in fetal tissue can also provide target sites for cov-2 binding, causing further morbidity and mortality. 74, 75 therapeutic development and vaccine development therapeutic development. therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to deal with existing and potentially upcoming coronavirus infections are under development. the symptomatic treatment approach is presently followed in the absence of an exclusive antiviral treatment against sars-cov-2. artificial intelligence and other computation tools are currently in use to assist the lengthy process of drug discovery and development against this new pathogen. 76−78 using recently available genetic information and protein structure modeling, several therapeutic strategies based on drug repurposing are projected for the immediate treatment of infected patients. 79−82 target identification to halt the pathogenesis of the viral infection holds the key in this development. viral protease (3clpro and plpro), host cell produced protease (tmprss2), rna polymerase (rdrp), and the interaction site of viral s protein with host receptor ace2 are among the major targets identified for repurposing already existing antiviral molecules and new small molecules under development ( figure 3 ). 83−90 targeting the sars-cov-2 surface s protein using neutralizing antibody (nabs) is another strategy proposed. 46, 94, 95 the close similarity of sars-cov-2 with sars-cov allows for researchers to explore the crossneutralizing activity of nabs developed for sars-cov against sars-cov-2 infection. 96−99 the approach is mostly directed at utilizing currently available genomic information to synthesize immunogenic segments against s protein including its rbd. 96−111 several traditional and advanced lead screening and lab/animal testing methods are considered to speed up this usually slow and challenging process. it is also suggested that a combination of nabs may be required to guarantee prophylaxis. 112 some other targets that are considered for neutralizing antibody development are based on the information allied to the already known sars and mers infections. 38 these targets include il-6/il-6r, cd16, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (itam), toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3), dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin (dc-sign), interferon γ-inducible protein 10 (ip-10/cxcl10), intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (icam-3), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp1). 51, 113, 114 cytokine therapy (comprising of chemokines, interferons, and others) is also proposed owing to its potential to halt viral replication and thus its use in treating sars infections. 114, 115 some examples include recombinant interferon (rsifn-co), recombinant human interferon inf-ω (rhifn-ω), polymer conjugate cysteine variants (metil-29c172s-peg), long-lasting interferon fused with human serum albumin-binding peptide (hsa-ifn), and pegylated ifn-λ1. 116 interferon-α2b treatment in covid-19 patients resulted in the shortened duration of viral shedding, particularly the reduction of markers of acute inflammation such c-reactive protein and il6. 117 targeting the sars-cov-2 viral rna genome using rna interference (rnai) or antisense oligonucleotides is another interesting approach to consider. 118 similarly, it was disclosed that a series of sirnas were revealed to target and impede the expression of sars-cov m, n, and e genes. other sirna targets reported include rna polymerase and replicase regions of coronavirus inhibiting its infection and replication. antisense oligonucleotides and rna aptamers are also reported to target the pseudoknot structure and unwinding of the sars cov rna, respectively. 114 vaccine development. the covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted human lives, and desperate efforts are being employed across the world to develop safe and effective vaccines. the first vaccine candidate has already made it to human clinical trials as a result of fast-tracked development strategies and advanced vaccine technological platforms. 121 similar to what was explained earlier for therapeutic development, the significant genomic match of sars-cov-2 with other coronaviruses is helping the vaccine developers to facilitate designs toward the most promising vaccine candidates. the target strategy for most of the vaccine candidates is to induce nabs against the viral s protein, averting the ace2-mediated host uptake. in the case of sars-cov vaccine development, higher nabs titers and better protection were reported with s protein subunit vaccines when compared to any other target strategy. sars/mers vaccine development research suggests s protein subunits, rbd of the s1 subunit, and s protein/gene as the most preferred target sites. 122−124 but still, knowledge of sars-cov-2 specific antigen(s) for under trial vaccine candidates is limited. the development of covid-19 vaccine candidates is relying on several high-tech platforms including attenuated and inactivated viruses, replicating and nonreplicating viral vectors, dna and mrna, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein-based approaches. some platforms offer key advantages such as viral vectors with their strong immune response, superior protein expression, and prolonged stability, and dna or mrna offers antigen manipulation flexibility, whereas the recombinant protein-based development approach is easier to scale up using existing production capabilities. in table 1 we list some of the most advanced covid-19 vaccine candidates that have recently moved into clinical development. 125, 126 enhancing the immunogenicity using vaccine adjuvants is also under consideration to lower the viable dose and to widen the therapeutic and safety window. 127, 128 compromised immune systems and high risk of disease in the elderly population also demand adjuvant strategies to improve efficacy of vaccines in this age group. 129 some licensed adjuvants developed specifically for covid-19 vaccine are as03 (glaxosmith-kine), mf59 (seqirus), and cpg 1018 (dynavax).role of nanotechnology. the covid-19 crisis also demands an urgent analysis of all the available nanotechnology tools. while nanomedicine strategies are in use for the design of the vaccine carriers, there are not enough other nano- technology approaches being explored to tackle the current outbreak. this manuscript attempts to systematically present the current status of nanotechnology use in therapeutics and vaccine development. therapeutic development and challenges against sars-cov-2 infection are not so different from other infectious diseases as well as oncology research. 130 similarly, the vaccine development holds significant commonalities with strategies explored against previously known sars, mers coronaviruses. 121, 131 hence, it is worth revisiting these closely related therapeutic/vaccine strategies and associated nanotechnology use, and this way our aim is to design "repurposed nanotechnology" to fast-track the current research ( figure 4) .antiviral and biomolecular delivery. nanocarrier-based therapeutics offers several opportunities to address the limitations of current antiviral therapy. some basic challenges such as poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability can be solved by nanocarrier-based antiviral drugs delivery, modifying its pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics properties and resulting in dose reduction, reduced toxicity, and improved drug bioavailability and maintenance of the suppression of viral spread. despite viral suppression in the plasma, another kind of challenge is the presence of subtherapeutic concentrations of an antiviral drug in reserve sites. 132, 133 active targeted nanocarriers offer the opportunity to cross biological barriers and attain therapeutic concentrations in sheltered viral reservoirs. 134 it is further possible to target a specific organ and cellular and intercellular sites involved in the pathophysiology of sars-cov-2 (possibly ace2 expressing cells, domains of viral s protein, cathepsin binding sites, etc.). controlled/sustained drug-releasing nanocarriers are the best solution to mitigate the risk effects of poor patient compliance and viral rebound during the treatment of viral infections. a nanomedicine strategy is thus a powerful tool to transform the antivirals repurposing and improving the covid-19 therapeutic management. 135 the role of nanocarrier technologies is decisive in the development of rnai, nabs, protein, peptide, and other biologicals. 136 an important prerequisite with such drug candidates is the protection against degradation "loss-offunction" in systemic circulation and intracellular delivery. systemic toxicity/immunotoxicity is another big issue, more specifically with protein and peptide-based drugs. nanocarrierbased delivery (including biologic prodrug) ensures improved half-life of the biologicals by preventing premature drug release and degradation, along with evasion of renal and hepatic clearance. 137 engineered nanocarriers offer stealth characteristics to evade immune recognition and better cellular uptake. targeted nanoparticles provide an improved rate of endocytosis which better ensures delivery of a therapeutic nanoparticle dose to the target cell. ability to carry a higher drug load entails the delivery of fewer nanoparticles and is further supported with a controlled drug release within the cells ensuring reduced side effects. 138−143 nanomedicine approach for covid-19 therapeutics (rational selection of drug-nanocarrier combination). a broad range of active moieties including antivirals, biologics, and nucleic acids can be loaded and delivered by nanocarriers. connecting the right therapeutic candidate to the right nanocarrier, aimed for a specific disease condition, is crucial for the commercial success of nanomedicine against the sars-cov-2 virus. this nanomedicine approach needs to deal with reformulating approved as well as under trial drug candidates to improve the "therapeutic index" (ti), predominantly by addressing the limitations associated with the drug molecule and mitigating the conventional toxicity or side effects. therapeutic developments proposed for covid-19 treatment possess a basic similarity with oncology research. hence, the currently available nanomedicine platforms for anticancer therapeutics should be considered in order to nurture this approach. 144, 145 better mechanistic understanding of drugspecific side effects is the "first step" in this development process. the "second step" in this process is to scrutinize and select a very basic nanostrategy to maximize the impact of nanomedicine on the drug's ti. nanodelivery of biologics also requires smart nanocarrier designs embracing strategies like the prodrug approach. 146, 147 a rational development and clinical translation of nanomedicine will require several strategic track developments (fast paced and slower paced ones) tackling the right translational challenge and fostering more nanomedicine research. 148 strategic guidelines proposed for the development of anticancer/antiviral nanomedicines are of high importance, emphasizing the right areas and precise tools to fast-track the covid-19 nanomedicine research. strategy 1. nanocarrier selection to bypass the conventional limitations of a drug candidate. for example, relatively safe antibody-drug conjugates of highly toxic auristatins are approved for the treatment of hematological cancers. a major limitation for use of these conjugates is the very low tolerable drug payloads. in order to solve this problem, polymeric nanoparticles were developed with a high auristatin payload to achieve efficient and safe tumor suppression. 149 similarly, formulating poly(ethylene glycol)poly(lactide)-based nanoparticles loaded with aurora b kinase inhibitor revealed increased efficacy and reduced toxicity as compared to its free form which produced intolerable side effects in phase ii clinical trials. 150 a well-known limitation of nucleic acid (e.g., rnai) drug candidates is their systemic circulation instability and the prerequisite of their intracellular delivery. 151−153 lipid nanoparticles (lnps) carrying sirna are an example of a nanotechnology platform (onpattro) used to prevent this systemic degradation along with the benefit of liver-targeting. 154 lipid-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles, used to deliver a highly hydrophilic and unstable antiviral molecule ml336 (chemical inhibitor of venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), showed enhanced circulation time and biocompatibility of the ml336 in vivo. 155 sago and coworkers reported a high-throughput method (named find) to screen lnps that can bypass liver and deliver functional mrna to cells in vivo. 156 broadly, the relationship between nanoparticle structure and mrna in vivo delivery targets may be elucidated from this study. nanocarriers are used to prevent the systemic immunotoxicity of the protein-based drugs and promote immuno-oncology therapeutics. 157 strategy 2. chemically alter/(re)engineer drugs. drug molecules are altered to improve their compatibility with a particular class or type of nanocarriers, rendering this a more generic approach for drug candidates with similar physicochemical properties. 158, 159 lipid bilayer nanocarriers (liposomes) are preferred nanocarriers for ph gradient-based remote loading of amphiphilic and ionizable drugs. 160 the hydrophobicity of doxorubicin was chemically modified to increase its compatibility with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles. 161 another approach of interest here is the synthesis of "prodrugs" to ensure their compatibility and incorporation within particular nanocarriers along with their controlled and localized release characteristics. anti-hiv prodrugs of antiretroviral (arv) candidate cabotegravir has been synthesized by functionalizing fatty acid esters (with variable carbon lengths), followed by its poloxamer coating to get stable nanocrystal formulations. in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in mice and rhesus macaques revealed significantly improved effectiveness of cabotegravir, showing prolonged drug release and pharmacokinetic parameters. 162 another arv prodrug strategy for highly aqueous-soluble emtricitabine (using bioreversible carbonate and carbamate masking groups) shows sustained prodrug release predicted by in vitro to in vivo extrapolation modeling. 163 wei and co-workers have reported the use of cholesterol-modified hydroxychloroquine (chol-hcq) loaded liposomes that lowered the dose and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine and also inhibited the proliferation of rat lung fibroblasts, thereby, reducing pulmonary fibrosis. this strategy can be adopted to have dual benefits in sar-cov-2 patients, which show viral load and pulmonary fibrosis. 164 using a hydrolyzable ester linkage, an irinotecan (hydrophilic) and chlorambucil (hydrophobic) anticancer drug−drug conjugate has been synthesized. 165 nanoparticles synthesized by self-assembly of this amphiphilic drug−drug conjugate shows prolonged systemic retention, tumor tissue accumulation, and increased cellular uptake. hydrolyzable ester linkers conjugated to docetaxel permitted its effective loading and release from core-cross-linked polymeric micelles to provide a high therapeutic efficacy against breast and ovarian cancer. 166 another similar prodrug "fatty acids conjugated to cabazitaxel" with peg-lipid results in self-assembled nanoparticles showing reduced systemic toxicity and superior anticancer efficacy. 167 strategy 3. nanomedicine for combination drug therapeutics. combination drug therapy is another possibility for treatment of covid-19, offering several advantages such as lower dosages of the individual drugs causing fewer side effects, achieving multiple and complimenting therapeutic targets, and reducing the likelihood of resistance development. several such combinations for novel coronavirus treatment are documented in the who landscape information ( table 2 ). nanocarriers are also intrinsically very useful for the delivery of multiple drugs with different physicochemical properties promising the full potential of combination therapies. 168, 169 the flexibility offered by a variety of nanomaterials and fabrication techniques enables the design of drug combinations loaded in nanocarriers with excellent control in preserving synergistic drug ratios, overlapping pharmacokinetics, and reducing combination allied side-effects. 170 various nanocarrier strategies are described for the co-encapsulation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs ( figure 5 ), achieving the sequential release of two drugs, ratiometric loading and controlled release of three drug candidates, codelivery of rnai/plasmiddna + chemotherapeutics, and codelivery of sirna + micorna. 171−179 a nanosuspension of lnps loaded with three arvs drugs (two hydrophobic: lopinavir and ritonavir and one hydrophilic: tenofovir) has been formulated to overcome the lymph node drug insufficiency of the oral combination of these drugs. this nanoparticle formulation showed long-lasting plasma drug profiles and better lymph node drug levels in the macaques in vivo model. 180 a liposomal nanoformulation (vyxeos) coloaded with a fixed combination of anticancer drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine was recently approved by us-fda to treat acute myeloid leukemia in adults. multidrugloaded (antiretrovirals, latency reactivating agents, and drug abuse antagonist) pegylated-magneto-liposomal nanoformulations have shown in vitro and in vivo bbb transmigration with significant anti-hiv activity in primary cns cells. this multifunctional nanotherapeutic strategy can be applied to target sars-cov-2 that has migrated to the cns. 181 however, drug combination regimens are a standard of care for a wide range of therapeutics, but optimizing their nanoformulations is an uphill task. these optimization challenges include analyzing the interaction between two or more drugs, balancing the antagonism/synergy/toxicity, and controlling the release profile of individual drugs. 182, 183 highthroughput screening methods are required to understand the biological interactions and discover any kind of synergism that is present. in vitro screening methods to determine ideal drug ratios demand an upgrade to mimic the 3d microenvironment of the target human tissue. 184 preclinical animal models are critical to accelerating the clinical translation, but a disparity between the model of disease in animals and human disease is the major reason for the failure of the study. 185 nanomedicine scientists should take advantage of advanced drug development tools, screening technologies, bioinformatics, animal models, etc. to investigate and validate nanoparticle combination therapeutics. vaccine delivery. the apparent similarity of sars-cov-2 with other viruses (mainly sars-cov and mers-cov), along with the previous knowledge of their protective immune responses, is of great help to successfully develop covid-19 vaccine. 121, 131 nanoparticles can be loaded with a wide range of antigenic moieties (by physical entrapment or chemical conjugation), and a correct antigenic display makes it a highly relevant alternate in vaccinology when compared to conventional approaches. 197−199 in addition to safeguarding the native structure of the antigen, nanoparticles also improve the delivery and presentation of antigens to the antigen-presenting cells (apcs). the key advantages of vaccine nanocarriers are their nanosize, since many biological systems such as viruses (including sars-cov-2) and proteins are also nanosized. nanoparticles can be administered by oral and intranasal routes and subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, offering a key advantage by overcoming tissue barriers and targeting key locations such as lymph nodes, penetrate mucosal, and epithelial barriers (airway, nasal, gastrointestinal, etc.). 200−202 previous reports have suggested that both humoral and cellmediated immunity performs a protective role in the sars-cov infection. 203, 204 nanoparticles have shown their ability to target both adaptive (t cells, b cells) and innate immune systems (macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils) at the cellular level. modulating apcs using nanoparticles could be very important, particularly for covid-19 vaccine strategies. 205, 206 the ability of nanoparticles to deliver antigen to dendritic cells (dcs) by enhancing antigen presentation and several other mechanisms can promote t cell immunity. 207 smith et al. explained various nanoparticle-based mechanisms to alter the immune response induction in (figure 6 ). 208 to improve the efficacy and safety of the vaccine approach, a big advantage presented by nanoparticles is their ability to deliver molecular adjuvants, and, in some cases, nanomaterials themselves possess an intrinsic adjuvant property for the loaded antigens. the who reports (dated may 27, 2020) various preclinical stage nanoparticle-based vaccine candidates (table 3) . 126 nanomedicine approach for covid-19 vaccine. overall vaccine history indicates major successes against acute infectious diseases, where naturally developed immunity (majorly by neutralizing antibodies) provides enduring protection in a section of patients. one of the bigger challenges in the covid-19 vaccine research is to identify approaches that stimulate both the t cell and b cell immunity against this virus. another challenge is the necessity of accelerating the development of precise "next-generation" vaccine strategies that may also address specific population subgroups or individuals with compromised immunity. 209 smart strategies to develop nanocarrier-based covid-19 vaccines are equally important and sometimes overlapping when paralleled to nanocarrier-based therapeutics. 121, 210 the nanovaccine strategy also requires a strong focus on the cellular presentation of the selected antigen, along with the selection of appropriate nanocarrier/nanomaterial to induce complimenting immunomodulatory effects. the following section highlights the rational design of nanocarrier-based vaccines with two strategies. strategy 1. antigen-dependent nanocarrier selection. loading antigens inside or on the surface of nanocarriers is dependent on several factors including the antigen's physicochemical characteristics, biological stability, target sites, and required immunogen release rate. physical adsorption of antigens on nanoparticles is based on its surface charge and noncovalent hydrophobic interactions. antigens with an amphoteric nature are most suitable for adsorption or surface immobilization on nanocarriers such as chitosan and dextran sulfate-based polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles (such as aunps), and carbon nanotubes. 211−214 antigen release in such cases is predesigned based on the properties of the biological environment like ph, ionic strength, temperature, etc. encapsulation and matrix entrapment of the antigens within a nanocarrier is another technique used to prevent its biological degradation. poly(lactide-coglycolide) (plga) nanoparticles are ideal for encapsulating antigens and provide controlled or extended biological release. 215 these nanoparticles are effective preclinically in carrying antigens such as hbsag, malaria antigens tetanus toxoid, listeria monocytogenes antigens, and bacillus anthracis spores, generating prolonged cellular and humoral immune response. 216 the mrna-based covid-19 vaccine is already under clinical trial employing lnps as a carrier. naked mrnas are sensitive to the degradation by extracellular rnases, thus formulating its delivery vehicle is essential. 217, 218 further, these mrnas entail their cell-specific receptor recognition and lipid membrane penetration. cytosolic presence of exogeneous mrna then triggers the cellular machinery for its translation into fully functional protein. 219 lnps are virus-sized (80−200 nm) particles synthesized by the self-assembly of an ionizable cationic lipid. 220 they possess the ability to deliver mrna efficiently into the cytoplasm, as demonstrated by several studies. sustained-release kinetics of mrna expression and thus protein translation can be achieved by opting for intramuscular and intradermal routes, providing high antibody titers, and both b cells and t cells immune responses. 138 different nanoparticles of these cationic lipids (such as 1,2dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammoniumpropane (dotap) or dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (dope)) are formulated with subtle modifications (such as cationic lipids + cholesterol nanoparticle, cationic lipids + cholesterol + peg-lnp), where cholesterol is used to increase stability and peg-lipid to increases the formulation half-life. apart from lnps, other mrna nanocarriers include protamine (cationic peptide) nanoliposomes (∼100 nm), peg-lipid functionalized dendrimer nanoparticles (∼200 nm), positively charged oil-inwater (o/w) cationic nanoemulsion (∼120 nm), polyethylenimine nanoparticles (100−300 nm), and cationic polymer (chitosan) nanoparticles (300−600 nm). 221−223 figure 7 , i−v represents the mrna vaccines delivery methods and nanocarriers commonly used. similar to mrna, naked dna also experiences systemic degradation by nucleases and incomplete delivery to specialized immune cells. nanocarriers based on cationic lipids (quite similar to mrna deliver), synthetic and natural polymers, and inorganic particles are proposed for dnabased vaccine formulations. polymeric nanocarriers encapsulating dna prevent biological inactivation and provide controlled release and targeted cell delivery. plga nanocarriers are the most studied polymeric platform for dna vaccine development, showing improved systemic antigen-specific antibody responses. 224, 225 to improve the efficiency of dna loading and systemic protection, functional or composite plga nanoparticles (such as cationic glycol-chitosan + plga, plga+ polyethylenimine (pei)) are explored (figure 7 , vi). 226, 227 other well documented cationic polymer-based nanocarriers for dna vaccine design are chitosan nanoparticles and pei nanoparticles/complexes. use of peg functionalization on nanoparticle surfaces is quite common to introduce stealth characteristics (it renders them undetectable to phagocytes and prevent reticuloendothelial system clearance), prevent nonspecific protein interaction, reduce systemic toxicity, and improve stability. 228, 229 to improve the delivery of mrna/dna across the cell and nucleus membrane, physical technologies such as the gene gun and electroporation are being explored. currently, vaccine development is taking advantage of electroporation technology to induce pores in the cell membrane to insert the dna (figure  7 , vii). 215, 230, 231 surface electroporation dna coated-plga nanoparticles have shown efficient cellular delivery to elicit b cell and t cell response in pigs. 231 the clinical future of such portable electroporation technologies is now apparent in the race of covid-19 vaccine research. 232 an ongoing clinical trial (nct04336410) is using a dna plasmid encoding sars-cov-2 s-protein as a vaccine candidate for intradermally administration using an electroporation device (cellectra 2000).strategy 2. vaccine adjuvant nanoparticles. vaccine adjuvants nanoparticles (vans) are considered to improve the overall efficacy and safety of the generated immune response. particularly in covid-19 pandemic situation, vaccine adjuvants are critical to reducing the required antigen dose (dose-sparing), permitting the production of more units and making it available to larger population. 233 among many preclinical covid-19 vaccine candidates, five protein subunit vaccine candidates are reported using a combination of antigen and adjuvant. nvx-cov2373, a nanoparticle vaccine (recombinant sars-cov-2 glycoprotein based) with an adjuvant (matrix m) is now expected to move into clinical trials soon. hence, it is important to discuss the possible strategies employed by vans in other research studies that could help to improve current covid-19 vaccine designs. informing specific immune cells to mount a protective immune response against a specific antigen is the basic mechanism of vans designed to improve efficacy (by serving as immunity promoting cues, also called as "danger signals"). 234 in the case of a virus, these danger signals are characterized as pamps and damage-associated molecular patterns (damps) derived from the same virus. 235 pamps and damps are recognized by specific receptors called pattern recognition receptors (prrs). an example of such receptors is toll-like receptors which are expressed by immune cells to upregulate robust t and b cell priming by releasing inflammatory cytokines. 236−238 adjuvants improving safety provide a kind of counter-regulatory signal instructing the immune system to develop a tolerance for incoming antigens. vans can either act as a nanocarrier for molecular adjuvants or have an inherent physicochemical property to stimulate pro-or anti-immunity pathway. 211 vans are designed to tackle the limitations related to the conventional delivery of molecular vaccine adjuvants such as rapid bloodstream clearance, systemic distribution, and lack of immune cell targeting as well as lack of antigen-adjuvant colocalization. polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating small molecules are employed for lymphoid organ-specific delivery with controlled exposure. the dose-sparing effect is reported with antigen and cyclic dinucleotide (adjuvant; agonist of inf gene stimulator) coloaded liposomal nanoparticles showing safe and uncompromised immune responses. 239 lymph node targeting of vans is an established strategy to achieve a significantly high-dose-sparing effect, whereas dcs targeting vans may enhance its adjuvanticity. in vivo study results against infectious challenge has shown plga and calcium phosphate nanoparticles co-encapsulating both antigen and adjuvants to improve efficacy by enhancing antigen uptake, apc activation, and higher antibody titers. 240−242 in other studies, co-encapsulation strategy allows the colocalization of antigen and adjuvant in endosomal/phagosomal compartments fostering the activation of dcs and triggers robust crosspresentation and t cell priming. 243, 244 synergized activation of apcs and prolonged antibody response was observed with the codelivery of tlr4 and tlr7 small molecule adjuvants using plga nanoparticles. 245 vans (including plga, aunps) are also employed to codeliver self-antigens or immunoregulatory drugs as adjuvants to induce antigen-specific peripheral tolerance of autoreactive t cells and block any serious autoimmune response. 246−251 nanoparticles because of their intrinsic adjuvanticity (by activating complement system, inducing autophagy and activation of inflammasome) are also considered as vans. 252−258 surface chemistry and hydrophobicity of nanoparticles along with other physicochemical properties are capable of electing these adjuvanticity mechanisms intrinsically. 253, 259, 260 hydroxyl groups dependent compliment system activation followed by cellular immunity enhancement is reported with pluronic-stabilized poly(propylene sulfide) nanoparticles. 259 antigen conjugated alumina nanoparticles have been reported to enhance cellular and humoral immune responses as a result of autophagy induction in dcs, fostering antigen cross-presentation to t cells. 255 gold and plg nanoparticles are reported to activate nalp3 inflammasome in dcs, resulting in improved adjuvanticity similar to an alummediated adjuvanticity mechanism. 261, 262 increased side-chain hydrophobicity of poly(γ-glutamic acid) nanoparticles displayed augmented uptake and dcs activation. 263 similarly, aunp surface hydrophobicity can increase the expression of inflammatory cytokines both in vitro and in vivo. 264 vaccine adjuvants have been used to increase the efficiency and the antibody responses of vaccines in the elderly. they comprise the most vulnerable groups of the population and have the highest case-fatality rate of the covid-19 disease. 265, 266 aging is associated with continuous chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging) and acquired immune system weakening, that is, immune senescence. 267 immune senescence is flagged with a significant decrease of immunoglobulin m, interferon levels, t-cell count, rate of cell division and proliferation, chemotaxis of neutrophils, and phagocytosis. 267, 268 o/w emulsion, immune 129 squalene-based o/w emulsion adjuvants mf59 and as03 have been licensed for influenza vaccines meant for the elderly. 269, 270 a liposome-based adjuvant as01 is another key example of licensed technology developed for the herpes zoster subunit vaccine aiming old age population (70 years or above). 271, 272 addition of adjuvants has shown a decreased risk of pneumonia and influenza in clinical trials and can hence play a significant role in regulating the immune system responses of the elderly, which further can be tuned for covid-19 vaccine progress. 129 the scope of nanotechnology for covid-19 therapeutics and vaccine research is not limited to conventional therapeutic and vaccine designs. several other approaches including advanced nanomaterial and biomimetic approaches represent good potential usage in a covid-19-like outbreak. szunerits and co-workers investigated the prospect of functionalized carbon quantum dots (cqds) to inhibit the human coronavirus (hcov-229e) infection (figure 8 , i−iii). 273 cqds of different sizes (<10 nm), surface potential (−7.9 to −39.2 mv), and functionalities were explored as inhibitors of huh-7 cells (host cell) infection by hcov-229e, and they showed a concentration-dependent virus inactivation. boronic acidmodified cqds showed the maximum efficacy with an ec 50 value of 5.2 ± 0.7 μg ml −1 , illustrating the significance of boronic acid functionality to inhibit the early stage interaction of viral s-protein receptor with the host cell membrane. cell membranes mimicking nanodecoys are an interesting choice to fool and trap pathogens. these biomimetic nanodecoys include liposomal formulations, reconstituted lipoproteins, and cell-membrane nanostructures. 274 targeted surface engineered liposomes with antiviral antibodies constitute an effective strategy to provide protection against the infection of coxsackie a-21 virus. 275 similarly, mosquito host-cell-membrane-wrapped nanodecoys are employed to trap the zika virus and effectively prevent host cell infection. 276 lauster and coworkers presented an interesting approach employing an influenza a virus spike-protein (hemeagglutinin, ha) mimicking a multivalent binder that can bind to the virus in a distinct multivalent mode and inhibit its infection. 277 normally a multivalent manner binding is observed between the viral trimeric ha and the terminal sialic acid (sia) residues of the host cell's surface glycans. structurally defined presentation of sia ligands are functionalized on a compact symmetrical 3d scaffold, that is, a bacteriophage capsid resembling a host cell and targeting the trimeric ha ectodomain of the virus. k16 residues present in the protein coat of symmetric icosahedral bacteriophages qβ capsid (∼25 nm diameter) provided an ideal platform to anchor sia ligands with a varied length of the linker to mimic the ha trimer's binding sites (figure 8, iv) . cryo-electron tomography showed these qβ capsids covering the a/x31 virus (h3n2 subtype) envelop and significantly blocking the host cell interaction (figure 8 , v). phage capsid nanoparticles have shown the potential to inhibit virus infection during in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies ( figure  8 , vi).nanotechnology tools can play a pivotal role in advancing covid-19 treatment and vaccine development. information related to the structural morphology of the sars-cov-2 virus, its pathophysiology, and related immunological response is vital for nanotechnology scientists. in the absence of a specific antiviral against sars-cov-2, present therapeutics target the multifaceted molecular interactions involved in viral infections and majorly comprises repurposing already existing antiviral molecules used for other rna viruses. now, it is equally important to look for a suitable nanocarrier delivery technology to make these repurposed therapeutics safer and more effective. this manuscript provides systematic information on nanomedicine strategies employed to deliver small molecules, biologicals (specifically rnai), and various combination therapies. some strategies are also proposed for the rational development of this nanomedicine approach and its clinical translation. the journey of covid-19 vaccine development is very impressive and involves high-tech platforms such as viral vectors, antigen carriers, and delivery technology. a mrna-based vaccine employing nanoparticle (lnps) delivery is already in clinical trials, whereas another vaccine candidate in the clinical phase is using electroporation technology for the intradermal administration of dna plasmid. since most of the covid-19 vaccine candidates are sophisticated biological moieties (dna, mrna, recombinant proteins, engineered apcs, etc.), the scope of nanocarrier delivery becomes highly pertinent. this manuscript details the opportunities presented by these nanocarriers to potentiate the success of covid-19 vaccine in terms of efficacy and safety. some of these opportunities include nanocarrier-based effective/targeted delivery, better antigen presentation, and the induction of complimenting immunomodulatory effect. rational designing of nanocarrier-based vaccine is equally important for its clinical success, hence strategies related to the nanocarrier selection for antigen loading and effective delivery are discussed in this manuscript. a special emphasis is given to vans, which either act as a carrier for molecular adjuvants or mount a pro-or anti-immunity effect by their own. some miscellaneous technologies based on functionalized cqds and biomimicking nanoscaffolds are also discussed to present the scope of unconventional therapeutics. in this era of advanced nanoscience, we have all the tools to implement these technologies and play a frontline role in tackling this outbreak.the supporting information is available free of charge at

nanoparticles to enhance the overall "efficacy" and "safety" of a vaccine by various mechanisma recent outbreak of pneumonia in wuhan, china, is associated with betacoronavirus of group 2b from family coronaviridae and the order nidovirales [1] [2] . the viruses are positive-sense rna, enveloped and non-segmented [2] . this coronavirus disease (covid-19) is known as a third human zoonosis of the 21 st century and is caused by a new strain not previously identified in humans [1] . the coronaviruses causing minor infections of the respiratory tract in humans are nl63, oc43, hcov-229e, and hku1 while, the lethal coronavirus infections that emerged in this century are the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and the recent sars-cov 2 or covid-19 [2] . the source of the covid-19 is still not confirmed but some evidence suggests that the source may be in the seafood market of huanan in wuhan, china [3] [4] . the center for disease control and prevention (cdc) reported that the recent covid-19 is caused by betacoronavirus just like the previous two outbreaks of coronaviruses; mers and sars, the source of which is camels and bats, respectively [5] . the first transmission of cov from animals to humans was notified in 2002 causing sars-cov with a 10% mortality rate [6] . it was suggested that the virus needs some intermediate reservoir to infect humans efficiently as confirmed later by a thorough investigation revealing palm civets and raccoon dogs of the wet market carried sars-cov viral rna and might act like intermediate reservoirs [3] .the covid-19 rna virus carries a high mutation rate and ability to transfer from person to person as compared to other coronaviruses. according to the world health organization (who), till 23rd february 2020, the covid-19 affected a total of 78,811 individuals across globally of which, 77,042 were reported in china while 1769 were reported in other countries. the death toll in china is 2445 and 17 deaths have been reported in the rest of the world. according to the reports till 2nd january 2020, 41 patients have been admitted to the hospital of which most of the patients were men and 66% of them had exposure to the huanan seafood market and the median age of patients was 49 years [2] . the health-care workers are also diagnosed with the infection including those working in similar wards [6] . the time taken by covid-19 to infect other individuals is similar to that of sars. it is estimated that on average each infected person infects 2-3 persons and this occurrence increases two-folds, every 6.4 days [7] . it was observed that people with mild infection are more actively spread the infection [8] . due to critical nature of the outbreak, the virus was sequenced on urgent basis and the first sequence was available on 10 th january, 2020 online at virological.org. it was noted that covid-19 has much resemblance to sars-cov at the genomic level [4] . symptoms of covid-19 include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and dyspnea, sore throat and leukopenia. to date no vaccine covid-19 is available and is need of an hour to develop a vaccine to prevent further spread of the disease. to this end, immuno-informatics can be applied to a complete protein data set of the virus for deep antigen analysis and thus can save time and cost for designing a vaccine against covid-19. this will ease the early development of a vaccine and proposed design can be subjected immediately to experimental trials.the stepwise flow of the methodology followed to design a vaccine against covid-19 is illustrated in fig.1.   fig.1 . designed workflow for in silico vaccine engineering against covid-19.the complete dataset of proteins available in (ncbi) [9] coronavirus data hub (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?seqtype_s=nucleotide&viruslineage_ss =wuhan%20seafood%20market%20pneumonia%20virus,%20taxid:2697049&utm_campaign=w uhan_ncov&utm_source=insights&utm_medium=referral) was retrieved and subjected to screening phase to identify potential vaccine candidates. first, host non-similar proteins of the pathogen were filtered that show no homology to the human host (taxonomic id: 9606). proteins having sequence e score < 1.0 e -5 , bit score > 100, and sequence identity ≤ 30 % were selected [10] . again, a blastp search against the mouse (mus musculus, taxonomy id: 10090) was performed using host non-similar proteins keeping the input parameters e score cut-off 0.005, bit score > 100, and identity < 30% [11] . the screened mouse non-similar proteins were then subjected to tmhmm 2.0 [12] and hmmtop 2.0 [13] for observing the number of transmembrane helices. proteins having less than two transmembrane helices were subjected to spaan [14] for predicting the adhesive proteins as they have the potential to facilitate attachment to the host tissues [15] . selected vaccine candidates were then used in blastp tool to align the selected adhesive protein candidates with the probiotic bacteria proteome including three lactobacillus species: l. rhamnosus (tax id: 47715), l. johnsonii (tax id: 33959), and lactobacillus casei (tax id: 1582) to avoid accidental inhibition of the useful gut bacteria [11] .selected vaccine candidates were then subjected to the immune epitope database (iedb) bepipred linear epitope prediction 2.0 [16] [17] [18] . the threshold of 0.5 was used for the prediction of linear b-cells epitopes which were then utilized in t-cell epitopes mapping to identify subsequences with the potential to bind reference set of major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i and ii alleles [16] . epitopes were ranked according to their percentile score, the ones with the low percentile were considered as high affinity binders. the selected b-cell derived t-cell epitopes were then subjected to mhcpred 2.0 [19] analysis for interpreting their binding affinity potential. the cut-off criterion was set to ic 50 values < 100 nm for drb*0101 [20] . following this, the virulentpred [21] and vaxijen 2.0 [22] were utilized to validate the virulence and antigenicity of the selected epitopes, respectively. allertop 2.0 [23] was applied to remove the allergic epitopes. clc main workbench was employed to check the conservation of non-allergic epitopes required for designing an effective broad-spectrum vaccine.overlapping immunodominant epitopes were used to construct a multi-epitope peptide (mep) which is considered a promising strategy to stop viral infections [24] . one of the key issues with the design of peptide vaccine is its weak immunogenicity that can be resolved by designing a mep with appropriate adjuvants [25] . in the current study, mep was designed using aay linkers to combine screened multiple epitopes [26] . to the n-terminal of mep, an adjuvant in the form of b subunit of cholera toxin was linked to the mep thus creating a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (mepvc) [27] . the tertiary structure of the mepvc was created through a software called 3dpro of scratch protein predictor [28] , i-tasser [29] , and swiss-model [30] . the best model was further loop modelled using galaxyloop [31] and refined using galaxyrefine [32] of galaxyweb. to improve the construct's stability, disulfide bonds were introduced in the structure [33] using design 2.0 [34] . the sequence of the mepvc was translated in reverse and then optimized for codon usage according to the escherichia coli, which will end up in the increased expression of the mepvc sequence cloned in the mentioned expression system [35] . the entire activity was accomplished using java codon adaptation tool (jcat) server [36] . in order to assess the expression of sequence that have been cloned, the gc content and codon adaptation index (cai) were measured. the value of 1 cai is contemplated ideal [37, 38] whereas the appropriate gc content should be fluctuated between 30-70% due to favorable transcriptional and translational efficiencies [27] . there were other input factors carefully calculated to prevent rho-independent transcription termination, the binding sites of the prokaryotic ribosome, and the cleavage sites of restriction enzyme. as the final step of this phase, the cloning of the engineered construct was carried out into pet-28a (+) expression vector using snapgene (https://www.snapgene.com/).protparam tool [39] was applied for analyzing the physical and chemical properties of mepvc such as amino acid composition, estimated half-life, instability index, extinction coefficient, theoretical pl, atomic composition, molecular weight, and grand average of hydropathicity (gravy) to assist experimental studies. instability index is one of the key parameters that is significantly considered as it helps in discarding the unstable protein candidates (protein instability index > 40).in this step, the vaccine construct underwent immune response profiling and immunogenicity classification, which was done using the c-immsim server [40] . in order to predict the immune epitopes, a position-specific scoring matrix (pssm) employed by c-immsim was used. whereas, the different machine learning procedures were used to forecast the immune connections. this server is concurrently used to execute an immune simulation for 3 compartments such as bone marrow, tertiary lymph nodes, and thymus [41] . default simulation parameters were used which are as follows: random seed (12345), simulation steps (100), simulation volume (10), host hla selection (a mhc class i a0101 allele, b mhc class i b0702, dr mhc class ii drb1_0101 allele), and time step of injection was set to 1.the technique of molecular docking was utilized to predict conformation of the mepvc with respect to a suitable innate immune receptor. this analysis plays a significant role to determine the high-affinity contacts amid the vaccine construct and the immune receptor. the pdb id: 4g8a and tlr3 pdb id: 2a0z were retrieved from the protein data bank (pdb) for the tlr4 and tlr3, respectively. blind docking employed to calculate the regular pose of the vaccine construct with the mentioned receptors using an online patchdock server [42] . the resulting structures were further refined using the fast interaction refinement in molecular docking (firedock) [43] . the top ranked complex with the minimum global energy was selected and used to analyse the binding pose and intermolecular connections using ucsf chimera 1.13.1 [44] , discovery studio (ds) visualizer 17.2.0 [45] .16349, and visual molecular dynamics (vmd) 1.9.3 software [46] .in order to gain insights into the dynamics of the vaccine construct with the receptors, molecular dynamics (md) simulations have been carried out. the simulation analysis was also important to validate the exposure of epitopes towards the host structure for identification and handling of a substantial outcome. the md simulations took place in three different phases: system preparation, pre-processing and production [47] with an assistant model building with energy refinement (amber) 16 [48] . the antechamber program [49] was used to build the libraries and parameters for the tlr4 and vaccine construct. the tip3p solvation box (size 12 å) was inserted to solvate the construct. to study the intermolecular interactions, force field, ff14sb [50] was used whereas, the system was neutralized by the addition of na + counter ions. in the second phase of md simulations, the energy minimization of the complexes was carried out. each complex was minimized using the following steps: the energy minimization of hydrogen atoms (500 cycles), energy minimization of water box (1000 cycles, control of 200 kcal/mol -å 2 on rest of the system), minimization of the whole atoms of the system (1000 cycles with the restraint of 5 kcal/mol -å 2 on cα atoms), and the rest of the system was subjected to non-heavy atoms minimization with 300 cycles and restraint of 100 kcal/mol -å 2 . in the next step, the system was gradually heated from 0 k to 300 k with the time step of 2 femtoseconds and restraints of 5 kcal/mol -å 2 on cα atoms. in order to sustain the temperature of the system, langevin dynamics [51] with the gamma value of 1.0 was castoff. the shake algorithm [52] was used to put constraints on the hydrogen bonds of the system for heating. in the next step, systems were equilibrated for 100 ps with a time step of 2 fs followed by pressure equilibrium, which was attained using the npt ensemble with restraints of 5 kcal/mol -å 2 on cα atoms. the same step was extended for 50 ps with the 1 scale down on restraints on carbon atoms. however, the step of system equilibration was carried out for a time scale of 1 nanosecond followed by the production run of 100 ns with a time scale of 2 fs. for the production run, the berendsen algorithm [53] with the nvt ensemble cast off with a cut-off of 8.0 ǻ. simulation trajectories were calculated to investigate the strength of a complex via the cpptraj module [54] of amber. however, the visualization of simulation trajectories was done with ucsf chimera [55] , ds visualizer [45] and vmd [46] .in order to estimate the mmpbsa binding free energies for the receptors and multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct, the mmpbsa.py module [56] of amber16 was castoff. the program generated the input files for the complex, receptor and mepvc molecule using the ante-mmpbsa.py module. to compute the variance between the solvated and un-solvated phases, 100 frames of simulation trajectories were picked and analyzed [57] . for the precise values of binding free energies, the two different conformations were matched to the binding energies of significant residues. to estimate the free binding energy of the anticipated complex, δg bind, solv was resolved using the three equations given below:the net free binding energy was then decomposition into each residue to highlight the interacting and stable residues.the ncbi most recently dedicated a coronavirus disease data hub containing all nucleotide and protein sequences information published from across the world. in this study, we aimed at in silico prioritization potential vaccine candidates and designing a chimeric peptide vaccine for covid-19 based on all available protein sequences in the data hub. several bioinformatic and immunoinformatics techniques are employed with the aim to assist experimentalists in vaccine development against the virus.prioritization of potential vaccine candidates could help in minimizing time, labor cost and resources for developing and optimizing the success of getting an effective vaccine against the pathogen. in total, 193 protein entries were retrieved (s- table 1 ) and analyzed first for sequence homology with the human host proteome. this was significant to evaluate as homology between virus protein (s) to be used in vaccine designing and the host is likely to cause strong autoimmune reactions in the host [58] . this check identified two proteins: (orf1a polyprotein (accession id, yp_009725295) and nsp3 (accession id, yp_009725299) as host homologous thus discarded from further evaluations. experimental studies of the human vaccines are usually done in mice because of the many practical advantages they provide compared to vaccine research in higher animal models [22] . the appropriateness of mice as an animal model for vaccine research is defined by its ability to reproduce relevant human physiology [59] . considering this, a homology check was devoted to the pipeline and applied to the filtered human non-similar proteins (191 in number) to ensure the selection of non-similar mice proteins. this assessment resultant into shortlisting of orf1ab polyprotein (accession ids, qhq82463, qhd43415, qhr63279, qhr63259, qhq71962, qho62106, qhq71972, qhr63249, qho60603, qho62111, qhn73794, qhr84448, qhr63269, qhn73809, qhr63289, and qho62876) and nsp3 (accession id, yp_009724389) as mice similar proteins. the mice nonsimilar proteins will aid in discouraging false positive results during in vivo experimentations and accurate interpretation of immune protective efficiency of the prioritized vaccine candidates against the virus [22, 60] . next, enumeration of transmembrane helices in the pooled 174 mice non-similar proteins was accomplished. this transmembrane topology characterization is deemed vital in relatedness to the afterward experimental expression studies of the proteins. protein with transmembrane helices less than 2 in numbers are often considered as best vaccine candidates as multiple helices make recombinant proteins purification and expression difficult in vaccine development [20] . this result 33 proteins spanning across five types, and include: orf3a polyprotein (accession id, qhq71974, qhr84450, qhd43417, qhq71964, qhq82465, qho60595, yp_009724391, qhn73811, qhn73796, qho62878), nsp4 (accession id, yp_009725300), membrane glycoprotein (accession id, qhd43419, qhq71966, qhq71976, qhq82467, yp_009724393, qho60597, qhn73813, qhn73798, qho62880, qhr84452), membrane protein (accession id, qhr63283, qhr63263, qhr63273, qhr63293, qhr63253), matrix protein (accession id, qho62109, qho62114), and nonstructural protein ns3 (accession id, qhr63251, qhr63281, qhr63261, qhr63271, qhr63291) containing multiple helices therefore not proceeded further. the creation of adhesin-based vaccines is considered an attractive and effective strategy and is being explored as a solution to number of infectious pathogens [61] . the idea behind exploiting adhesin for a vaccine is based on the promising preclinical findings. the aim is to confer protective immunity via two main mechanisms: (i) opsonization driven by opsonising antibodies that is capable of binding the target antigen as an immunological tag leading to activation of other components of the host immune system for enhance recognition of the pathogen and subsequent complement system activity and virus killing by phagocytosis, (ii) neutralization driven by adhesin-specific antibodies that block virus binding ability to host tissues. the adhesion probability computation revealed 26 protein to have adhesion probability value greater than a threshold as tabulated in s- table 2 and can be ideal putative vaccine candidates against covid-19. the adhesin probability of protein ranges from 0.593 to 0.796 (mean, 0.645).antigenicity of proteins was predicted to reflect their ability of binding to products of adaptive immunity: antibodies or t-cell receptors. in total, 7 proteins: nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, 3c-like proteinase, spike glycoprotein, surface glycoprotein, and orf1ab polyprotein were recognized as antigenic and scored higher than the threshold. coronavirus nsp8 suggested having diverse activities, including template-dependent rna polymerase activities, canonical rna-dependent rna polymerases, cofactor function of nsp8 for nsp12-mediated rna-dependent rna polymerase activity, and metal ion-dependent rna 3′ polyadenylation activities [62] . nsp9 is a non-structural protein 9, key to coronavirus replication and is a single-stranded rna-binding protein [63] . nsp10 is a critical cofactor that switches on multiple enzymes in replication cycle. it is known to interact with nsp14 and nsp16 subunits activating their respective 3′-5′ exoribonuclease and 2′-o-methyltransferase functions [64] . the 3c-like proteinase is main cysteine protease and is nonstructural protein number 5 (nsp5) and essential in mediating cleavage of nsp4 to nsp16 [65] . the trimeric transmembrane coronavirus spike glycoprotein initiates infectious cycle by binding to a specific receptor on the host membrane followed by viral fusion [66] . the surface glycoprotein was analyzed to be different in a sequence patch (leu3-phe11) at the start of the spike glycoprotein. the orf1ab is replicase polyprotein cleaved by papain-like protease and 3c-like protease at specific cleavage sites to yield 15 to 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) [67] . the final numbers of potential vaccine candidates obtained in this step by step subtraction phase are presented in fig.2. identification of epitopes in given antigens is vital for a number of practical reasons, including understanding etiology of a disease, monitoring of immune system, development of diagnostic assays, and epitope-based vaccines designing [68] . from vaccine designing point of view, host adaptive immunity is highly specific and is able to recognize and destroy the invading pathogen [69] . additionally, adaptive immunity is able to remember the pathogens, creating long-lasting pathogen-specific protective memory enabling stronger attacks against the pathogen reencountered on successive times [70] . this arm of host immune system is driven by lymphocytes of two types: b and t-cells responsible for the humoral and cell-mediated immunity, respectively [71] . both cells recognize pathogen molecular components called antigens. the antigens interact with specific receptors present on the surface of b and t-cells. the activation of both these cells required antigen recognition by these receptors, in addition, to the second activation signals from the innate system. the vaccine candidates prioritized in the first phase were deeply investigated for b-cell epitopes. different lengths of linear b-cell epitopes were predicted for each protein and only recurrent epitopes simultaneously predicted by different servers were selected for chimeric vaccine designing. the b-cell epitopes predicted for the vaccine candidates were in the following order: nine for nsp8 and 3c-like proteinase, five for nsp9, eight for nsp10, 34 for spike glycoprotein and surface glycoprotein, and four for orf1ab polyprotein| partial. these b-cells epitopes are recognized as solvent-exposed antigens through b-cell receptors (bcr) and upon activation, b-cells secrete antibodies. antibodies have different functions including neutralizing pathogens, toxins and labeling pathogens for destruction [72] . the proteins were also analyzed for t-cell epitopes through very stringent criteria of p-value less than 0.005. the epitopes were of different lengths and interact with several different alleles of mhc-i and mhc-ii. for nsp8, 94 epitopes predicted whereas nsp9, nsp10, 3c-like proteinase, spike glycoprotein, surface glycoprotein and orf1ab polyprotein| partial protein were mapped for 61, 76, 153, 657, 651, and 44, respectively t-cell epitopes. these epitopes are presented on the surface through specific receptors known as t-cell receptor (tcr) allowing recognition of these antigens when displayed by antigen-presenting cells bound to mhc molecules [73] . epitopes presented by mhc i are recognized by cd8 (cytotoxic t lymphocytes) [74] whereas those presented by mhc ii are recognized by cd4 t-cells [75] . the cd4 t-cells later become helper t-cells that amplify the immune responses against the pathogen. comparative analysis of the predicted epitopes was further carried out to select epitopes that are common to b-cell, cd4t-cell and cd8 t-cell alleles in order to design a specific, effective, and strong vaccine. on this basis, three epitopes from nsp8 (drdaamqrk, qarsedkra, eqavangdsev), none for nsp9 and orf1ab polyprotein| partial protein, four for nsp10 (gcscdqlrep, ylasggqpit, ylasggqpi, tvtpeanmdqesfg), three for 3c-like proteinase (edmlnpnyedl, kynyepltqdhv, eftpfdvvr), five for spike glycoprotein (rvystgsnvfq, vnnsyecdipi, ladagfikqygdclg, gqskrvdfc, rnfyepqiittd) and surface glycoprotein (rvystgsnvfq, vnnsyecdipi, ladagfikqygdclg, gqskrvdfc, rnfyepqiittd). the epitopes were then reevaluated in antigenicity check to make sure their binding potential of binding to immune cells. for nsp8, drdaamqrk and qarsedkra were found antigenic with score higher than the default threshold of 0.4 whereas the third epitope eqavangdsev was found non-antigenic hence removed. all the four epitopes of nsp9 revealed non-antigenic therefore not processed further. in case of 3c-like proteinase, kynyepltqdhv was found non-antigenic whereas edmlnpnyedl and eftpfdvvr were antigenic therefore considered in afterward analysis. the spike glycoprotein contains epitopes vnnsyecdipi, and rnfyepqiittd as antigenic whereas none of the surface glycoprotein provided epitopes were antigenic. following, the affinity of the filtered antigenic epitopes for the most prevalent drb*0101 allele in humans was evaluated through ic 50 value and those with value < 100 nm were classified as high affinity binders. all the pooled antigenic epitopes were found to have great ability of binding to the mentioned allele. similarly, these epitopes were evaluated in allergenicity and virulent potential check and only virulent and nonallergen were selected. virulent check was significant in ensuring selection of epitopes mediating infectious pathways in the host. the final selected epitopes that cleared all these checks are tabulated in table 1 . a mep was constructed first comprising epitopes finalized in the previous phase. mep based vaccines are considered an ideal approach to prevent and treat viral infections [24] . the epitopes shown in table 1 were linked to each other through flexible aay linkers as such it allows efficient separation required for the effective working of each epitope. once the mep was designed, to its n-terminus an adjuvant of cholera toxin subunit b (ctb) was added [76] . the schematic representation of the mepvc is shown in fig.3 . ctb is nontoxic part of cholera toxin and is considered an accelerator in protective immunity and a break in auto-immunity. it shows high affinity for monosialotetrahexosylganglioside displayed on variety of cell types, including gut epithelial cells, antigen-presenting cells (dendritic and macrophages) and b-cells [77] . ctb is a preferred choice as an adjuvant because of its ability of self-expression in variety of organisms and can be coupled to antigens through several approaches involving chemical manipulation and genetic fusion resulting in strong immunological responses against the antigens to which it is attached. the vaccine construct was then used in a comparative 3d structure prediction to ensure confidentiality in selection of the most suitable model for the construct with minimum structural errors. several different physicochemical properties of the mepvc were deduced from its sequence. the vaccine construct is 189 amino acids long with total number of 2984 atoms. the molecular weight of the construct is ideal i.e. 21.36 kd as small size construct is easy to handle and purify during experimental evaluation. the construct has instability index value of 35.43, signifying its high stability. the aliphatic index computed for the construct is 79.68, reflecting high thermostability. the estimated half-life in mammals, yeast, and escherichia coli is 30 hours, > 20 hours, and > 10 hours, respectively. the grand average of hydropathicity (gravy) score is -0.315 which highlights hydrophilic nature of the construct. the theoretical pi is 6.10 pointing to construct slightly acidic nature.the secondary structure elements of the vaccine construct can be divided into the following order: alpha helix (56.08 %), 3 10 helix (0 %), pi helix (0 %), beta bridge (0 %), extended strand (16.40 %), beta-turn (7.94 %), bend region (0 %), and random coil (19.58 %). compared to the itasser, phyre2, and swiss-model, the 3dpro predicted structure was determined as the most suitable structure based on the complete modeling of the given length of the amino acid sequence. loop modeling was done at leu29-gln37, ser51-gln70, glu72-gln77, glu57-ser76, val103-thr113, and glu167-asp186. the model was refined to minimum rmsd of 1.734 å and molprobity score of 1.134 that is quite low compared to the original structure score of 3.312, reflecting good quality of the modelled structure. similarly, the clash score in contrast to the original structure is 94.7 times lower demonstrating steric clash free structure. the galaxy energy of the structure is very stable (-3784.31) and ramachandran favored distribution increased from 93.6 to 95.7 %. the top 10 refined models of the mepvc are tabulated in table 2 . the 3d models of the vaccine construct after loop modelling and refinement is presented in fig.4a . the overall z-score of the modelled structure is -4 and the score is within the range of same size proteins in the pdb illustrating good quality as depicted in fig.4b . refinement of the structure ramachandran plot demonstrated the construct to contain 93.2 % of its residues in the most favored regions, while 5.7%, 0.0%, 1.1% residues are in additional allowed region, generously allowed region, and disallowed regions, respectively (fig.4c) . the overall average g-factor of the construct is 0.05. ramachandran plot for the mepvc illustrating distribution of torsion angles (blue squares) comparative to the core (shown in red) and allowed (shown in brown) regions. residues in the generously allowed region are shown in dark yellow whereas disallowed regions are depicted in pale yellow.enhancing protein stability is important in many biomedical applications and is an appealing approach to emulate nature stabilizing molecular interactions [78] . the covalent disulfide bonds provide substantial stability to target proteins and disulfide engineering had achieved considerable success in broad range of applications [33] . in total, 11 pairs of residues were selected for the purpose of disulfide engineering. these include met1-ser81, lys5-ala59, val12-asp28, ser16-asp28, thr40-ser47, val73-gln77, ala119-ala133, met122-ala133, ala126-asp129, leu156-leu163, and asn159-asp162. the average chi3 and energy value for the pairs is 12.54 (max, 108.65 and min, -110.64) and 3.12 (max, 4.39 and min, 1.14). the disulfide engineered mepvc structure is presented in fig.5 . in the follow up experimental studies, the maximum expression of mepvc is highly desirable [35] . one requirement for that is the codon usage of mepvc that must be adapted according to the expression system, for instance, here we used e. coli k12 as a mepvc expression system. the codon adaptation index (cai) and gc content revealed for the improved sequence are highly satisfactory with value of 0.96 and 48.85, respectively strongly indicating high mepvc expression. the mepvc then enclosed on both sites by 6x histidine tag to ease its purification process and inserted at appropriate sites of pet28a(+) vector as shown in fig.6.   fig.6 . in silico restriction cloning of the mepvc into pet28a(+) vector. the insert is shown in red.molecular interactions and binding conformation of the designed mepvc with tlr3 and tlr4 innate immune receptors were deciphered via a protein-peptide docking approach. both tlr3 and tlr4 belong to toll-like receptor family of pattern recognition receptor and function to activate intracellular signaling nf-κb pathway and production of inflammatory cytokines responsible for the development of effective innate immunity [79, 80] . these receptors recognize viral associated molecular patterns and induce the production of interferon leading to activation of strong host defense responses. also, the specific adaptive immunity takes time to establish against antigens therefore it's important to evaluate mepvc affinity for the innate immune receptors. in case of mrpvc-tlr3 complex, the patch dock predicted 10 best solutions sorted based on the docking geometric shape complementarity score (s- table 3) . a high score implies enhanced affinity of the interacting molecules and best docked conformations of the molecules with respect to each other. solution 3 was visualized for docked conformations and intermolecular forces responsible for such high affinity of the molecules. the selection was based on the firedock analysis (s- table 4 ) which is an efficient package for refinement and reassigning procedure of docking scores to rigid body docking solutions. the global binding energy of solution 3 is better i.e. -6.39 kj/mol compared to the rest of predicted solutions. the contribution to the total score form attractive van der waals (vdw) energy is -12.12 kj/mol, repulsive (vdw) energy (4.79 kj/mol), hydrogen bond (hb) energy (-1.63 kj/mol), and atomic contact energy (ace) (5.95 kj/mol). the mepvc, within 3 å, was noticed to posed right in the center of the tlr3 receptor (fig.7) interacting via hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds with his156, asp180, lys201, glu203, ser206, phe227, asp229, asp230, ser254, ser256, asp257, ser282, tyr283, asp284, asp285, glu301, tyr302, phe304, glu306, tyr307, arg325, glu358, his359, lys382, tyr383, p408, his410, iso411, gly431, his432, glu434, pro408, asp457, phe459, gln483, and glu533. similarly, among 10 predicted mepvc-tlr4 complexes (s- table 5 ), solution 7 (s- table 6 ) was affirmed as best with total global energy of -10.39 kj/mol whereas the rest of complexes were noticed as highly unstable with score in positive. the attractive vdw, repulsive vdw, hb and ace contribution to the global energy is -35.75 kj/mol, 22.04 kj/mol, -5.51 kj/mol, and 12.61 kj/mol, respectively. visual analysis of the complex revealed binding of the mepvc at the interface of chains b and d (fig.8) . the mepvc is surrounded by chain b residues: pro23, glu24, ser25, asp44, lys47, asp50, asp51, arg67, arg87, glu89, pro113, gln115, asp137, his159, asp160, ser184, and lys186 and chain d residues: lys20, phe64, and asp114. the dynamic simulations of the human immune system in response to the designed vaccine construct were deciphered through c-immsim server [40] . the vaccine construct upon administration revealed to generate robust primary immune responses. as can be seen in fig.9a that combine igm and igg antibodies has a titer scale close to 10,000/ml followed by igm antibody (> 6000 antibody titer per ml). the combined igg1 and igg2 and igg1 were seen to generate high titer scale of around 6300/ml, 3100/ml, and respectively. the igg2 antibody response revealed to be low throughout post vaccine administration period. the dimerized soluble cytokine ifn-g produced against the antigen is > 400000 ng/ml (fig.9b ).in silico simulation of the host immune system using mepvs as an antigen. a. antibodies titer (a) and cytokines and interleukins (b) in response to the antigen.the stability and dynamics of the designed vaccine construct ensemble docked to innate immune receptors were disclosed through 100-ns of md production run and interpreted through the root mean square deviation (rmsd) [81] , root mean square fluctuation (rmsf) [82] , the radius of gyration (rg) [83] and beta factor (β-factor) [84] assays as depicted in fig.10 . the average cα atomic distance over 10,000 frames of tlr3-mepvc and tlr4-mepvc was decoded through rmsd assay. an average rmsd of 3.44 å (maximum, 6.30 å) and 3.36 å (maximum, 5.22 å) were estimated for tlr3-mepvc and tlr4-mepvc, respectively. the tlr3 and tlr4 receptors are observed more compact than the mepvc and as a result, continuous movements of the vaccine construct through its length are noticed at the exposed regions though rooted stable at the docked position. this seems to be responsible for bringing small structural deviation as probed by rmsd. visual inspection of the trajectories illustrated no major global and local secondary structure conformation changes in the receptor tlr3 and tlr4 structure. the mepvc movements with respect to the tlr3 are shown at different snapshots as illustrated in fig.11 . the mepvc seems responsible for the deviations in the receptor tlr4 at positions glu1-ser79, hie540-asn614, gln1144-gln1209, gln1347-pro1371, and lys1489-lys1491. continuous flexibility of the loops of mepvc exposed region is observed and is highly flexible responsible for the movements of the mepvc at the docked site though rooted stably (fig.12) . hydrogen bonding results when a hydrogen atom attached to a highly electronegative atom is attracted by another electronegative atom [85] . in a biological system, these hydrogen bonds are vital in determining specificity and directionality fundamental in molecular recognition [86] . the patterns of hydrogen bonds for both complexes were illustrated in each frame within 3 å in order to probe the strength of intermolecular association across the simulation period. the maximum number of hydrogen bonds of mepvc with tlr3 and tlr4 are 11 and 12, respectively demonstrating the high strength of interactions. the number of hydrogen bonds for both complexes are shown in fig.13.   fig.13 . the number of hydrogen bonds formed during simulation between mepvc and tlr3 and tlr4 receptors.in a protein molecule, salt bridges are formed between charged side chains of amino acids at neutral ph. the residues mainly involved in these interactions include negative full electron charge glutamine and aspartate and opposite positive full electron charge arginine and lysine [87] . the presence of salt bridges between the interacting molecules is a clear sign of strengthening interaction stability. for tlr3-mepvc complex high numbers of salt bridges were estimated within 3.2 å between receptor glu8, glu276, arg306, glu333 with mepvc lys3, lys8, glu83, arg16, respectively. in case of tlr4-mepvc complex, receptor residues arg646, asp268, arg1396 are involved in salt bridging with asp146, arg175 and glu184 of the mepvc, respectively.the binding free energies of both tlr3-mepvc and tlr4-mepvc complexes were computed using continuum solvation mmpbsa and its complementary mmgbsa. the binding free energies of the vaccine construct for the receptors were estimated considering molecular mechanics energies as well as solvation energies. the net binding free energy for both complexes revealed to be very high illustrating the high interacting affinity of the molecules. for tlr3-mepvc, the total free energy of binding is -41.4273 kcal/mol in mmgbsa while in mmpbsa it is -84.4908 kcal/mol ( after performing the immune system simulation to mepvc and a thorough peptide dynamics analysis, a novel mepvc is proposed as a probable solution to the widely spread viral coronaviruses outbreak. meanwhile, this seems necessary to have a deep down lesson as covid-19 viral outbreak is propagating to the human species on this part of the universe called earth. as we are already living under a serious threat of antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance [88] which if ignored can cause havoc and the current spread of covid-19 is a clear example of even a viral resistance coming in line. referring to the introduction section where the probable cause of this viral attack is discussed, this is mandatory to mention that there is retaliation from animals and animal-associated viruses or bacteria observed against homo sapiens quite frequently in the recent past [89] . this not only alarms the way of consuming animals in our food in the form of livestock but at the same time explains the advancing defense system of various species around. either it is horizontal gene transfer among bacteria or transient nature of viral transmission throughout the world as one way or the other this is a form of advanced defense of organisms. it is meant to state that even before and after the cognitive revolution, homo sapiens cannot be exempted from biological laws. while considering under the realm of these biological laws this is much expected from all other species to have the right of keeping and exercising a defense mechanism [90] . instead of spending on wars among humans there is a dire need to be equipped for all wars to come against human species under the disguise of either environmental hazards or antimicrobial resistance. even viruses are finding new ways of infecting hosts. under this perspective the role of avian has been observed as much dominating in the recent past [91] . after having insights from comparative advancing mechanism we mention here and thereafter the preliminary existence of a "theory of retaliation" on the basis of currently available facts and observations. this theory of retaliation will play its role in coming future. the continuous attacks in the form of outbreaks by them have raised many challenges and threats to human beings. a recent mechanism study by bazel et al reported h5n1 influenza viruses is posing threat to human and animal health and is currently unclear what restricts these interspecies jumps on the host side. it is further signified that pb1-f2 (a short viral peptide) assists h5n1 bird influenza viruses to overcome a human restriction factor of the viral polymerase complex hax-1. it is also evidenced that a functional pb1-f2 aids in direct transmission of viruses from birds to humans [92] . additionally, there is already a mechanism existing for the antimicrobial defense of avian eggs which illustrates their efficacy in defense mechanisms [93] . furthermore, discovery of avian antimicrobial peptides, classified as bdefensins, present in chicken and turkey found active against bacteria, fungi, and yeast. this is another example of advance mechanism showed by avian and the possibility of a common ancestral gene between avian and other mammalian peptides seems obvious [94] . who alarmed quite often that influenza viruses with a vast silent reservoir in aquatic birds are impossible to eradicate while avian influenza is proved to be a threat to human health [95] . even having the phylogenetic identity between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov, some clinical characteristics differentiate sars-cov-2 from sars-cov, mers-cov, and seasonal influenza infections [2, 96] . this leads to the fact that viruses are attacking humans with different clinical features every time. the complex relationships between the human and animal species never faced a halt in evolving giving rise to numerous infectious pathogens. whatsoever is the case, the dramatic impact of infectious diseases affecting the modern human population worldwide is evident and unexpected rise of coronavirus infections raised to 100000 while writing this research and getting beyond the normal control (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00154-w). after all we belong to the kingdom animalia with even ten on ten embarrassing similarities to chimpanzees [97] . probable prevention in this context is to somehow avoid the excruciating utilization and consumption of other mammals as edibles from homo sapiens and stop becoming a reason for the extinction of certain species. avenging from these species from time to time by utilizing the microbes associated with them against human has become obvious and vaccine design and discovery is of utmost importance. this is crucial to strategize a preventive control not only for symptomatic relief but in general taking steps to prevent hunting and strategy required to maintain a balanced ecosystem where specifically avian will not dwell under threat by sapiens. the advent of various new mechanisms of viral survival has remained sapiens perplexed and a broader strategy is required to circumvent this problem.in this study, we used available immunoinformatics approaches for the purpose to prioritize potential vaccine candidates against covid-19 considering their ease of use in experimental investigations. bearing in mind, the wide immunological applications of peptide vaccines only highly antigenic, virulent, conserved and non-allergic epitopes targeted by both b and t-cells were disclosed. a multi-epitope peptide was constructed and an appropriate adjuvant was added to allow suitable delivery and efficient immune processing of the epitopes. these promising computational findings might deliver preliminary epitopes set for a vaccine against the covid-19 notwithstanding the experimental testing in appropriate animal models to unravel real effectiveness. meanwhile, probable prevention discussed in this study for homo sapiens is to avoid becoming a reason for the extinction of various species either by hunting and/or over utilizing other mammals as this may be a reason for resistance both from microbes and other animal species of this kingdom. there must be strategic studies keeping in view the advancements in defense mechanism of avian and avian related microbes avenging humans. preventive use of animals or avian in human diet and avoiding hunting can be preventive optionssince april 2012, seventeen people around the world have been infected with a virus that has bafed scientists, public health ofcials and governments. initial cases in the middle-east were reported to the world health organisation's global outbreak alert and response network, set up to detect epidemics and other public health emergencies. te type of virus is known, a novel coronavirus, a species of the virus behind the common cold, but its origins are still a mystery. tis new virus is currently moving slowly, but it was a coronavirus that caused the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) pandemic which killed 774 people, so scientists who work on controlling the spread of new infections are on full alert.one of them is eric snijder, professor of molecular virology at leiden university medical center, in the netherlands, who has been studying coronaviruses for more than 25 years. in october 2012, his team identifed the genome properties of this emerging strain. it is now collaborating with an international group of labs in the hope of identifying compounds that may inhibit the virus's replication. te collaboration is part of the european project silver, a drug design program to tackle emerging diseases caused by rna viruses such as the new coronavirus.snijder's work represents the initial action taken when a new infection emerges. be it a new subtype of infuenza, such as h1n1 ('swine fu'), or a new coronavirus, understanding the biology of the virus and estimating the threat it poses is crucial. but the frst step is to fnd the virus, using global monitoring and surveillance systems.te who response network consists of 140 laboratories in 110 un member states recognized as national infuenza centres. johnmccauley is director of the who infuenza centre at the national institute for medical research in london, one of six that regularly analyses signifcant fu viruses seen in the population as well as other emerging viruses which may be cause for concern. if the prevalence of new infuenza strains increases, "it might indicate that the world is at increased risk of an infuenza epidemic, " says mccauley. global and domestic surveillance in the us is carried out by scientists at the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), whose labs in atlanta are part of the who network. constant communication is needed between centers to identify whether viruses recorded in diferent countries share characteristics.once a threat has been identifed, potential treatments must be trialed quickly and a pandemic preparedness plan put into action. tis is part of the remit of anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) in bethesda, maryland. "we need to understand the pathogenesis of the virus and how it may mutate and become highly transmissible to cause a pandemic, " says fauci. his lab then starts testing drugs and vaccines to stop the virus in its tracks. "we collaborate [with industry] and run clinical trials for new vaccines to determine the right dose, if it's safe, if it's efective, especially in vulnerable members of the population, " he says."in 2009, as soon as h1n1 became clear, we immediately went into action to develop a vaccine and tested the virus for sensitivity to drugs we already have such as tamifu -fortunately, it was [sensitive], " he says. identifying efective drugs helps 'buy time' from a public health perspective, as developing a vaccine currently takes about six months.during this waiting game, another feld -infectious disease modeling -comes into play, to predict and mitigate the extent to which a virus will spread. the modeling and economics unit at the uk health protection agency (hpa) was among those responsible for modeling outcomes for the 2009 h1n1 pandemic. "we run through diferent control scenarios, such as the use of vaccines or anti-virals, and see what may happen to the epidemic, " says edmunds. te aim is to gauge the trajectory of an infection and the efect of any actions, including economical and political control measures such as travel restrictions and school closures.models use characteristics like pathogenicity of the virus (how likely it is to cause an infection) to predict its spread, but these days can also use current information on cases and timings to model epidemics in real-time, a technique known as 'nowcasting' ."we use many diferent data sources and patch them together to get a glimpse of how many cases there really have been, " edmunds says. for those wanting to get into modeling, it helps to have a diverse skill set. "you need a range of people and skills to handle this. you need to understand biology, statistics, computer programming, economics and bioinformatics."an ability to work efectively with others is also vital, says edmunds, who sits on the scientifc pandemic infuenza (spi) committee alongside other modelers, virologists, and experts in risk management, behavioural sciences and diagnostics. together, they feed information to the government to guide policy and mobilize resources.infuencing policy decisions is not a role which always sits well with scientists, especially under the time pressures of dealing with the spread of dangerous viruses. "anyone that can provide clear information and communicate the risk has the power to lead a response, " says david heymann, head of the centre for global health security at chatham house and chair of the uk health protection agency.a particularly contentious problem is prioritising who should receive medicines frst, including chemoprophylaxis -where drugs are used before infection to avoid people getting the disease. "during h1n1, the uk department of health and the hpa made the decision to treat contacts of patients prophylactically to slow down the spread of the virus, " says heymann.despite the time needed for their development, the most desirable response to every pandemic is a vaccine. tis involves collaboration between governmentrun organizations and industry. kanta subbarao, who leads the emerging respiratory viruses section at the nih's laboratory of infectious diseases, in bethesda, collaborates with biotech company medimmune to develop vaccines against infuenza strains that show pandemic potential. "we share our data in presentations and publications -this becomes part of the body of information that informs further decision making in the government and pharma, " subbarao says. pharmaceutical companies instigate their own pandemic preparedness plans and played an integral role during the h1n1 pandemic. for instance, glaxosmithkline set aside two million eggs for vaccine production, as hen eggs are traditionally used to incubate the virus.working with highly contagious pathogens comes with risk. "we have to work in a way that minimizes the risk of infection, by using high containment conditions such as safety cabinets with gloved ports, negative pressure and use of flters to trap viruses," mccauley says.tis type of research is also extremely controversial, and the potential for viruses to become transmissible from animals to humans in the future -the study of which is seen as an important part of pandemic preparedness -notoriously led to a year-long moratorium on this type of research from january 2012. tese issues are among those considered by the newly-established centre for global health policy at the university of sussex, uk. "safeguards should be in place to minimize the risk of accidental or deliberate misuse of research on deadly strains of infuenza viruses," says center director stefan elbe.for many immunologists working to reduce pandemics, the ultimate goal is a universal fu vaccine. "we want to make a vaccine that produces a response to a section of the infuenza virus that doesn't change from pandemic to pandemic," says fauci. such a vaccine, if administered every 5 to 8 years throughout the population, could prevent a pandemic altogether. of course, it won't tackle the problem of emerging infections such as sars and the current coronavirus, but it's a step in the right direction to fght infuenza which has seen the biggest pandemics to date. "it's going to take several years to get there," says fauci, "but we're starting to see the frst glimmers of success." ■ nature editorial staf have no responsibility for content manufacturing the flumist influenza vaccine at medimmune.dr helen sabzevari has been in the feld of immunotherapy since its infancy, working to harness the body's own immune system to treat cancer. as she was doing her frst postdoc, at scripps research institute, in san diego, sabzevari realised that there was a disconnect between scientists working in her own feld of cancer immunotherapy, and those working on autoimmunity diseases. "normally, these two diseases are opposite sides of the coin, " she says. "autoimmunity is over-activity of the function of immune cells but with cancer there is a quiescence of the immune system. in my opinion it was really important to understand both sides."sabzevari ignored the advice of mentors, who had already seen her career progress in immunotherapy, and decided on a senior postdoc in the feld of autoimmunity. in doing so, she hoped she might fnd a way to use the mechanisms that cause the immune system to over-react in autoimmune diseases to kick-start the same cells, which don't respond to cancer.te decision paid of. sabzevari spent almost 10 years researching cancer vaccines at the national institutes of health, before moving to pharma company emd-serono where she leads their immuno-oncolgy research. using the body's own defences to attack cancer cells should lead to less toxic treatments for patients, says sabzevari. "with some of the advances that have been made, the patient can remain on the treatment for much longer periods of time with a better lifestyle."sabzevari is also keen to build bridges between academia and industry to hasten the availability of possible treatments. to this end she has set up a programme at emd-serono which allows postdocs to spend two or three years in industry before returning to academia if they wish.ultimately, for sabzevari and her colleagues, the aim is to see their fndings get to the clinic as quickly as possible. "every day we see patients, and we see families that lose people, " she says. "tis is not about me, this is not about my career, this is about the patient."the department of immunology at the university of connecticut health center seeks an outstanding investigator for a

infectious diseases has taken a heavy toll on humans since the beginning of the twenty-first century. one of the most well-known examples was the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in the winter of 2002 and 2003, caused by a novel coronavirus (sars-cov) [1, 2] . in distinct contrast to the mild human coronaviruses hcov-229e [3] , hcov-oc43 [4] , hcov-nl63 [5] , and hcov-hku1 [6] , infection with sars-cov frequently resulted in severe symptoms including fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and pneumonia. transmission of sars-cov was primarily from person to person and most cases occurred in health care settings lacking adequate infection control precautions [2] . the sars outbreak had severe consequences in 29 countries and regions, infecting 8096 people worldwide with a fatality rate of approximately 10% [7] . there are still no vaccines or therapeutics specific to sars-cov available 16 years after the sars outbreak. it is not hard to imagine how catastrophic it would be if sars-cov were to hit the human community again.while sars-cov remains a mystery and a loose cannon, another novel coronavirus emerged in saudi arabia in 2012, later known as the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) [8] . the fatality rate of mers-cov infection is approximately 35 .4%, and new cases as well as associated deaths continue to arise to date [9] . despite that most cases have been attributed to human-to-human transmission, mers-cov does not appear to transmit efficiently among humans unless there is close contact. the exact source of mers-cov and its routes of transmission to humans still remain uncertain. dromedary camels are believed to be the animal reservoir for mers-cov because isolates from camels are almost identical to those from human, and that many domestic camels are seropositive for mers-cov (reviewed in [10, 11] ). furthermore, current evidence strongly suggests that bats are the original source for mers-cov, as many coronaviruses phylogenetically related to mers-cov originate in bats, including batcov-hku4, batcov-hku5 and other mers-related coronaviruses [12] [13] [14] [15] . the batcov-hku4 was also shown to be able to engage the cellular receptor of mers-cov, adding evidence to the bat origin theory [16] . however, there has not yet been direct evidence for isolating mers-cov from bats (reviewed in [10, 11, 17] ).great efforts have been made to develop preventive and therapeutic interventions against mers-cov infection. in particular, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines targeting the spike glycoprotein are major areas of focus due to its critical role in mediating viral entry, and its potential in inducing protective antibody responses in infected individuals. so far, more than twenty monoclonal antibodies with nanomolar neutralizing activities have been reported and many vaccine candidates are underway in preclinical and clinical studies. in this review, we aim to capture the current advances and discuss possible strategies to translate these discoveries into an ultimate medical intervention against mers-cov infection.mers-cov belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family [18] . it is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense rna virus with a helical capsid structure (figure 1(a) ). the genome of mers-cov is around 30 kb (30,119nt) long and encodes 4 structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) and 16 nonstructural proteins (figure 1 (c)) [13] . like other coronaviruses, the mers-cov uses its spike (s) glycoprotein to interact with cellular receptors and enter into the target cell [19] [20] [21] [22] . as a unique structural component of the virion membrane, the s glycoprotein assembles into trimers and forms large protruding spikes on the surface of the virion [20] . the s glycoprotein is a typical type i membrane glycoprotein consisting of a globular s1 domain at the n-terminal, followed by a membrane-proximal s2 domain and a transmembrane (tm) domain [21] . the s1 domain mediates viral attachment and contains the rbd (receptor binding domain), which determines the host range and cellular tropism for mers-cov [23] [24] [25] . similar to other coronaviruses, the s2 domain of mers-cov, mediating membrane fusion, contains the hydrophobic fusion peptide (fp) at the n-terminus as well as two heptad repeats designated as hr1 and hr2 (figure 1 (c)) [26] . through co-purification with the mers-cov s1 domain, raj and colleagues identified that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4, also known as cd26) functions as a cellular receptor for mers-cov [27] .the mers-cov virion enters the host airway cells in the respiratory tract through fusion with either the plasma or endosomal membrane [19] . binding between rbd and the cell receptor triggers a cascade of conformational changes that lead to the formation of a pre-hairpin intermediate of s2, in which the hydrophobic hr1 is exposed and allows the fusion peptide to insert into the target cell membrane. this transient s2 intermediate then refolds with hr2 into a stabilized trimer of hairpins, also called six-helix bundle structure (6-hb), which brings the target cell membrane into close proximity of the viral envelope, resulting in the completion of the fusion process and initiation of the virus life cycle [21] (figure 1(b) ). structure-based design of various peptides able to block the formation of 6-hb have demonstrated potent inhibition on mers-cov replication and spike-mediated cell-cell fusion, showing great promise for further development into effective viral fusion inhibitors for treating mers-cov infection [26, [28] [29] [30] . among them, the peptide ek1 is effective to multiple human coronaviruses apart from mers-cov and therefore serves as a potential pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor [30] .recently, structural studies on the prefusion state spike protein of mers-cov and sars-cov have provided more insights into the spike-mediated membrane fusion process [31] [32] [33] [34] . the mers-cov spike protein trimerizes and folds into a metastable prefusion conformation on the virion surface, in which three s1 domains fold into a steady trimer structure and sit on top to stabilize the coiled s2 domains (figure 2(a-b) ). we and others have identified that the rbd of sars-cov and mers-cov can be found either buried ('down' position) or exposed ('up' position) in the spike trimer structure [31, [33] [34] [35] . the two conformational states of rbd may have distinct roles during receptor binding and membrane fusion: only the rbds in 'up' position, but not those in 'down' position, can bind to the cell receptor dpp4 (figure 2 (c-d)). great steric clash was observed between dpp4 and neighboring spike protomers when we mapped it to the rbd in 'down' position ( figure 2(c-d) ). transformation of the rbd from the buried to the exposed state is therefore a prerequisite for receptor binding (figure 2(g-h) ). on the other hand, this conformational change also seems to open up the stable cap structure sitting above the s2 cores ( figure 2 (e-f)). this may lead to disassociation of s1 trimer and exposure of the fusion apparatus, triggering the membrane fusion process.to gain a better understanding of mers-cov interaction with cellular receptors at atomic levels, we and others have determined the crystal structure of mers-cov rbd bound to the extracellular domain of its cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) [23, 24] . we showed that mers-cov rbd consists of a core and a receptor binding subdomain. mers-cov rbd and the related sars-cov rbd share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor binding subdomains [36] . the receptor binding subdomain of mers-cov rbd directly interacts with blades 4 and 5 of dpp4 propeller instead of its intrinsic hydrolase domain. the interface consists of a buried surface of ∼2550 å 2 involving 14 residues in receptor binding subdomain interacting with 15 residues in dpp4. the actual binding forces are mediated through two major binding patches. patch 1 represents 49% of buried surface and forms between the c-terminal end of the long loop connecting the β6 and β7 strands and blade 4 of dpp4. patch 2 occupies 51% of buried surface and forms a slightly concaved outer surface at the far end of the mers-cov receptor binding subdomain and a linker containing a short helix between blade 4 and blade 5 of dpp4. the concaved outer surface is made by the short β6 strand, c-terminal parts of β5 and β7 strands, n-terminal part of β8 strand and the β5-β6 linking loop. it is hoped that better understanding of the atomic details of the spike glycoprotein, as well as the interface between mers-cov rbd and dpp4 will provide the structural basis for rational design and development of therapeutics and vaccines against mers-cov infection. neutralizing antibodies are a major component of protective immunity against viral infection in humans. polyclonal by nature, the antibody response in vivo mobilizes a dynamic and complex mixture of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that work in concert to target various antigenic domains on the viral envelope glycoprotein. identifying the neutralizing mabs that constitute the neutralizing activity of polyclonal response and their recognized antigenic domains has therefore become the first crucial step towards gaining a better understanding of the protective antibody response, developing clinical intervention methods, and designing immunogens capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies.great achievements have been made in the isolation of neutralizing mabs in the past few years using various technology platforms ( figure 3 ). up till now, more than 20 mabs, most of which are human or humanized antibodies, have been described by scientists from all over the world. these antibodies are listed in chronological order of publication in table 1 , together with their unique biochemical and antiviral properties against mers-cov infection observed in cell culture and experimental animal models.it is apparent that the single chain fragment variable (scfv) library approach allows rapid discovery of mab, without time constraints from immunizing experimental animals or approaching convalescent individuals of mers-cov infection. the earliest mabs reported in 2014 were identified through screening non-immune human scfv libraries with the ectodomain of s glycoprotein (mab 3b11) [40] or soluble rbd from s glycoprotein (mers-4, mers-27 and the m336 panel) [37, 42] as bait protein (figure 3(a) ). these antibodies all demonstrated high neutralizing activities and therefore were widely used as reference antibodies in later studies.antibodies have also been generated from immunized animals (figure 3 (b)). several groups have reported mabs isolated from either wild-type inbred mice or transgenic mice expressing human antibodyvariable heavy chains and κ light chains. mersmab-1 (known as hms-1 after humanization) was isolated from mice immunized subcutaneously with chimeric s1-fc [47, 48] . the mabs 2e6 and 4c2 (humanized form 4c2 h) were isolated in mice immunized with recombinant rbd produced in insect cells [55] . furthermore, two human-like mabs, regn3048 and regn3051, were directly cloned from transgenic mice expressing human versions of the antibody after immunization with dna encoding s glycoprotein and purified recombinant s glycoprotein [51] . both mabs have been tested in humanized mice models and in non-human primates [51, 52] . the authors indicated that the advantages of their system not only lay in the human component of their antibodies but also in the quick speed associated with isolation and production, since no humanization or optimization step was required. currently, regn3048 and regn3051 have entered phase i clinical trials.most of the mabs reported so far target the rbd region of s glycoprotein, but rbd does not seem to be the only target for anti-mers-cov antibody responses. recently, a mab targeting the s1 n-terminus domain (ntd) region, which does not contain rbd, was isolated from mice immunized with s glycoprotein [57] . this antibody, 5f9, was shown to successfully block virus entry in cell culture models and the efficacy was comparable to other mabs in ic 50 . further, the mab panel d12, f11, g2 and g4 were generated by priming similarly, 3b11 and m336 were isolated from non-immunized human scfv phage libraries with mers-cov s protein or rbd protein as bait protein, respectively. (b) monoclonal antibodies sorted from immunized animals. the antibodies 5f9, hms-1 (mersmab-1), d12, f11, g2, g4, 4c2h (4c2), regn3048 and regn3051 were isolated from mice immunized with the indicated vaccines labelled in the colour-coded boxes, each representing a different immunogen; the bait or target protein for antibody selection were also listed. the mice from which regn3048 and regn3051 were isolated were given the pale blue colour to indicate that they express human immunoglobulin genes. nbms10-fc, jc57-11, jc57-13, jc57-14, f1b-h1 and hcab-83 were isolated from larger animal including llama, rhesus macaque and camels as indicated. the vaccines and selection criteria were also shown. ntd (n-terminal domain), fc (fragment constant). (c) monoclonal antibodies isolated from human survivors recovered from mers-cov infection. mers-gd27, mers-gd33, lca60, cdc-c2, cdc-c5, cdc-a2 and cdc-a10 were generated by culturing b cells sorted from the patient and screening for mers-cov-specific antibodies. mca1 was produced by constructing a phage library displaying scfv cloned from a convalescent patient. mice with dna encoding the full-length s glycoprotein and boosting them with s1 protein. among them are two mabs that target the non-rbd s1 (mab g2) and s2 region (mab g4), respectively [49] . these non-rbd-binding antibodies potently neutralized pseudoand live mers-cov in cell culture and were also protective in mouse models [49, 50] . together, the development of these antibodies elucidates that rbd may not be the single target for anti-viral antibody response. more studies are needed to elaborate the detailed mechanisms for these antibodies.apart from the traditional approach of isolating mabs from immunized mice, several groups have turned to larger animal models for antibody isolation. one group immunized rhesus macaques with combined dna and protein vaccines and isolated a panel of mabs, including jc57-11, jc57-13, jc57-14, and fib-h1, targeting both rbd and non-rbd s1 region of the s glycoprotein, all with potent neutralizing activities [50] . another group immunized llama with recombinant rbd and screened the nanobody library for high-affinity single heavy chain antibody [61] . these nanobody-derived mabs are smaller in molecular weight and more stable than traditional antibodies, and may provide a new option for future antibody isolation.in terms of closeness to authentic human antibodies, no approach can compete with those based on direct b cell cloning from convalescent individuals. one such mab lca60 was isolated from memory b cells of human survivors of mers-cov infection and was among the most potent mabs reported in neutralizing pseudo-and live viruses [53] . more mabs isolated from human survivors were described as more convalescent blood samples became available, including mca1 [56] , cdc-c2, cdc-c5, cdc-a2, cdc-a10 [50] , mers-gd27, and mers-gd33 [58, 59] (figure  3 (c)), all with potent neutralizing activities against mers-cov. the mabs lca60, cdc-c2, mca1, and mers-gd27 were also tested to be protective in animal models.as mers-cov research progressed quickly in the past few years, many mabs have been tested for prophylactic or therapeutic protection efficacy in human dpp4 transgenic / transduced mice models, and a few have entered large animal model trials such as in rabbits or non-human primates (nhps). however, as different animal models were established among labs worldwide with slightly different evaluation end points, it is difficult to make a direct comparison among these mabs. this is also true for in vitro evaluation of neutralizing activitiessince different cell lines, pseudoviruses, and neutralizing assay techniques are utilized, the published ic 50 values can only serve as indirect reference for comparison. head to head comparison in the same experimental system would be required to identify the most protective mab or combination of mabs against mers-cov infection in order to proceed to clinical trials.we and others have carried out structural studies of mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in complex with mers-rbd to understand neutralizing mechanism at atomic levels ( figure 4) . based on the epitopes revealed by structural studies, mers-cov antibodies targeting rbd can be classified into three groups (figure 4(b) , table 1 ).the first group consists of antibodies mers-27, d12, 4c2 and jc57-14, which interact with the cterminal segment of the β6-β7 loop and β7 strand of rbd by both heavy and light chains (figure 4(b) ) [38, 49, 50, 55] . their common epitopes on the rbd include residues val527, ser528, ile529, val530, pro531, ser532, trp535, glu536 and asp539 in the β6-β7 loop. the residues trp535, glu536 and asp539 also happen to be within the dpp4-binding site patch 1 of mers-cov rbd [23] , mediating interaction with lys267 and the carbohydrate moiety linked to asn229 of dpp4 [38] . therefore, the group 1 antibodies would directly compete with dpp4 in binding to rbd by interfering with both protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions between rbd and dpp4. structural super-impositions also showed that these four antibodies and dpp4 would have steric clashes between the variable domain of the heavy chain and the propeller domain of dpp4 if they simultaneously bind to rbd (figure 4(c) ).the second group consists of antibodies m336, mca1, cdc2-c2 and mers-gd27, which interact with the β5-β8 strands, β5-β6 loop and β6-β7 loop in rbd mainly by the heavy chain (figure 4(b) ) [43, 50, 56, 58] . their common epitope consists of phe/ leu506, asp510, trp535, glu536, asp539, tyr540, tyr541, arg542, and trp553. although antibodies in both group 1 and group 2 share the binding residues trp535, glu536 and asp539, their approaching angles to the rbd are significantly different. as shown in figure 4 (c), the approaching angle of group 2 antibodies is closer to that of dpp4 by rotating approximately 90 degrees anti-clockwise from that of group 1 antibodies, thereby generating more steric clashes with dpp4. this is also evidenced by a larger overlap between the common epitope of group 2 antibodies and dpp4-binding site on rbd [23] . as a representative of group 2 antibodies, m336 exhibits very potent neutralizing activity by not only mimicking critical interactions between rbd and dpp4 but also adopting an approaching angle similar to that of dpp4 (figure 4(c) ).the third group consists of antibody mers-4 and its variant mers-4v2 with four residue replacements in the hcdr3 (figure 4(b) ) [39] . by structural determination, it was shown that mers-4 fab and mers-4v2 scfv share the same mode of binding to the rbd (figure 4(b) ) [39] . analysis of the rbd/mers-4v2 complex structure showed that the antibody contacts with the β5-β6, β6-β7 and β7-β8 loops of the receptor-binding subdomain in rbd [39] . the epitope involves leu507, ser508, gln516, asn519, asn521, gln522, tyr523, pro525, lys543, leu545, and gly550 [39] . to be note, the mers-4 epitope has no overlap with dpp4-binding site (figure 4(c) ). by approaching the rbd outside the dpp4-binding site, mers-4 recognizes a unique epitope different from all previously reported rbd-targeting antibodies. comparisons of rbd in dpp4-bound and mers-4-bound states revealed that binding of mers-4 induces or fixes the β5-β6 loop into a conformation in which it folds into a shallow groove on the rbd interface critical for accommodating a short helix of dpp4, thereby indirectly disrupting the interaction between rbd and dpp4 (figure 4(c) ). such different epitope and mechanism enable mers-4 to synergize with other antibodies including rbd-targeting mers-27 and m336 in neutralization, which provides valuable addition for the combined use of antibodies against mers-cov infection [39] .in addition to the aforementioned ten antibodies targeting rbd, the near atomic resolution cryo-em structures of the trimeric mers-cov spike and its complex with antibody g4 were also determined ( figure 4(d) ) [33] . g4 is the first reported s2-targeting antibody and its epitope consists of a glycosylated, solvent-exposed loop residing in a connector domain between the hr1 and hr2 of the s2 subunit. in the unbound spike trimer structure this loop is largely disordered, whereas it extends out from two β-strands and is surrounded by all six cdrs (complementarity determining regions) of the mab g4 upon antibody recognition (figure 4(e) ). the specific spike-g4 interaction may stabilize the loop and further impede conformational changes of s2 subunit essential for membrane fusion after dpp4 binding. the binding epitope for g4 in s2 subunit is more conserved than rbd among mers-cov isolates, shedding light on g4 as a potential broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody for mers-cov. yet this loop between hr1 and hr2 is variable in sequence and length among different viruses even in lineage c betacoronaviruses [33] , limiting its application to other coronaviruses. in terms of pan-coronavirus medical countermeasures (mcms), the recently developed fusion inhibitor peptide ek1 is a potential candidate. the peptide ek1 was designed to target the more conserved hr1 region of the s2 stem, and was shown to block cell-cell fusion induced by spike protein from multiple human coronaviruses [30] .in general, most reported mers-cov neutralizing antibodies recognize the rbd in the s1 subunit, and these antibodies are highly potent in neutralization. these facts show that the rbd in the s1 subunit is a major vulnerable site for antibody recognition and neutralization. to be note, the rbd is also the region where most naturally occurring mutations of the s glycoprotein occur. currently, the comprehensively studied antibodies targeting the non-rbd region of the spike glycoprotein also include mab 5f9 targeting the n-terminal domain (ntd) of the s1 subunit [57] , as well as mabs g2, cdc2-a2, cdc2-a10, jc57-13 and fib-h1 targeting the non-rbd region of the s1 subunit [33, 50] . however, the detailed epitopes and specific mechanisms are still unclear for these antibodies. we expect that more antibodies with new neutralizing epitopes and/or mechanisms would be important for the combined use of antibodies against mers-cov infection.although monoclonal antibodies show promising antiviral effects in both cell culture and animal models against mers-cov infection, their roles are still limited in large-scale disease prevention in mers-cov high risk areas, as the therapeutic window is generally narrow for mabs and mass-scale production is timeand resource-consuming. vaccines still remain the best choice for mers-cov prevention.given its critical role in mediating viral entry and as major targets for neutralizing antibodies, s glycoprotein and its rbd have become the prime targets for mers-cov immunogen design and vaccine development. various approaches have been applied and more than twenty vaccine candidates have been reported in the past few years, including vaccines based on inactivated virions [62, 63] , virus-like particles [64] , recombinant viral vectors [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] , dna [49, 81, 82] , recombinant protein subunits [33, 49, [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] , and nanoparticles [80, 93, 94] . table 2 summarizes the critical features of these approaches and their protective potentials in experimental animal models.up till now, only two vaccine candidates, gls-5300 and mers001, have entered human clinical trials. the vaccine gls-5300 was the first to be tested in healthy human volunteers. it is a dna plasmid encoding the mers-cov s glycoprotein, requiring two-to-three injections delivered by electroporation [81] . the phase i clinical trial was started in 2016 at the walter reed army institute, and another phase i/ii clinical trial is being conducted in korea to test dosage safety and immunogenicity. another vaccine candidate, mers001, is a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (chadox1) containing the mers-cov s glycoprotein antigen [70, 71] . this vaccine only requires one-time administration of 5×10 9 -5×10 10 virus particles via intramuscular route, and the local adverse events as well as immunogenicity will be evaluated in the phase i clinical trial conducted at the university of oxford. in addition, one more candidate vaccine has been tested in dromedary camels either for potential human use or straight into veterinary use. it explores a modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) as a vector to express mers-cov s glycoprotein [67] . the regimen involves immunization through intranasal as well as intramuscular routes twice at a 4-week interval. the vaccinated camels demonstrated a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral rna transcripts in vaccinated animals upon mers-cov challenge. protection against mers-cov infection correlated with the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to mers-cov. as mva has established a reasonably good safety profile in humans and induced desirable protective immunity in camels, it represents one of the potential candidates to be further evaluated in humans in the near future.the remaining vaccine candidates are all in the stages of preclinical or laboratory development and invariably target the s glycoprotein or rbd critical for viral entry ( table 2) . vaccines based on inactivated [62, 63] or virus-like particles [64] have historical precedence in inducing protective immune responses in humans. whether the same strategies are applicable to mers-cov requires further studies, particularly when it comes to possible safety concerns [62] .apart from mers001 and the mva-based vaccine tested in dromedary camels, other vector-based approaches are also being actively pursued, including adenovirus [68, 69, 72, 73, 80] , measles virus [74, 75] , veev replicon particle [76, 77] , vesicular stomatitis virus [78] , and rabies virus [79] . all recombinant viruses encoding the mers-cov s or s1 antigen demonstrated strong immunogenicity in mice or non-human primate models, and some were shown to confer protection in mers-cov challenge mouse models (table 2) . however, concerns remain regarding the pre-existing immunity against these viral vectors from natural infection, because it would diminish the vaccine potency [95] . to overcome the issue of preexisting immunity against human adenoviruses while preserving their advantages such as high yields and strong immunogenicity, rare serotypes of chimpanzee adenovirus of low human seroprevalence may be adopted as viral vectors [70, 73] . our group recently developed a vaccine candidate with replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus c68 (adc68) vector expressing full length mers-cov s glycoprotein. seroprevalence of adc68 is around 2% in human population, much lower than that of the commonly used human adenovirus 5 (huad5) vector (>60%) [96, 97] . one intra-nasal administration of 2 × 10 9 viral particles completely protected human dpp4 knock-in (hdpp4-ki) mice from lethal mers-cov challenge, and passive transfer of adc68-s immune sera conferred survival advantage in lethal challenge mouse models [73] . further, the safety profiles of these vectors have yet to be extensively tested in humans. recently, hashem and colleagues showed that the adenovirus-based s1 vaccine may pose potential safety concerns because it may induce pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage in a mers-cov challenge mouse model, regardless of the its full protection upon lethal viral infection. they also showed that the pulmonary pathology can be mitigated by incorporating cd40l, an immune-modulator therefore potential molecular adjuvant, into the recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine [72] . whether this vaccine-associated pathology is related to residual infectious viruses or unbalanced immune responses awaits further investigation. with this in mind, all future mers-cov vaccine candidate designs should take extra cautions on safety evaluation. furthermore, recombinant-protein-based vaccines are widely pursued. strategies to solubilize the mers-cov s glycoprotein in order to form stable immunogens include forming nanoparticles and using soluble protein truncations. in particular, both nanoparticles formed with full length mers-cov s glycoprotein [93, 94] and subunit rbd-based vaccines [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] have been shown to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and to protect mice when challenged with mers-cov. one rbd subunit vaccine also conferred protection in rhesus macaques [91] . this indicates that rbd alone as antigen may be sufficient for protective immunity to develop against the virus. along with the finding that mab targeting ntd is able to neutralize mers-cov, lan et al showed that three doses of intramuscularly administered recombinant ntd protein also induced protective immunity against live mers-cov in human dpp4 transduced mouse model (ad5-hdpp4 mice) [92] . more recently, with the structural insights into the spike glycoprotein, pallesen et al developed a prefusion-stabilized s trimer vaccine by substituting proline residues into the s2 domain [33] . the introduction of proline disfavours the refolding of the linker between hr1 and the central helix, thus preventing the transition of spike into the post-fusion state. this rationally designed antigen, mers s-2p, was shown to induce broader and more potent neutralizing activity than wild type spike trimer protein [33] .finally, a prime-boost strategy based on a full-length s glycoprotein dna vaccine followed by an s1-glycoprotein boost was able to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies and confer protection against the clinical severity of diseases in non-human primate models [49] . compared with the protein-only regimen, the combination of dna and protein induced a more functionally diverse antibody repertoire and stronger th1 immune response. it was suggested that the native s glycoprotein conformation, formed on the cell surface after dna vaccination, helped induce more diverse antibodies against mers-cov.as summarized in table 2 , most of the aforementioned strategies require multiple immunizations which may pose additional logistic hurdles at the end point use. it is unclear whether these immunization strategies were empirically designed or due to relatively # abbreviations for animal models: human dpp4 transgenic (hdpp4-tg) mice with global/epithelial hdpp4 expression, human dpp4 knock-in (hdpp4-ki) mice with hdpp4 replacing mdpp4 in situ, mice transduced with human adenovirus 5 vector expressing hdpp4 (ad5-hdpp4 mice), and non-human primates (nhps).* efficacy in the specific animal model listed in the previous column. if studies are conducted in multi-animal models, only results in the highest-level model are shown. neutralizing antibody (nab).↑ indicates more, while ↓ indicates less.poor immunogenicity of candidate vaccines. for practical and compliant purposes, a single immunization with the highest immunogenicity in animals and humans will be preferred.the outbreak of mers-cov in saudi arabia in 2012 reminded us of the 2003 sars-cov outbreak in china. despite the differences in geographic location, epidemiology and immediate animal reservoirs, these two viruses share remarkable similarity in causing severe respiratory syndrome, leading to high fatality in humans and trigger serious public health concerns. with the advent of modern techniques in virology, immunology and vaccinology, we have gained substantial insights into the biology of mers-cov, and its pathogenesis with unprecedented speed and accuracy. as summarized in the current review, tremendous progress has been made in understanding (1) the entry process of mers-cov into target cells, (2) the structure and function of s glycoprotein and cellular receptor dpp4 in mediating viral entry, (3) antibody response during natural infection and isolation of broad and potent neutralizing mabs, and (4) design and development of vaccine candidates using various innovative technologies. however, our progress in translating these discoveries into clinical application has been slow. only two vaccine candidates and one mab panel have entered phase i clinical trials for safety. ironically, no vaccines and treatment strategies have been approved for sars-cov infection even after more than a decade of outbreak. we could not imagine how catastrophic it would be should sars-cov hit again or mers-cov continues to probe and gain strong capacity in transmission to and among humans.we are facing a difficult predicament when it comes to public health challenges in the new era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. on one hand, the human population is becoming ever mobile and exposed to an increasing number of pathogens. on the other hand, translating basic discoveries into preventative and treatment applications has been exceedingly slow. among many plausible reasons, a lack of incentives in financial returns perhaps stands the tallest. the deadlock is not just happening to mers-cov and sars-cov but also to many other infectious pathogens such as ebola, marburg, lassa, highly pathogenic avian influenza, hiv-1, and so on. fundamental and drastic changes have to be made in the entire research and development system before we can truly prepare and position ourselves ahead of deadly epidemic and pandemic. only then, can our speed and accuracy in basic discovery be timely translated into clinical and public health needs. the time to act is now.infectious diseases continue to plague mankind and evolve to keep pace with the efforts to control them. sir william osler captured the ongoing fear of infectious pathogens when he said, "humanity has but three great enemies: fever, famine, and war; of these by far the greatest, by far the most terrible, is fever." despite the significant impact of antimicrobials and vaccines on public health, there has only been one major human pathogen eradicated-variola virus, the agent of smallpox. in its place have been a series of new and reemerging microbes responsible for isolated infections, regional outbreaks, and global pandemics. bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens have the capacity to cause widespread epidemics such as the "black death" caused by yersinia pestis in 14th century europe. however, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases. focusing on viruses, a catalogue of newly discovered human pathogens from the beginning of the 20th century shows a predictable and nearly linear rate of new agents discovered over time. 1 however, of the more than 100 virus families, only 22 have been associated with human infections, a number that seems to have plateaued. 1 in this chapter we will concentrate on vaccines for emerging viral diseases.experiences over the last 3 decades with hiv, sars, and ebola have taught us the potential consequences of viral infectious threats on global health, and economic and political stability. emerging viral infections with pandemic potential can be chronic, persistent, or acute in nature. they can be disseminated by respiratory droplet or other bodily fluids. they can emerge from animal reservoirs and spread via insect vectors, and can be precipitated by changes in climate, animal habitats, human population dynamics, and other ecological events. 2 and they can emerge as a consequence of human activity in the context of deliberate viral modification as a form of biowarfare. we are faced with important questions including what can be done to anticipate these events and how can we best prepare to intervene when new or changing viral threats arrive?most current licensed antiviral vaccines utilize live-attenuated or wholeinactivated viruses, although there are now a few examples of effective viruslike particle (vlp) vaccines. in the setting of a new pandemic viral threat and without the advantage of a preexisting understanding of its pathogenesis, growth or attenuating features, it would be difficult to quickly develop traditional liveattenuated or whole-inactivated vaccine approaches due to uncertainty about the safety of attenuating mutations or the production of replication-competent virus in bulk. therefore, it is more likely that developing vaccines for emerging infections will involve new technologies, some of which have not yet been licensed for human use. using technologies that can provide a candidate vaccine based on information derived entirely from target gene sequences is safer and more expeditious than procedures requiring virus isolation and growth that require a high level of containment. therefore, even for virus families for which there are currently licensed vaccines, additional approaches beyond liveattenuated and whole-inactivated products should also be pursued.historically, decades have elapsed between when a new virus is discovered and when a relevant vaccine becomes available for human use ( fig. 28.1 ). in the setting of an epidemic, such protracted vaccine development timelines are incompatible with rapid deployment of a vaccine intervention and therefore not a practical consideration for immediate control of the outbreak. in part because of the 2014 west african ebola outbreak, emergence of new viral threats to public health are becoming more of a global concern and have more media and political visibility. fortunately, this is a time of remarkable technical advances in human monoclonal antibody discovery, structure-guided antigen design, and nucleic acid sequencing-making rapid development of biologics more feasible. therefore, defining new approaches and pathways to efficiently deploy vaccine interventions for emerging infections is a priority for public health agencies, commercial entities, government officials, and nonprofit organizations. however, the key to a rapid vaccine response is advanced preparation.several steps are needed to improve preparedness for emerging viral infectious diseases. these can be divided into 4 broad categories: (1) surveillance and discovery, (2) reagent, assay, and animal model development, (3) vaccine design and product development, and (4) manufacturing, clinical evaluation, and an appropriate regulatory framework.depending on features of the virus structure, transmission dynamics, entry requirements, tropism, and replication strategy, a vaccine approach should be proposed, designed, and evaluated in small animals for immunogenicity and protection against challenge. manufacturing a candidate vaccine for which there is no immediate market poses a significant dilemma because most stages of advanced vaccine development are carried out by large pharmaceutical companies that need to make profit to stay in business. while emerging infectious diseases pose a public health threat, they rarely present a compelling commercial opportunity. vaccines require a large investment and historically have a relatively low probability of being successful without an extensive iterative process of evaluation and redesign. therefore, in addition to new biological tools, there needs to be political will to prioritize public funding of advanced vaccine development and new business models for managing this process. 3 in this review, we describe the vaccine development efforts for three distinct viruses that collectively capture many of the challenges faced when developing vaccines for emerging viral threats. ebola, a member of the filoviridae family, is spread by body fluids and secretions with a relatively low attack rate but causes a systemic disease with high mortality. chikungunya, an alphavirus in figure 28.1 time from identification of a viral pathogen to vaccine availability. vaccine development is a lengthy process often measured in decades. many steps are required even for a traditional empirical approach including identification of target antigen; assay development; defining seroprevalence and incidence in relevant populations; understanding transmission dynamics and whether there is an intermediate animal host; developing animal models; exploring pathogenesis and defining immune mechanisms of protection; designing vaccine antigens; determining formulation, delivery route and method; preclinical evaluation for safety and immunogenicity; manufacturing; and several years of clinical evaluation and clearing regulatory hurdles. vaccines can fail at any of these steps, and it is rare for the first attempted concept to become the final product.the togaviridae family, is transmitted by mosquito vectors with a high attack rate and causes a systemic disease with low mortality but high frequency of chronic disabling arthritis. middle east respiratory syndrome (mers cov), a beta-coronavirus and member of the coronaviridae family, is spread by respiratory droplets and causes a relatively high mortality in persons with underlying disease. it has a reproductive rate (r 0 ) of <1 for person-to-person spread, but occasional "super-spreaders" can infect multiple people. the mers reservoir, dromedary camels, will continue to be a source of new human infections.ebola, chikungunya, and mers cov are representative infectious pathogens with pandemic potential. use of new technologies to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of viral structure and pathogenesis has paved the way for rational vaccine design for each of these viruses. herein we elaborate on the iterative path taken to develop and evaluate candidate vaccines for ebola, chikungunya and mers cov and the factors that propel or delay progress. we focus our discussions primarily on the candidate vaccines developed at the niaid vaccine research center, not because they are necessarily the most promising or advanced, but because we are more familiar with the events associated with their development, and the factors impacting advancement and implementation.ebola is a highly virulent pathogen from the family filoviridae. ebolavirus is an enveloped, negative-strand rna virus whose genome encodes 7 structural proteins including a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates viral entry into host cells. 4 the surface glycoprotein (gp) mediates viral attachment and entry and is the primary antigenic target for vaccine development. five species of ebola have been identified including zaire (the cause of the 2014 west african epidemic), sudan, bundibugyo, tai forest, and reston. ebola virus disease (evd) was first recognized in two distinct outbreaks in the ebola river valley of the democratic republic of congo (formerly zaire) and in sudan in 1976. 5, 6 evd emerged again in 1994 in gabon and in 1995 in an outbreak involving 315 people in kikwit, democratic republic of congo (drc). since then, sporadic outbreaks have occurred in equatorial africa, especially the drc, republic of congo, gabon, uganda, and sudan with fatality rates averaging over 50%. 7, 8 after an incubation period of 2-21 days, onset of evd is manifested by fevers, chills, malaise, and myalgias with onset of gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea by days 3-5. 8, 9 when fatal, death typically occurs by days 7-12 and can be characterized by hypovolemic shock and multiorgan failure. 8, 9 the disease is transmitted human-to-human through direct contact with infected bodily fluids through mucosal surfaces and breaks in the skin. 8 in mar. of 2014, guinea's ministry of health was notified of a highly pathogenic, febrile illness circulating in gueckedou and macenta. an epidemiologic evaluation ensued and samples from hospitalized patients were sent to bsl4 labs in france and germany. ebola was confirmed by either polymerase chain reaction (pcr), electron microscopy, or from isolation in cell culture. 10 viral rna was extracted, sequenced, and compared to available ebola sequences in genbank enabling phylogenetic analysis. an ebola strain was identified with 97% similarity to previously collected ebola strains in the drc and gabon. in turn, the outbreak was traced to a single index case, a 2-year-old boy who died in dec. 2013 in gueckedou. the epidemic of evd that followed has accounted for more cases than all prior evd outbreaks combined. as of jul. 2015, over 28,000 suspected and confirmed cases and more than 11,000 deaths have been reported with the majority of cases occurring in the west african countries of guinea, liberia, and sierra leone. 11 the world health organization (who) declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern in aug. of 2014. and as the outbreak emerged, the international community responded with an unprecedented effort to accelerate ebola vaccine development. 12 prior to 2014, the largest single ebola outbreak was 425 infections leading to 224 deaths. 13 the vaccine research center within the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases performed a series of phase i clinical trials between 2003 and 2009 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of gp antigen constructs. these included a dna vaccine encoding a transmembrane-deleted, secreted version of the glycoprotein, a recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (rad5) vectored vaccine encoding the ebola gp with one amino acid mutation, and subsequently a dna vaccine encoding the full-length, wild-type (wt) gp. [14] [15] [16] these phase i studies showed the wt full-length gp was safe and well tolerated. in parallel, studies to define the immunological correlates of protection and optimal antigen delivery approaches were evaluated in nonhuman primates (nhp). in addition to the important role for antibodies targeting gp, it was found that cd8 t cellmediated immunity was found to be critical for vaccine efficacy in nhp. 17 it was also found that antivector immunity would diminish vaccine potency particularly for the induction of cd8 t cells. because of the high seroprevalence of ad5, rare serotype adenovirus vectors were explored including human rad26 and rad35 vectors, and chimpanzee-derived rad vectors. 18 chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 3 (abbreviated as chad3 or cad3) encoding the wild-type glycoproteins from both the ebola zaire and sudan species was ultimately chosen as the candidate vaccine vector because of its low seroprevalence and its similar potency and pattern of innate immune response induction to ad5. this vector was originally produced by okairos which is now owned by glaxosmithkline (gsk). vector potency comparable to rad5 was considered to be important for rapid induction of both antibody and cd8 t cells with a single dose. this would facilitate use of the cad3-ebola gp vaccine in an outbreak setting using a ring vaccination strategy to achieve rapid short term protection for those at highest risk of infection. both zaire and sudan gp were included in the initial vaccine to protect against both zaire and sudan, the most common species responsible for evd. this replication-defective vaccine, now called cad3-ebo, provided 100% protection to nonhuman primates 5 weeks following vaccination in an otherwise lethal ebola challenge model, and partial protection (50%) to lethal challenge 10 months following vaccination. the cad3-ebo was also shown to effectively prime for a modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva)-vectored vaccine boost encoding the same glycoprotein inserts, improving survival from lethal ebola challenge to 100% at 10-months postboost. 19 the combination of cad3-mva prime-boost produces a much higher magnitude response and might provide more durable protection to health care workers, ambulance drivers, burial workers, and others with ongoing risk of ebola exposure.the first quarter of 2015 was targeted for phase i clinical evaluation of cad3-ebo at the nih clinical center and a pre-investigational new drug (ind) application was submitted to that end in aug. of 2013. however, in response to the epidemic, the nih, fda, irbs, and others coordinated efforts to consolidate timelines. an ind application was submitted to the fda on aug. 15, 2014 and a phase i trial began 18 days later. the cad3-ebo vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic in early phase 1 testing of two doses, 2 × 10 10 and 2 × 10 11 particle units (pu), and the day 28 postvaccination results were published 3 months later. 20 all vaccine recipients developed glycoprotein (gp)-specific antibodies; however, gp-specific antibody responses as well as gp-specific t cell responses were greater with the 2 × 10 11 pu dosing. antibody titers with the higher dose were in the range associated with protective immunity in the nhp challenge model.the zaire gp antigen encoded by cad3 was derived from the original mayinga strain of ebola isolated in 1976. compared to strains circulating in west africa it differed in very few gp residues outside the glycan cap, which is cleaved prior to virus entry. mayinga was also more related genetically to the outbreak strain than the kikwit strain that had been used in the nhp challenge studies. therefore, the available cad3 ebola zaire construct was thought to be antigenically relevant to the outbreak strain and suitable for testing. to directly address the west african crisis and to accelerate manufacturing timelines, additional phase i studies of the cad3 vaccine in monovalent form (encoding the gp from zaire, not sudan species) were performed in the united states, united kingdom, mali, and switzerland at doses ranging from 1 × 10 10 to 1 × 10 11 . 21 these studies, done in collaboration with gsk, supported advancement of the monovalent vaccine into an on-going phase ii/iii study in liberia (nct02344407) as well as us evaluation of a prime-boost regimen consisting of cad3-ebo followed by mva-eboz to evaluate durable immune responses (nct02408913). the monovalent cad3-eboz has also been evaluated as a prime for boosting with a recombinant mva vector provided by bavarian nordic expressing the gp from zaire, sudan, and marburg, and n from tai forest at sites in the united kingdom and mali. a similar vaccine approach using rad28 priming and mva boosting developed by crucell (now owned by janssen as part of johnson & johnson) has been evaluated in subsequent clinical trials.in parallel with cad3-ebo development, a replication-competent, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rvsv) vaccine expressing gp from ebola zaire (kikwit strain) showed promising results in preclinical nhp challenge models. 22, 23 the vaccine was developed by the public health agency of canada, licensed to bioprotection systems (a subsidiary of newlink genetics), and subsequently licensed to merck. the donation of 800 vials of this vaccine by the canadian government to who enabled initial evaluation of this candidate vaccine in 150 people at doses ranging from 300,000 to 50 million pfu in phase i trials in gabon, kenya, germany, and switzerland. although no lifethreatening adverse events were observed, there was evidence of unexpected viral seeding of joints and transient arthritis in addition to vaccine virus positive skin vesicles in some participants. a lower dose of rvsv-zebov (300,000 pfu im) did not diminish the likelihood of rvsv infecting peripheral tissues. thirteen of 51 participants developed arthritis and 2 participants developed cutaneous lymphocytic vasculitis with rvsv established as the etiology based on synovial fluid and skin lesion analysis. 24, 25 the vaccine was immunogenic and all vaccine recipients evaluated developed gp-specific antibody responses. 26 an additional evaluation of this candidate vaccine in two phase i trials in the united states (wrair and nih) supported advancement of the vaccine at 20 million pfu dosing. compared to 3 million pfu dosing, 20 million pfu resulted in higher igg and neutralizing antibody titers. 27 the higher dose vaccine is currently under evaluation in the niaid-sponsored prevail trial in liberia, the cdc-sponsored strive study in sierra leone, and the who-sponsored ebola ça suffit study in guinea. notably, the skin and joint complications were not seen during active follow-up of individuals in the united states or african studies.interim results from the ebola ça suffit phase iii trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of rvsv-zebov in an unblinded, cluster-randomized trial in guinea are encouraging and consistent with vaccine efficacy. the trial utilized a ring vaccination design in which individuals at high risk of infection (contacts and contacts-of-contacts of a lab confirmed case of evd) were randomized as a cluster to receive either immediate vaccination with rvsv-zebov or delayed vaccination 21 days later. there were no cases of evd with symptom onset >10 days following randomization in the group receiving immediate vaccination (48 clusters with 2014 subjects) whereas the authors reported 16 cases of evd in subjects randomized to delayed vaccination (42 clusters with 2380 subjects). 28 the pathway to licensure of new vaccines requires evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy in clinical trials. for infectious pathogens that emerge sporadically and with low incidence, such as ebola, the ability to perform randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded efficacy trials remains a limiting factor. the hard fought decline in evd cases in west africa is welcome and will hopefully lead to complete control of the epidemic without rebound or reemergence. however, the decline will likely preclude efforts to evaluate vaccine efficacy of other vaccine candidates during this outbreak. for the cad3-ebo vaccine, it remains unknown if a path to licensure is feasible in the absence of human efficacy data. regulators will need to consider if supportive evidence from preclinical nhp challenge models, safety data in on-going human trials, and use of alternative surrogate immunogenicity endpoints is adequate to move forward with licensing.therefore, several challenging questions remain for regulators and vaccine developers alike. these include determining which ebola vaccines will be made available for the next ebola epidemic and what trial design will be used (ie, ring vaccination strategy with delay or community randomization; a step-wedge design with staged vaccination; or a placebo-controlled, randomized study) or whether the initial results from the recent trial will preclude further evaluation of experimental (unlicensed) products. 28 nonetheless, several important lessons can be extracted from the recent development of ebola vaccine candidates. perhaps the most important is that the rapid development and testing of candidate vaccines in 2014 and 2015 was made possible because of years of prior investment into the study of ebola basic virology and pathogenesis, in part driven by biodefense concerns. other factors that enabled accelerated vaccine development include: (1) preexisting established animal models, (2) preclinical data from nhp challenge studies, (3) the presence of cgmp vaccine product, and (4) global concern, extensive media coverage and political visibility that helped foster coordination between funding agencies, regulatory authorities, governments, clinical trial sites, laboratories, commercial partners, and publishers.chikungunya virus (chikv) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus of the family togaviridae transmitted primarily by aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus mosquitoes. 29 three chikv clades have been identified and include west african, asian, and east/central/south african, each sharing significant amino acid homology. chikungunya infection manifests as abrupt onset of fever, myalgias, rash, headache, nausea, and arthralgias with illness onset typically 3-7 days following viral transmission. [30] [31] [32] the hallmark arthritis of chikv infection can be relapsing, incapacitating, and may persist for months. 30 severe manifestations of chikungunya can include myocarditis, hepatitis, and neurologic complications including encephalitis. 33 and although rare, deaths have occurred particularly in the elderly and infants. there are currently no fda licensed vaccines or treatments specific for chikungunya.chikv has an 11.8 kb, single-stranded, positive-sense rna genome that encodes 4 nonstructural proteins involved in virus replication (nsp1-4) and 5 structural proteins including the capsid and envelope glycoproteins e1 and e2. 30, 32, 34 the e1 glycoprotein mediates cell fusion and the e2 glycoprotein interacts with the host receptor. the mature virion diameter is 70 nm and the external surface exhibits trimeric spikes consisting of 240 e2/e1 heterodimers. 32 chikungunya virus was discovered at the east african virology research institute in entebbe, uganda, now the uganda virology institute (uvri) and was isolated from a member of the makonde tribe in tanzania in the early 1950s. chikv has been responsible for outbreaks in africa and asia since the 1960s. 31 chikv is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of africa where it exists as part of an enzootic cycle. however, intermittent epidemics emerge characterized by human-mosquito-human transmission with attack rates that can exceed 50%. 32 aegypti. an east/central/south african (ecsa) strain has more recently been detected in brazil, which may make adaptation to a. albopictus more likely. if this occurs, broader spread into north america is possible.chikv viremia peaks on the day of symptom onset with titers reaching 10 9 viral rna copies/ml. 36 both neutralizing activity and induction of igg3 antibody isotype early in the course of infection are associated with lower risk of chronic disease and persistent arthralgias. 37, 38 research to date supports an antibody-mediated mechanism of protection from chikv infection 39 and passive protection was shown in an otherwise lethal mouse model of chikv infection following igg administration from nhps who had received a chikungunya virus-like particle (vlp) vaccine. 34 several promising candidate vaccine platforms have been evaluated including formalin-inactivated chikv vaccines, 40,41 recombinant mva and measles vectored vaccines, 42,43 chimeric alphavirus vaccines, 44 insect cell-produced vlp vaccine candidates, 45 and dna vaccine candidates. 46, 47 a live, attenuated chikv vaccine was advanced into phase ii testing and induced neutralizing antibodies to chikv by day 28 in 98% of recipients but was also associated with arthralgias in 8% of subjects. 48 due to our familiarity with the limitations and obstacles for advancement of a candidate vaccine developed at the niaid vaccine research center, we will focus the discussion primarily on a mammalian cell-produced vlp vaccine. this candidate vaccine was evaluated in a phase i clinical trial and is currently being advanced into phase ii clinical testing. to produce the vlp, akahata and coworkers transfected 293t hek cells with expression vectors encoding c-e3-e2-6k-e1 proteins from the west african chikv strain 37997. electron microscopy revealed production of vlps with the same morphologic appearance as wild-type chikv, characterized by a 65 nm external diameter, 40 nm core diameter, and a structure with e1 and e2 glycoproteins organized into 240 heterodimers and 80 glycoprotein spikes. in preclinical assessment, all nhps receiving this vlp developed neutralizing antibodies to both heterologous and homologous chikv strains. in a challenge model, all nhps were protected against viremia as well as the postinflammatory sequelae of infection when exposed to intravenous chikv challenge 15 weeks after vlp administration. 34 the vlp vaccine candidate was found to be safe and immunogenic in a phase i, dose-escalation clinical trial evaluating a dose range of 10-40 µg over a 3 dose regimen (weeks 0, 4, and 20) in 25 healthy adults. neutralizing antibodies against an outbreak strain from the ecsa clade were identified in all participants 4 weeks following the second vaccination revealing both robust immunogenicity and evidence of cross-reactive neutralizing activity. 49 several advantages of this vlp vaccine include its highly symmetric exterior that resembles wild-type virus, induction of high titer neutralizing antibody, safety profile as a nonreplicating candidate vaccine with low containment manufacturing. factors contributing to the delay in advanced development of this vaccine include difficulty in establishing a commercial partnership, resources needed for process development and scale-up, and difficulties in establishing clinical trial infrastructure for defining efficacy and immune correlates of protection. due to the ongoing chikungunya epidemic in the americas and the caribbean, there is an opportunity to obtain an efficacy result in a field trial. therefore, advancing clinical evaluation of candidate vaccines should be a public health imperative. if field trials are delayed until the outbreak has saturated the region and the disease becomes more sporadic, it will be difficult to ever obtain an efficacy outcome or establish an immunological correlate of protection. this will complicate achieving licensure for general use, and is another example of how public options for manufacturing would facilitate the development of vaccines for emerging infectious diseases.coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense rna viruses with very large genomes (∼30 kb). endemic human coronaviruses are widespread and include coronaviruses hcov-229e, oc43, nl63, and hku1 which generally cause mild respiratory infections including the common cold. however, several features of coronaviruses allow adaptation to new hosts and ecological niches. 50 these include large rna genomes, high frequency of rna recombination, and infidelity of the rna-dependent rna polymerase. following the 2002 emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars cov), a highly pathogenic lineage b betacoronavirus, concerns arose that novel coronaviruses could represent a major public health threat. this was further validated by the emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers cov).the first case of mers cov was reported in 2012 in a 60-year-old male in saudi arabia with acute pneumonia who subsequently died from progressive pulmonary and renal failure. 50 the subsequent rapid international response to the emergence of mers cov included genomic sequencing, development of diagnostic assays, surveillance for a zoonotic reservoir, development of animal models, and evaluation of viral pathogenesis to enable rational design of candidate vaccines.the complete genome sequence of the implicated coronavirus was rapidly identified and made available in genbank. genomic sequencing enabled phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis and mers cov was identified as a lineage c betacoronavirus, distinct from previously known human coronaviruses and most closely related to hku4 and hku5 coronaviruses previously isolated from bats. 50, 51 clinical presentation of mers cov can range from asymptomatic to a severe respiratory illness that culminates in death. following an incubation period of 5.2 days (1.9-14.7 days), presenting symptoms can include fever, cough, and dyspnea. rapid deterioration of respiratory status can occur within just a few days of symptom onset and fatality rates are estimated to be about 35%. since 2012, there have been 1595 lab-confirmed cases of mers cov infection and at least 571 deaths globally. 52 this includes an outbreak of 186 individuals in south korea initiated by a single index case, a man returning from a trip to saudi arabia. the outbreak in seoul was primarily restricted to hospital settings where 5 individual "super-spreaders" accounted for the majority of infections of other patients and health care providers. 53 mers cov expresses a membrane-anchored trimeric spike (s) protein that consists of a s1 subunit that engages the receptor on the host cell and a s2 subunit that mediates membrane fusion. 54 the receptor binding domain on s1 has served as the primary antigenic target for vaccine development. similar to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) peptidase receptor used by sars cov, the mers cov target cell receptor is cd26, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), which is a 766 amino acid, type ii transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells of several organs including lung and kidney. dpp4 has been shown to be a biomarker of il-13 expression in asthma and is associated with glycemic homeostasis and microvascular complications of diabetes. 55, 56 transfection of human dpp4 into otherwise nonsusceptible cells from feline, murine and canine species enables mers cov infection. 57 lu et al. subsequently solved the crystal structure of the receptor binding domain of s1 in complex with cd26. 58 comparative serologic studies emerged shortly after mers cov was first identified to look for zoonotic reservoirs. evaluation of serum-specific igg targeting the receptor-binding s1 subunit was performed by protein microarray and confirmed by virus neutralization testing and revealed high-titer neutralizing antibodies were prevalent in camels. 59 experimental support for the camel as a zoonotic reservoir was performed by adney and coworkers who inoculated camels with mers cov. the camels subsequently developed upper respiratory symptoms and showed evidence of upper respiratory tract viral shedding in nasal secretions for 7 days postinoculation. 60 evidence of zoonotic transmission from camel to humans was further supported from a patient in 2013 who died of mers cov following exposure to camels with rhinorrhea. nasal swabs for both the patient and camels were positive for mers cov rna and subsequent genomic sequencing revealed the isolates to be identical 61 however, not all cases of mers cov infection have been linked to camel exposure. additional studies are needed to further define transmission dynamics and intermediate hosts.low herd immunity in humans, a highly pathogenic virus and evidence of both zoonotic and human-to-human transmission suggest that outbreaks of mers cov will continue to occur and may have pandemic potential. there are currently no fda approved vaccines for mers cov but previous vaccine development efforts for sars cov created a foundation for mers cov vaccine design. the sars spike protein is similarly responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion and is the primary antigen target for neutralizing antibody and vaccine development. 62 candidate mers cov vaccines also target the spike protein. approaches have included subunit proteins, dna, and gene-based vectors. a recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara vaccine expressing the full length mers cov spike protein produced neutralizing antibody in immunized mice. 63 subsequently, ma and coworkers focused on the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the mers cov spike protein to develop a subunit protein vaccine. five different receptor binding domain fragments from s1 were individually fused with the fc of human igg and each was evaluated for receptor binding affinity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential. the s377-588-fc fragment that contains the stably folded rbd had the highest affinity for dpp4 and induced the highest titer neutralizing antibodies in both mice and immunized rabbits while minimizing exposure to nonneutralizing epitopes. 64 in addition, two recombinant vaccine candidates have been developed using either a baculovirusbased expression system or a venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particle approach. 65, 66 potent neutralization was induced in mice and nhps following immunization with dna expressing the full-length spike protein followed by a boost with s1 subunit glycoprotein. this strategy elicited responses against both rbd and non-rbd neutralizing epitopes which may decrease the chance of escape mutations. this dna prime-protein boost regimen provided protection from computerized tomography (ct) defined pneumonia in a nhp viral challenge model. 67 this work highlights the importance of developing mabs against the vaccine target antigen in order to define mechanisms of viral neutralization, protein structure, and antigenicity to guide rational vaccine design.a dna plasmid-based vaccine encoding full length consensus mers spike protein was constructed based on available s protein genomic sequences in the genbank-ncbi database. the vaccine induced polyfunctional t cell and humoral responses in mice and nhps, including antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, macaques, and camels. the vaccine also provided protection from pneumonia in a nhp viral challenge model. 68 there are no clinical trial data yet for candidate mers cov vaccines. mers cov is likely to continue to cause sporadic outbreaks, fueled by camel exposure and the occasional super-spreading event. however, the relatively low r 0 suggests that mers cov has a relatively low probability of causing a widespread pandemic. therefore, the target populations for a vaccine when available is not the general population, but groups at high risk of exposure to animal reservoirs, health care workers in endemic regions, and possibly at-risk travelers. with this relatively small market, it will be difficult for commercial organizations to invest in mers cov vaccine development. with such low incidence, a field study to evaluate efficacy will be large and difficult to complete. therefore, questions again are raised about how to achieve advanced development and licensing of a vaccine for this type of emerging virus.the activities needed to prepare for future pandemic viral threats include a broad spectrum of disciplines and skill sets ranging from logistics and communication to epidemiology and ecology, clinical trials, and highly technical biomedical research programs. fortunately, relatively recent technological advances have made the prospects of a comprehensive program to systematically prepare for emerging infectious diseases more feasible. if done with forethought, the development of such a program would strengthen existing health care programs, build research infrastructure, and significantly improve the status of global public health. in particular, we should take advantage of new technologies such as high throughput sequencing, isolation of human monoclonal antibodies, structural biology, atomic-level antigen design, molecular biology, and vector biology. these tools can provide the information needed for rapid achievement of optimal expression, immunogenicity, production, and delivery of vaccine antigens for new emerging threats like the current crisis caused by zika virus (fig. 28.2) .due to the new technologies available for surveillance, assay development, vaccine design, animal modeling, and manufacturing, the scientific aspects of vaccine development are not limiting our ability to prepare for emerging viral diseases. the major factors that need to be addressed include (1) the political will to provide the resources necessary to conduct the epidemiology and laboratory work needed to support vaccine development, (2) new business models to create an infrastructure for advanced vaccine development that does not require profit motive, and (3) creative regulatory processes and clinical trial designs to evaluate products for efficacy during outbreaks that are by nature sporadic and causing social chaos. importantly, achieving solid efficacy data that can support licensure is critical so products can be more readily available during future epidemics. novel approaches to vaccine design may significantly shorten vaccine development timelines and increase the frequency of success. new technologies that have rapidly evolved over the last 5-10 years make atomic level antigen design feasible and provide mechanisms for rapid, iterative improvements in antigenicity and immunogenicity of candidate vaccines. in particular, high throughput sequencing provides a starting point for vaccine antigens and helps to define the extent of genetic variability. relatively inexpensive gene synthesis, the ease of isolating and characterizing human monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against target antigens, the ability to define structures of vaccine antigens in complex with mabs with desirable functional properties, and the development of assays that evaluate immunogenicity of vaccines in animal models, provide the foundation for rapid development of highly characterized candidate vaccines and their advancement into clinical evaluation. the figure illustrates the steps taken in the case of mers cov to rapidly develop the tools needed to generate candidate vaccines. advanced knowledge of effective vaccine approaches for a particular virus family together with these modern development and design approaches may significantly shorten the time needed to prepare vaccines for field testing in the setting of a new pandemic threat.was successfully re-isolated from the nasal swabs and lung lesions of these animals, and a specific antibody response to the virus was shown in the infected animals, sars-cov proved to be the causative agent of this infectious disease kuiken et al., 2003 ) .sars-cov is a single-stranded, positive-sense rna virus, phylogentically related to coronaviruses from group 2 despite the fact that it does not encode a hemagglutinin-esterase protein ( snijder et al., 2003 ) . the genome is packaged together with the nucleocapsid protein, at least five membrane proteins (m, e, 3a, 7a, and 7b) and the spike (s) protein ( fig. 36.1 ) . the s1 region within the s protein, and more specifically a 193-amino acid fragment of the s protein (corresponding to residues 318-510), has been identified as the region that interacts with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( li et al., 2005a ) . the majority of neutralizing antibodies are directed against this region of the s protein. antibodies raisedsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) first emerged in the human population in november 2002. phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov isolates from animals indicated that this virus most probably originated from bats, was transmitted first to palm civets and subsequently to humans at the wet markets in southern china. subsequent outbreaks occurred early 2003 in hong kong, hanoi, toronto, and singapore, and could be directly traced back to one index patient who acquired the infection in guangdong and traveled to hong kong. a worldwide epidemic was halted through the efforts of the world health organization, which responded rapidly to this threat by issuing a global alert, rigorous local containment efforts, warning against unnecessary travel to affected areas, and by creating a network of international experts to combat this virus. in the end only 8096 people became ill, and 774 people died in this first sars epidemic. because sars-cov could re-emerge and cause another epidemic at any time, development of effective vaccines remains of vital importance.although several infectious agents, including chlamydia, influenza a subtype h5n1, and human metapneumovirus, were considered as a possible cause of sars, three groups independently reported the isolation of a previously unrecognized cov from clinical specimens of sars patients ( peiris et al., 2003 ; rota et al., 2003 ; drosten et al., 2003 ) .through electron microscopy, serology, and reversetranscription pcr with consensus-and randomprimers, and subsequent sequencing of the replicase gene, its identity could be revealed and consistently demonstrated in clinical specimens from patients with the disease but not in healthy controls. to conclusively establish a causal role for this cov, cynomolgous macaques were inoculated with a sars-cov isolate. because the disease in macaques caused by sars-cov infection was pathologically similar to that seen in human patients with sars, and since the virus should induce highly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies to protect against newly emerging viruses related to sars-cov and protect both the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract in the absence of significant side effects. given the fact that in the previous outbreak mainly the elderly succumbed to the infection, special attention should be given to vaccines that are able to efficiently protect aged individuals. protein also inhibit sars-cov replication in vitro but their relevance in protection remains unclear. the genome also encodes two large poly-proteins with diverse enzymatic activities needed for efficient replication and several accessory proteins with unknown function (3b, 6, 8a, 8b, and 9b).at the end of 2004, 30 countries reported a total of 8096 probable cases of sars ( fig. 36.2 ) . pathogenic sars-covs do not circulate in the human population at the moment, but their re-emergence from animal reservoirs may likely occur in the future. because many of the early sars patients in guandong had epidemiological links to the live-animal market trade, different animal species were tested for the presence of sars-like viruses. soon after the outbreak, a sars-like coronavirus, which had more than 99% homology with human sars-cov, was detected by rt-pcr in the nasal and fecal swabs of palm civets ( paguma larvata ) and a raccoon dog ( nyctereutes procyonoides ) ( guan et al., 2003 ) . more recent studies indicate that bats may potentially act as natural reservoirs for sars-like covs ( li et al., 2005b ; lau et al., 2005 ) . however, sequence comparison of the s protein genes from bat sars-like cov and palm civet sars-like cov revealed only 64% genetic homology. subsequent studies by tang et al. (2006) have demonstrated that approximately 6% of bats sampled in china were positive for covs. interestingly, these covs are genetically diverse and many bat covs clustered with existing group 1 viruses, while others formed a separate lineage that included only viruses from bats (putative group 5). other sars-cov like viruses clustered in a putative group 4 consisting of two subgroups, one of bat covs and another of sars-covs from humans and other mammalian hosts. however, from these studies the direct progenitor of the sars-cov isolated from palm civets has not been identified. major genetic variations in the s protein gene of these viruses from civet cats, seemed essential for the transition from animal-to-human transmission epidemiology figure 36.2 reported suspected sars cases from november 1, 2002 to july 31, 2003 (data from the world health organization, http:// www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html ). countries with ͼ 5 suspected cases are indicated. patients. in fact, none of the sars-cov-infected children aged below 12 years in hong kong required intensive care or mechanical ventilation ( ng et al., 2004 ) . this is not totally explained by comorbid factors but similar age dependence in mortality is seen in patients with other (nonviral) causes of acute respiratory stress syndrome ( rubenfeld et al., 2005 ) . second, virus transmission is low in the first days of illness and peaks around day 10 after disease onset ( chu et al., 2004 ) . finally, several studies revealed that high viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate was found to be an independent predictor of mortality ( hung et al., 2004 ; chu et al., 2004 ) . therefore, vaccine strategies aimed at reducing the viral load may suffice to provide clinical benefit.the first efforts to treat sars patients were mainly based on the use of ribavirin and corticosteroids. ribavirin, which targets imp dehydrogenase, has been known a long time as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. however, current data do not support the use of ribavirin for sars treatment; in vitro studies did not show significant antiviral activity ( cinatl et al., 2003 ) and ribavirin enhanced the infectivity of sars-cov in mice ( barnard et al., 2006 ) . on the other hand, a protective effect of interferon (ifn)-α has been observed in a preliminary study during the sars outbreak ( loutfy et al., 2003 ) . these results are in concordance with several studies that noted antiviral activity in vitro ( cinatl et al., 2003 ; hensley et al., 2004 ) and animal studies showing that pegylated ifn-α effectively reduced sars-cov replication and excretion, viral antigen expression by type 1 pneumocytes and the pulmonary damage in cynomolgous macaques that were infected experimentally with sars-cov ( haagmans et al., 2004 ) . however, despite an extensive literature reporting on sars treatments, it is not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the sars outbreak. because of variation in treatment regimens-particularly the wide range in doses, duration of therapy, and route of administration of ribavirin and corticosteroids, no clear conclusion can be drawn regarding the efficacy of the drugs tested ( stockman et al., 2006 ) . in the event of a future outbreak of sars-cov or another novel agent, attempts should be made to develop treatment protocols, organize randomized trials and to collect and contribute information for a standardized minimum dataset that could facilitate analysis of treatment outcomes among different settings ( stockman et al., 2006 ) . to human-to-human transmission, which eventually caused the sars outbreak of 2002-2003.there is at present no evidence for the virus persisting in the human population. possible options for the re-emergence of sars include the escape of the virus from laboratories, which has already occurred on three occasions. the re-emergence of the virus from its animal reservoir remains possible, given that the virus is detectable in the feces and respiratory secretions of some animals. indeed, sars-cov re-emerged in four patients in guangdong in december 2003, although these sars-like covs caused milder clinical disease ( liang et al., 2004 ) . the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases biodefense network classified sars-cov as a category c priority pathogen pointing out that sars-cov could be a potential biothreat agent.the clinical symptoms of sars-cov infection are those of lower respiratory tract disease and include fever, malaise, peripheral t cell lymphocytopenia, decreased platelet counts, prolonged coagulation profiles, and mildly elevated serum hepatic enzymes ( peiris et al., 2004 ; li et al., 2004 ) . chest radiography reveals infiltrates with subpleural consolidation or " ground glass " changes compatible with viral pneumonitis. around 20−30% of individuals with sars require management in intensive care units and the overall case:fatality rate reached approximately 10%.although the main clinical symptoms are those of severe respiratory illness, sars-cov actually also causes a gastrointestinal and urinary tract infection; sars-cov can be detected in the feces and urine of patients, and electron microscopic studies of biopsies of the upper and lower intestinal mucosae of patients with sars confirmed the presence of the virus in these tissues ( peiris et al., 2004 ) . fecal transmission proved to be important in at least one major community outbreak in hong kong (amoy gardens), in which over 300 patients were infected within a few days.three features of sars may be relevant for intervention strategies. first, progressive age dependence in mortality and disease severity is observed in sarsthe major sources of transmission in humans are droplets that deposit on the respiratory epithelium. unlike the situation in several other respiratory viral infections, viral load of sars-cov in the upper respiratory tract peaked around day 10 after disease onset ( peiris et al., 2004 ) . therefore, virus transmission may be less efficient in the first days of illness, a finding supported by epidemiological observations. realtime pcr assays detect sars-cov during the first week in specimens of the lower respiratory tract (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, endotracheal aspirates), nasopharyngeal aspirate, throat swabs, and/or serum ( chan et al., 2004 ) , whereas fecal samples may show very high viral loads toward the end of the first week and second week of illness. in typical cases, which were largely confined to adult and elderly individuals, sars presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage and multiorgan dysfunction upon autopsy ( nicholls et al., 2003 ) . the pathological changes in lung alveoli most likely follow a common pathway characterized by an acute phase of proteinrich alveolar fluid influx into the alveolar lumina as a consequence of the injury to the alveolar wall. subsequently type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia takes place to replace the loss of infected type-1 pneumocytes and to cover the denuded epithelial basement membrane, resulting in restoration of the normal alveolar architecture. severe alveolar injury may lead to fibrosis with loss of alveolar function in more protracted cases ( fig. 36 .3 ).it has been hypothesized that the pathological changes observed in the lungs are initiated by a disproportional innate immune response, illustrated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as cxcl10 (ip-10), ccl2 (mcp-1), il-6, il-8, il-12, il-1 β , and ifn-γ ( huang et al., 2005 ; wong et al., 2004 ) . these in vivo data have been confirmed in vitro, demonstrating that sars-cov infection induces a range of cytokines and chemokines in diverse cell types law et al., 2005 ) . although in vitro studies argued that production of type i ifns is inhibited or delayed by sars-cov, in sars-covinfected macaques, and also early during sars in humans, type i ifns can be readily demonstrated (de lang et al., 2007) . because prophylactic treatment of macaques with pegylated ifn-α reduces sars-cov replication in the lungs, regulation of the production of ifns may be important in controlling sars ( haagmans et al., 2004 ) . based on the observation that sars-cov infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of antibodies directed against the s protein of sars-cov, a range of vaccines containing the s protein/gene has been developed. animals immunized with inactivated whole virus vaccines or live-recombinant vaccines expressing the sars-cov s protein (e.g., using rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus, or attenuated vaccinia virus mva as a vector), as well as mice immunized with dna vaccines expressing the s protein gene all developed neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov and were protected against sars-cov challenge. table 36 .1 displays an overview of vaccines that have been tested for efficacy in animal models.inactivated sars vaccines have been reported to elicit high titers of s protein-specific neutralizing antibodies. few studies, however, have addressed whether inactivated whole sars-cov virions confer protection from virus challenge. mice that were immunized twice with a candidate sars-cov vaccine, produced through a two-step inactivation procedure involving sequential formaldehyde and u.v. inactivation developed high-antibody titers against the sars-cov s protein and high levels of neutralizing antibodies ( spruth et al., 2006 ) (see chapter 11). moreover, the vaccine conferred protective immunity as demonstrated by prevention of sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract of mice after intranasal challenge with sars-cov. protection of mice was correlated to the antibody titer against the sars-cov s protein and neutralizing antibody titer. similar results have been obtained using a beta-propiolactone inactivated sars-cov vaccine in mice . in addition, two chinese groups have demonstrated protective efficacy of inactivated sars vaccines in rhesus monkeys ( qin et al., 2006 ; zhou et al., 2005 ) . a soluble recombinant polypeptide containing the n-terminal segment of the s glycoprotein may suffice to induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity in mice ( bisht et al., 2005 ) . in addition, a trimeric recombinant s protein was able to elicit an efficacious protective immune response in hamsters ( kam et al., 2007 ) .one of the most promising vaccine candidates is based on the combination of recombinant s protein with the protollin adjuvant. in both young and aged mice, an intranasal protollin-formulated s proteinseroconversion usually occurs in weeks 2 or 3 of illness and virus-neutralizing antibodies can be detected in convalescent human serum. in patients who had recovered from sars-neutralizing antibody titers peaked at month 4 but were undetectable in 16% of patients at month 36 ( cao et al., 2007 ) . neutralizing antibodies may be directed against different regions of the s protein (s1 and s2) as monoclonal antibodies against these epitopes exert potent neutralization of sars-cov in vitro ( sui et al., 2004 ; lip et al., 2006 ) . conversely, peptides which are located in these regions were able to induce neutralizing antibodies ( bisht et al., 2005 ; keng et al., 2005 ; zhang et al., 2004 ) .although experiments in diverse animal models have revealed that relatively low levels of neutralizing antibodies exert potent protection against lower respiratory tract infection, the neutralizing antibody titer necessary to achieve protection in humans exposed to sars-cov is not known. a concern in case of reemergence of sars is the possible absence of cross protection against these viruses. however, recent studies by he et al. (2006) have shown that the some neutralizing epitopes of sars-cov have been maintained during cross-species transmission, suggesting that receptor binding domain-based vaccines may induce broad protection against both human and animal sars-cov variants.in most sars autopsies, extensive necrosis of the spleen and atrophy of the white pulp with severe lymphocyte depletion have been observed. on the other hand, rapid phase in peripheral lymphocyte recovery usually coincided with improved clinical conditions of sars patients (peiris et al., 2004) . long-lived memory t cell responses against sars-cov nucleocapsid and s protein have been demonstrated in recovered sars patients, although their relevance in antiviral protection is not well understood peng et al., 2006 ; li et al., 2006 ) . however, despite potent immune responses and clinical recovery, peripheral lymphocyte counts in the recovered patients were not restored to normal levels .interestingly, mice that lack nk-t cells, or nk cells, or t and b cells all cleared the virus by day 9 after infection ( glass et al., 2004 ) . these data argue that cell-mediated immune responses are not essential to control virus clearance. vaccine elicited high levels of antigen-specific igg in serum and significant levels of antigen-specific lung iga ( hu et al., 2007 ) . in contrast, mice immunized intramuscularly with alum absorbed s protein did not develop detectable iga responses. following virus challenge of the aged mice, no virus was detected in the lungs of mice vaccinated intranasally, whereas intramuscularly immunized mice did not show significant control of virus replication compared to controls ( hu et al., 2007 ) .a dna vaccine encoding the s glycoprotein of the sars-cov induces t cell, neutralizing antibody responses, and protective immunity in a mouse model . these authors also demonstrated that antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector encoding a form of s protein that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing antibodies. viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these s protein plasmid dna expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral, but not a t-cell-dependent, immune mechanism. subsequent studies using a prime-boost combination of dna and whole killed sars-cov vaccines elicited higher antibody responses than dna or whole killed virus vaccines alone . apart from this study, several other groups have analyzed the immunogenicity of sars dna vaccines but none of these challenged the vaccinated animals with sars-cov.adenovirus-vector based vaccination strategies against sars-cov were employed early on after the sars outbreak to demonstrate that vaccinated rhesus macaques developed virus-neutralizing antibody responses against fragment s1 of the s protein and t cell responses against the nucleocapsid ( gao et al., 2003 ) . more recently, see et al. (2006) demonstrated that vaccination of c57b/l6 mice with adenovirus type 5-expressing s and nucleocapsid administered intranasally, but not intramuscularly, significantly limited sars-cov replication in the lungs. vaccines reduction in pulmonary sars-cov titer compared with control animals ( dinapoli et al., 2007 ) . finally, venezuelan equine encephalitis virus based vaccines have been tested extensively in young and aged mice. most importantly, different recombinant sars-cov bearing epidemic and zoonotic s protein variants were used to challenge the vaccinated mice. venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles expressing the 2003 epidemic urbani sars-cov strain s glycoprotein but not particles containing the nucleocapsid protein from the same strain provided complete short-and long-term protection against homologous strain challenge in young and senescent mice ( deming et al., 2006 ) . although the s protein encoding vaccine provided complete short-term protection against heterologous (strain gd03) challenge in young mice, only limited protection was seen in vaccinated senescent animals. interestingly, nucleocapsid-encoding vaccines not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge but also resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of sars-covchallenged mice ( deming et al., 2006 ) .a new generation of vaccines may be obtained from manipulating the full-length infectious cdna clone of sars-cov. one approach would be to delete the orfs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, or 9b similar to other coronavirus mutants generated previously; some mouse hepatitis or feline infectious peritonitis deletion viruses replicate to the same extent as wild-type viruses in vitro but are severely attenuated in vivo making them potential vaccine candidates. however, sars-cov deletion mutants lacking orfs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, or 7b, grew similar to that of the parental wild-type virus in the mouse model ( yount et al., 2005 ) . on the other hand, a recombinant sars-cov that lacks the e gene was attenuated both in vitro and in vivo . viable recombinant virus with the e gene deleted was recovered in vero cells with a titer around 10 6 pfu/ml but titers in the respiratory tract of hamsters were 100-1000-fold reduced compared to wild-type sars-cov replication, suggesting that this mutant is attenuated. multiplication of these viruses in packaging cell lines would provide the missing protein in trans and would make a promising sars-cov vaccine candidate that has the e gene deleted.live attenuated virus vaccines may revert to wildtype and recombine with other circulating human or the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) has been used to express the s glycoprotein of sars-cov in vaccination experiments using mouse, ferret, and rhesus monkey models ( bisht et al., 2004 ; chen et al., 2005 ; weingartl et al., 2004 ) . intranasal and intramuscular administration of mva encoding the sars-cov s protein led to the induction of a humoral immune response in balb/c mice, as well as reduced viral titers in the respiratory tract ( bisht et al., 2005 ) .recombinant bovine-human parainfluenza virus type 3 vector (bhpiv3) is being developed as a live attenuated, intranasal pediatric vaccine against human parainfluenza virus type 3. immunization of african green monkeys with a single dose of bhpiv3 expressing sars-cov s protein administered via the respiratory tract induced the production of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies . a recombinant bhpiv3 expressing sars-cov structural protein (s, m, and n) individually or in combination has been evaluated for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in hamsters . in the absence of s protein, expression of m, n, or e did not induce a detectable serum sars-cov-neutralizing antibody response and no protection against sars-cov challenge in the respiratory tract, whereas the vectors expressing the s protein induced neutralizing antibody responses and protection.recombinant rabies virus expressing the s protein of sars-cov induced a neutralizing antibody response in mice ( faber et al., 2005 ) . similarly, an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus vector that encodes the sars-cov s protein may be used to induce neutralizing antibody responses ( kapadia et al., 2005 ) . mice vaccinated with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing s protein developed sars-cov-neutralizing antibody and were able to control a challenge with sars-cov performed at either 1 month or 4 months after a single vaccination. in addition, by passive antibody transfer experiments these authors demonstrated that the antibody response induced by the vaccine was sufficient to control sars-cov infection.the efficacy of these vectors was further demonstrated in studies using aged mice. in aged mice, vaccinated with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing s protein, antibody titers induced were sufficient to protect them against subsequent challenge with sars-cov ( vogel et al., 2007 ) .african green monkeys immunized via the respiratory tract with two doses of a recombinant newcastle disease virus encoding the s protein developed a relatively high titer of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies and upon challenge demonstrated a 1000-fold zoonotic coronaviruses. in order to prevent this, it has been proposed to delete an essential gene, located in a position distant from gene e, and the relocation of the deleted gene to the position previously occupied by gene e ( enjuanes et al., 2008 ) . a potential recombination leading to the rescue of gene e would lead to the loss of the essential gene. alternatively, the transcriptional regulatory sequences (trs) of a vaccine virus could be genetically manipulated to a sequence incompatible with the trs of any known circulating coronavirus as described by yount et al. (2006) . this virus could be further modified by building attenuating mutations on the genetic backbone of the recombination resistant trs rewired virus either for use as a safe high titer seed stock for making killed vaccines or as a live virus vaccine. one such attenuating mutation could be targeted to the nonstructural protein 1. recombinant mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) encoding a deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence grew normally in tissue culture but was severely attenuated in vivo ( züst et al., 2007 ) . low doses of nsp1 mutant mhv elicited potent cytotoxic t cell responses and protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenge. this attenuation strategy provides a new paradigm for the development of highly efficient coronavirus vaccines.although several types of vectored vaccines have been developed, several companies favored the classical approach using inactivated whole virus to develop a vaccine to be used for preclinical testing (see chapter 11). methods in place for the production of available vaccines could be easily used using wellestablished technologies. in the preclinical development stage, it is preferable that different animal species are used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines.overall, a wide range of animal species, including rodents (mice and hamsters), carnivores (ferrets and cats), and nonhuman primates (cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, common marmosets, and african green monkeys) can be experimentally infected with sars-cov roberts et al., 2005b ; martina et al., 2003 ; kuiken et al., 2003 ; mcauliffe et al., 2004 ; haagmans and osterhaus, 2006 ) . most species show no clinical signs of disease, although the virus replicates efficiently in respiratory tissues. aged mice and ferrets on the other hand, show signs of clinical disease, albeit in the absence of the typical lung lesions seen in humans with sars ( roberts et al., 2005a ) . in contrast, inoculation of sars-cov in the respiratory tract of cynomolgus macaques causes infection of bronchial epithelial cells and type-1 pneumocytes 1-4 days postinfection, followed by extensive type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia in the lungs at 4-6 days postinfection haagmans and osterhaus, 2006 ) . the lesions, consisting of multiple foci of acute diffuse alveolar damage and characterized by flooding of alveoli with protein-rich edema fluid mixed with variable numbers of neutrophils, are quite similar to those observed in humans in the acute stages of sars.remarkably, vaccine candidates tested in ferrets showed reduced efficacy. vaccination with mva encoding the s protein induced only moderate antibody responses and consequently did not protect against intranasal sars-cov infection and even resulted in an inflammatory response in the livers of the vaccinated ferrets (weingartl et al., 2004) . whether these aberrant responses resulted from immunopathological mechanisms, like antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, or represented recall responses to viral antigen in the liver is not clear at the moment but deserves further investigation. in addition, limited protection from sars-cov challenge was observed in ferrets vaccinated with inactivated whole virus ( darnell et al., 2007 ) . two out of four ferrets showed little or no neutralizing antibody even after the second immunization and none of the vaccinated ferrets were able to reduce virus excretion at day 2 after challenge but subsequently cleared the virus more rapidly compared to control animals. adenovirus-based vaccines tested in ferrets seemed more powerful as they protected the lower respiratory tract efficiently but had less effect on virus excretion in the upper respiratory tract ( kobinger et al., 2007 ) .five years after the first sars outbreak a range of candidate vaccines have been developed. early in 2006 some companies in china and the us initiated phase 1 trials. the first clinical trial has been initiated by a chinese company, sinovac biotech of beijing in collaboration with the chinese academy of medical sciences using an inactivated whole virus vaccine. to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine, 36 subjects received two doses of vaccine or placebo control. on day 42, all individuals showed seroconversion and peak titers of neutralizing antibodies were reached 2 weeks after the second vaccination followed clinical trials iii. virus vaccines with a type i coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv), when subsequently exposed to fipv infection ( weiss and scott, 1981 ) . macrophages are able to take up feline coronavirus-antibody complexes more efficiently causing the virus to replicate to higher titers. interestingly, one study also demonstrated that antibodies against human sars-cov isolates enhance entry of pseudo-typed viruses expressing the civet cat sars-like cov s protein into cells, but not replication ( yang et al., 2005 ) . to date, there is no evidence for enhanced replication following sars-cov challenge in previously immunized animals.one other problem which may arise after vaccination with whole inactivated virus when absorbed with certain adjuvants such as alum, could relate to the induction of skewed th2 recall responses similar to what has been observed in children vaccinated with inactivated respiratory syncytial and measles virus vaccines.although much effort has been focused on developing a sars vaccine, the commercial viability of developing a vaccine for sars-cov will ultimately depend on whether the virus re-emerges in the near future. it is questionable whether possible future outbreaks will cause major outbreaks but vaccines, antivirals, or passive immunization would be relevant in the context of protecting high-risk individuals such as laboratory and health-care workers.• five years after the first sars outbreak, several candidate sars-cov vaccines are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development.• based on the observation that sars-cov infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of antibodies directed against the s protein of sars-cov, vaccines encoding this protein have been developed.• animals immunized with diverse vaccines containing the s protein or s protein gene developed sars-cov-neutralizing antibodies and were protected against sars-cov challenge.• future challenges for the development of sars-cov vaccines are linked to the potential re-emergence of this virus. vaccines able to induce highly cross-reactive antibodies which efficiently protect the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract are needed. given the fact that in the previous outbreak mainly elderly humans succumbed to the infection, special attention should be given to protect specifically these individuals. by a significant decline 4 weeks later ( lin et al., 2007 ) . several other candidate sars vaccines are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development.in sars patients who recover, high levels of neutralizing antibody responses are observed, suggesting that antibody responses play a role in determining the ultimate disease outcome of sars-cov-infected patients . although attempts have been made to test the efficacy of serum preparations from seroconvalescent sars patients in the acute phase of sars, no conclusive evidence has been obtained regarding their efficacy. in mice, on the other hand, sars-cov infection is efficiently controlled upon passive transfer of convalescent immunoglobulines . the concept that antibodies protect against sars has been further explored through the generation of human monoclonal antibodies against sars-cov. prophylactic administration of a human monoclonal antibody reduced replication of sars-cov in the lungs of infected ferrets by 1000-fold, completely prevented the development of sars-cov-induced macroscopic lung pathology, and abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions ( ter meulen et al., 2004 ) . in subsequent studies, several other monoclonal antibodies were evaluated for their efficacy in mouse and hamster models ( sui et al., 2005 ; traggiai et al., 2004 ) .the importance of assessing immunogenicity of candidate sars-cov vaccines using virus neutralization assays is well acknowledged, but the variety of these tests in use is a significant problem since there is at this time no consensus on the most sensitive, specific, and reproducible assay system. to compare data from each of the candidate vaccines requires international standardization of the immunological assays and the availability of an antibody standard used for the evaluation of these vaccines. to test cross reactivity of antibodies generated by vaccination, murine leukemia virus was used to generate infectious particles containing different s proteins ( giroglou et al., 2004 ) .enhanced disease and mortality have been observed in kittens immunized against or infectedsars-cov-2, the causal agent of covid-19, first emerged in late 2019 in china. it has since infected more than 870,000 individuals and caused more than 43,000 deaths globally. here, we discuss therapeutic and prophylactic interventions for sars-cov-2 with a focus on vaccine development and its challenges. vaccines are being rapidly developed but will likely come too late to affect the first wave of a potential pandemic. nevertheless, critical lessons can be learned for the development of vaccines against rapidly emerging viruses. importantly, sars-cov-2 vaccines will be essential to reducing morbidity and mortality if the virus establishes itself in the population.on december 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in wuhan, china. the outbreak had started in early december or november , and the number of cases rose quickly; more than 80,000 infections were reported in china as of march 15, 2020, including more than 3,000 deaths. at the time of this review (april 6, 2020), the disease, termed covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), had become pandemic and spread to more than 203 countries and territories, including community transmission in countries like the united states, germany, france, spain, japan, singapore, south korea, iran, and italy and a large-scale outbreak with more than 600 cases on the cruise ship diamond princess. as of april 1, more than 870,000 cases and 43,000 deaths had been reported globally, with rapid growth of numbers in many countries. the causative agent of the outbreak was swiftly identified as betacoronavirus with a genomic sequence closely related to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus from 2003, earning the new virus the name sars-cov-2 (gorbalenya et al., 2020; wu et al., 2020; zhou et al., 2020; zhu et al., 2020) . sars-cov-2 likely originated in bats but might have been amplified in an intermediate host. initial work showed that it can use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) from bats, civet cats, swine, cats, ferrets, non-human primates (nhps), and humans as a receptor (letko et al., 2020; wan et al., 2020; zhou et al., 2020) . transmission of the infection to a pet dog in hong kong suggests that canine ace2 can also be recognized by sars-cov-2. pangolins, protected animals that are traded illegally in asia and elsewhere, have been proposed as a potential amplifying host by some studies (lam et al., 2020; zhang et al., 2020) . the initial reports from china and elsewhere note that although most covid-19 cases present mild to moderate pathology, approximately 20% percent of cases are severe guan et al., 2020; huang et al., 2020; novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team, 2020; wang et al., 2020) . the case fatality rate (cfr) seems to be age dependent, with a higher percentage in the elderly, especially men, and an overall interim cfr of approximately 1%-3%. the number of individuals with undetected, mild cases could be much higher than the official case number, which would lead to a lower infection fatality rate (irf). south korea, a country that put a massive effort into testing and has already tested tens of thousands of samples, reports much lower cfrs than countries without extensive testing like spain, iran, or the united states. the cfr is disproportionally high in italy (currently 7.3%), likely because of a large number of mild cases missed combined with a relatively older population and a healthcare system that is overwhelmed with cases. the reproductive number (r 0 ) of the infection, that is, the number of cases directly generated by one case in a population in which all individuals are susceptible to infection, is estimated to be 2-3 . given the severity of the disease, which in most age groups is above that of seasonal influenza or pandemic h1n1 (2009) influenza, vaccines and therapeutics to tackle this novel virus are urgently needed.coronaviruses, in brief sars-cov-2 is part of the coronaviridae family, whose members are named after their crown-like appearance under the electron microscope caused by the surface glycoproteins that decorate the virus. the family includes two subfamilies: letovirinae and orthocoronavirinae. orthocoronavirinae includes the genera alphacoronvirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses typically infect only mammals, whereas gammacoronoviruses and deltacoronaviruses typically infect avian species and sometimes mammals (cui et al., 2019) . coronaviruses are common human pathogens; two types of alphacoronaviruses (229e and nl63) and two types of betacoronaviruses (oc43 and hku1) circulate in humans and cause common cold. more pathogenic coronaviruses for humans include sars-cov-1, the middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), and now sars-cov-2, which are all betacoronaviruses.coronaviruses have a large (30+ kb) single-stranded positivesense rna genome encoding for several open reading frames. one frame encodes the spike protein (s protein), a class i fusion protein that mediates attachment of the virus to cell surface receptors followed by uptake into endosomes (for most coronaviruses). proteolytic cleavage of the s protein and fusion of viral and endosomal membranes trigger release of viral rna into the cytosol (reviewed in fehr and perlman, 2015) . the rna contains a 5 0 cap structure and a 3 0 poly(a) tail that allows expression of the replicase, which is encoded by approximately two-thirds of the genome. the other third codes for the structural and accessory proteins. the replicase is expressed as two polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab; these include up to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). the nsps are generated by processing of pp1a and pp1ab by 2-3 viral proteases encoded within the replicase. many nsps then assemble into the replicase-transcriptase complex that-in the host cell cytosol-produces anti-sense genome, new viral genome, and subgenomic rna that serves as mrna. structural proteins s, matrix (m) protein, and envelope (e) are then generated and inserted into the endoplasmatic reticulum and follow the secretory pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment (ergic) . a minority of coronaviruses also encode a hemagglutinin esterase (he). in many coronaviruses, the s protein is cleaved into two subunits, s1 and s2, often by furin-like proteases. the rna genome associates with nucleoprotein and then buds into the ergic, forming virus particles. after assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and are exocytosed. several accessory proteins, which seem to be important for pathogenesis, are also expressed but not all are functionally characterized.clinical trials with the nucleotide analog remdesivir (clinical-trials.gov: nct04257656, nct04252664, nct04280705, etc.) and protease inhibitors (clinicaltrials.gov: nct04255017, nct04276688, etc.), as well as other treatment options, are ongoing in china and the united states, and trial results are expected within weeks. remdesivir works against coronaviruses closely related to sars-cov-2 in animal models, as well as against the related mers-cov, including in nhps (agostini et al., 2018; brown et al., 2019; de wit et al., 2020; sheahan et al., 2017 sheahan et al., , 2020 . remdesivir was also tested for treatment of ebolavirus infections in humans (and found to be less successful than other treatments by mulangu et al., 2019) ; therefore, safety data exist for this therapeutic agent, which should accelerate the process of clinical testing against sars-cov-2. remdesivir's mechanism of action as a nucleotide analog is not clear, but it likely terminates rna synthesis, leads to incorporation mutagenesis, or both (agostini et al., 2018) . in addition, a combination of the two licensed hiv inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, is also being tested in clinical trials (e.g., clinicaltrials.gov: nct04264858, etc.). lopinavir is a bona fide protease inhibitor, whereas ritonavir was initially designed as protease inhibitor but was found to boost the half-life of lopinavir by inhibiting cytochrome p450 (hull and montaner, 2011) . the combination was compassionately used as treatment for sars-cov-1 in 2003-2004 and showed some promise (chu et al., 2004) . effectiveness of the combination was limited in mice but appreciable in nhp models of mers-cov (chan et al., 2015; sheahan et al., 2020) . the mechanism of action of lopinavir is not clear, but it likely inhibits one or more coronavirus proteases. other treatment options with ongoing or planned clinical trials include dosing recombinant human ace2 to neutralize the virus and prevent lung damage (clinicaltrials.gov: nct04287686) and using the antiviral arbidol, a fusion inhibitor (kadam and wilson, 2017; teissier et al., 2011) . another interesting option is the use of convalescent serum as treatment; clinical trials to test this are ongoing in china (clinical-trials.gov: nct04264858, placebo control, not recruiting yet), and compassionate use of this strategy has recently started in the us (e.g. at mount sinai medical center, ny). similarly, polyclonal human immunoglobulin g (igg) derived from transgenic cows could be used, because this strategy has been successful for mers-cov in animal models (luke et al., 2016) and has been tested for safety in clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov: nct02788188). many of these trials will have results within months, and if remdesivir (produced by gilead) and/or lopinavir plus ritonavir (produced by abbvie as kaletra and aluvia, respectively) show effectiveness, they could potentially be used widely within a short time frame. compassionate use of these drugs has already been reported for sars-cov-2 infections (holshue et al., 2020; lim et al., 2020) .during the 2009 h1n1 influenza virus pandemic, vaccine producers switched their production pipelines quickly from producing trivalent seasonal influenza virus vaccines to monovalent pandemic vaccines. this was basically just a change of strains and established and approved processes, established release criteria, and existing correlates of protection could be used (krammer and palese, 2015) . still, it took six months until the vaccine was ready to be distributed and used, and it came too late to affect the second pandemic wave, which took place in the united states in fall 2009. this time, we are facing a new challenge in the form of a virus that has just emerged in humans, and the response will be more complex because there are no existing vaccines or production processes for coronavirus vaccines.vaccine technology has significantly evolved in the last decade, including the development of several rna and dna vaccine candidates, licensed vectored vaccines (e.g., ervebo, a vesicular stomatitis virus [vsv]-vectored ebolavirus vaccine, licensed in the european union), recombinant protein vaccines (e.g., flublok, an influenza virus vaccine made in insect cells, licensed in the united states), and cell-culture-based vaccines (e.g., flucelvax, an influenza virus vaccine made in mammalian cells). sars-cov-2 was identified in record time, and its genomic sequence was swiftly made widely available by chinese researchers zhou et al., 2020; zhu et al., 2020) . in addition, we know from studies on sars-cov-1 and the related mers-cov vaccines that the s protein on the surface of the virus is an ideal target for a vaccine. in sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2, this protein interacts with the receptor ace2, and antibodies targeting the spike can interfere with this binding, thereby neutralizing the virus (figure 1 ). the structure of the s protein of sars-cov-2 was solved in record time at high resolution, contributing to our understanding of this vaccine target (lan et al., 2020a; wrapp et al., 2020) . therefore, we have a target antigen that can be incorporated into advanced vaccine platforms.several vaccines for sars-cov-1 were developed and tested in animal models, including recombinant s-protein-based vaccines, attenuated and whole inactivated vaccines, and vectored vaccines (roper and rehm, 2009 ). most of these vaccines protect animals from challenge with sars-cov-1, although many do not induce sterilizing immunity. in some cases, vaccination with the live virus results in complications, including lung damage and infiltration of eosinophils in a mouse model (e.g., bolles et al., 2011; tseng et al., 2012) and liver damage in ferrets (e.g., weingartl et al., 2004) . in another study, vaccination with inactivated sars-cov-1 led to enhancement of disease in one nhp, whereas it protected 3 animals from challenge (wang et al., 2016) . the same study identified certain epitopes on the s protein as protective, whereas immunity to others seemed to be enhancing disease. however, in almost all cases, vaccination is associated with greater survival, reduced virus titers, and/or less morbidity compared with that in unvaccinated animals. similar findings have been reported for mers-cov vaccines (agrawal et al., 2016; houser et al., 2017) . therefore, whereas vaccines for related coronaviruses are efficacious in animal models, we need to ensure that the vaccines, which are developed for sars-cov-2, are sufficiently safe.another consideration for effective coronavirus vaccine development might be waning of the antibody response. infection with human coronaviruses does not always induce long-lived antibody responses, and re-infection of an individual with the same virus is possible after an extended period of time (but only in a fraction of individuals and resulting in mild or no symtpoms), as shown in human challenge studies (callow et al., 1990) . antibody titers in individuals that survived sars-cov-1 or mers-cov infections often waned after 2-3 years (liu et al., 2006; wu et al., 2007) or were weak initially (choe et al., 2017) . despite that, re-infections are unlikely in the short term. of note, re-infections after days of recovery have been reported recently but appear to be the consequences of false negative test results (lan et al., 2020b) . however, they could happen when humoral immunity wanes over months and years. an effective sars-cov-2 vaccine will need to overcome these issues to protect in a scenario in which the virus becomes endemic and causes recurrent seasonal epidemics.sars-cov-2 infection causes the most severe pathology in individuals above 50 years of age. the reason for this is not clear, but many viral infections have milder manifestations in naive younger individuals than in naive older individuals. because older individuals are more affected, it will be important to develop vaccines that protect this segment of the population. unfortunately, older individuals typically respond less well to vaccination because of immune senescence (sambhara and mcelhaney, 2009 ). for influenza, which is problematic for older adults, specific formulations for this segment of the population include more antigen or an adjuvant (diazgranados et al., 2013; tsai, 2013) . protection in older individuals appears to require higher neutralization titers against influenza virus than in younger individuals (benoit et al., 2015) , and this issue might need to be addressed for sars-cov-2. if vaccination in older individuals is not effective, they could still benefit indirectly if vaccination is able to stop transmission of the virus in younger individuals.only a small number of sars-cov-1 vaccines made it to phase i clinical trials before funding dried up because of eradication of the virus from the human population through non-pharmaceutical interventions when case numbers were still small. results from these trials, performed with an inactivated virus vaccine and a spike-based dna vaccine, are encouraging because the vaccines were safe and induced neutralizing antibody titers (lin et al., 2007; martin et al., 2008) . some neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated against sars-cov-1, like cr3022 (ter meulen et al., 2006; tian et al., 2020) , can crossreact to the receptor binding domain of sars-cov-2. this suggests that sars-cov-1 vaccines might cross-protect against sars-cov-2. however, because these vaccines have not been developed further than phase i, they are currently not available for use. vaccines against mers-cov, also targeting the mers-cov s protein, are in pre-clinical and clinical development, including vaccines based on modified vaccinia ankara vectors, adenovirus vectors, and dna-based vaccines, and several of them are supported by the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovation (cepi) (yong et al., 2019) . however, it is unlikely that mers-cov vaccines induce strong cross-neutralizing antibodies to sars-cov-2 because of the phylogenetic the structure of a coronavirus particle is depicted on the left, with the different viral proteins indicated. the s protein is the major target for vaccine development. the spike structure shown is based on the trimeric sars-cov-1 spike (pdb: 5xl3). one trimer is shown in dark blue, and the receptor binding domain, a main target of neutralizing antibodies, is highlighted in purple. the other two trimers are shown in light blue. sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates based on different vaccine platforms have been developed, and for some of them, pre-clinical experiments have been initiated. for one mrna-based candidate, a clinical trial recently started to enroll volunteers shortly (clinicaltrials.gov: nct04283461). however, many additional steps are needed before these vaccines can be used in the population, and this process might take months, if not years. 1 for some candidates, cgmp processes have already been established. 2 clinical trial design might be altered to move vaccines through clinical testing quicker. distance between the two viruses. nevertheless, we can still learn a lot from these vaccines about how to move forward with sars-cov-2 vaccine design (pallesen et al., 2017) .the development of vaccines for human use can take years, especially when novel technologies are used that have not been extensively tested for safety or scaled up for mass production. because no coronavirus vaccines are on the market and no large-scale manufacturing capacity for these vaccines exists as yet (table 1) , we will need to build these processes and capacities. doing this for the first time can be tedious and time consuming (figure 1 ). cepi has awarded funds to several highly innovative players in the field, and many of them will likely succeed in eventually making a sars-cov-2 vaccine. however, none of these companies and institutions have an established pipeline to bring such a vaccine to late-stage clinical trials that allow licensure by regulatory agencies, and they do not currently have the capacity to produce the number of doses needed. an mrna-based vaccine, which expresses target antigen in vivo in the vaccinee after injection of mrna encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, co-developed by moderna and the vaccine research center at the national institutes of health, is currently the furthest along, and a phase i clinical trial recently started (clinicaltrials.gov: nct04283461). curevac is working on a similar vaccine but is still in the pre-clinical phase. additional approaches in the pre-clinical stage include recombinant-proteinbased vaccines (focused on the s protein, e.g., express2ion, ibio, novavax, baylor college of medicine, university of queensland, and sichuan clover biopharmaceuticals), viral-vectorbased vaccines (focused on the s protein, e.g., vaxart, geovax, university of oxford, and cansino biologics), dna vaccines (focused on the s protein, e.g., inovio and applied dna sciences), live attenuated vaccines (codagenix with the serum institute of india, etc.), and inactivated virus vaccines (figure 1 ; table 1 ). all of these platforms have advantages and disadvantages (table 1) , and it is not possible to predict which strategy will be faster or more successful. johnson & johnson (j&j) (johnson & johnson, 2020) and sanofi (2020) recently joined efforts to develop sars-cov-2 vaccines. however, j&j is using an experimental adenovirus vector platform that has not yet resulted in a licensed vaccine. sanofi's vaccine, to be made using a process similar to the process used for their approved flublok recombinant influenza virus vaccine (zhou et al., 2006) , is also months, if not years, from being ready for use in the human population. creating infectious clones for attenuated coronavirus vaccine seeds takes time because of large genome size. safety testing will need to be extensive.straightforward process used for several licensed human vaccines, existing infrastructure can be used, has been tested in humans for sars-cov-1, adjuvants can be used to increase immunogenicity.large amounts of infectious virus need to be handled (could be mitigated by using an attenuated seed virus). antigen and/or epitope integrity needs to be confirmed.why does this take so long? as mentioned earlier, there are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines. in addition, many technologies used (production platforms, vectors, etc.) are new and need to be tested thoroughly for safety. the target for the vaccine, the s protein, has been identified, and vaccine candidates are being generated. this is usually followed by two important steps that are typically needed before bringing a vaccine into clinical trials. first, the vaccine is tested in appropriate animal models to see whether it is protective. however, animal models for sars-cov-2 might be difficult to develop. the virus does not grow in wild-type mice and only induced mild disease in transgenic animals expressing human ace2 (bao et al., 2020) . other potential animal models include ferrets and nhps, for which pathogenicity studies are ongoing. even in the absence of an animal model that replicates human disease, it is possible to evaluate the vaccine because serum from vaccinated animals can be tested in in vitro neutralization assays. post-challenge safety data should also be collected in these cases to assess for complications such as the ones seen sars-cov-1 and mers-cov vaccines. second, vaccines need to be tested for toxicity in animals, e.g., in rabbits. usually, viral challenge is not part of this process, because only the safety of the vaccine will be evaluated. this testing, which has to be performed in a manner compliant with glp (good laboratory practice), typically takes 3-6 months to complete. for some vaccine platforms, parts of the safety testing might be skipped if there is already sufficient data available for similar vaccines made in the same production process. vaccines for human use are produced in processes that comply with current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) to ensure constant quality and safety of vaccines. this requires dedicated facilities, trained personnel, proper documentation, and raw material that was produced to be of cgmp quality. these processes have to be designed or amended to fit sars-cov-2 vaccines. for many vaccine candidates in the preclinical phase, such processes do not yet exist and have to be developed from scratch.once sufficient pre-clinical data are available and initial batches of the vaccine have been produced that are of cgmp quality, clinical trials might be initiated. typically, clinical development of vaccines starts with small phase i trials to evaluate the safety of vaccine candidates in humans. these are followed by phase ii trials (formulation and doses are established to initially prove efficacy) and finally by phase iii trials, in which the efficacy and safety of a vaccine need to be demonstrated in a larger cohort. however, in an extraordinary situation like the current one, this scheme might be compressed and an accelerated regulatory approval pathway might be developed. if efficacy is shown, a vaccine might be licensed by regulatory agencies.another important point is that production capacity to produce sufficient amounts of cgmp-quality vaccine needs to be available. for vaccines based on existing vaccine platforms, e.g., inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, this can be relatively easily achieved, because existing infrastructure can be used (table 1) . for vaccines based on novel technologies, e.g., mrna, this capacity needs to be built, and this typically takes time. although it would be beneficial if even a limited number of doses were available to protect health care workers and the most vulnerable seg-ments of the population, the goal should be to make vaccines available to the global population. this will be challenging. even for influenza virus vaccines, for which many production facilities exist in high-income countries, as well as low-and middle-income countries, the demand in the case of a pandemic would by far exceed the production capacity.finally, it takes time to distribute vaccines and administer them. to vaccinate a large proportion of the population would likely take weeks. given that the population is currently naive to sars-cov-2, it is highly likely that more than one dose of the vaccine will be needed. prime-boost vaccination regimens are typically used in such cases, and the two vaccinations are usually spaced 3-4 weeks apart. it is likely that protective immunity will be achieved only 1-2 weeks after the second vaccination. this therefore adds another 1-2 months to the timeline. even if shortcuts for several of the steps mentioned earlier can be found, it is unlikely that a vaccine would be available earlier than 6 months after the initiation of clinical trials. realistically, sars-cov-2 vaccines will not be available for another 12-18 months.what are potential solutions for these long time frames in the future? one possibility is to build production capacity, to be globally distributed if possible, that can be activated in the event of new emerging viruses. from today's perspective, only a few types of viruses are likely to cause respiratory disease that leads to rapid global spread. surveillance in the animal reservoir paired with virus characterization studies can identify members of virus families that have the potential to cause pandemics. vaccine candidates using these isolates could then be produced, tested in animals to determine the mechanisms of protection, and tested in humans to establish the safety of the vaccines. it is unlikely that the same viruses that are chosen as vaccine candidates will later cause outbreaks. however, if the vaccine candidate is sufficiently closely related, sequences for the vaccines could be quickly switched and the vaccines for the newly emerging viruses could be swiftly produced and moved to latestage clinical trials right away (while large-scale production is ramped up globally). in addition, stockpiled vaccines based on the initial candidates could be deployed, even if slightly mismatched to the strain causing the outbreak (a strategy that is currently used for h5 and h7 avian influenza virus vaccines). this would allow a response within a few weeks and could potentially stop a virus locally before it becomes pandemic. an alternative but challenging solution would be the development of broadly protective vaccines that cover whole virus families or genera. this effort is ongoing for influenza viruses (erbelding et al., 2018) and could potentially be applied to coronaviruses, or at least betacoronaviruses. both of these options are costly and require global political will and vision.considering the deep dive stock markets have taken in recent weeks and given the expected effect of a pandemic on the economy, funding for vaccine production infrastructure that would allow a swift response to emerging viruses looks like a great investment. however, without a pandemic looming, such investments have rarely been made in the past, except for h5 and h7 subtype influenza viruses. now would be the right time to consider investing in vaccines against emerging viruses that can lead to loss of human lives and burden the global economy.an investment of a few billion dollars would allow us to have sufficient surveillance, appropriate vaccine candidates, and infrastructure ready that could churn out vaccines for use in the global population quickly and effectively, potentially stopping an emerging virus in its tracks. in addition, we need well-developed emergency plans that allow us to develop, test, produce, and distribute vaccines within weeks, not months or years. this would need tight coordination among pharmaceutical companies, governments, regulatory agencies, and the world health organization (who), as well as novel and out-of-the-box approaches to cgmp production, release processes, regulatory science, and clinical trial design.for sars-cov-2, vaccines might come too late to affect the first wave of this pandemic. however, they might be useful if additional waves occur later or in a post-pandemic scenario in which sars-cov-2 continues to circulate as a seasonal virus. in addition, lessons learned from handling this outbreak will allow us to be better prepared in the future. the viruses will keep coming.we thank francesco berlanda-scorza for

this review describes coronavirus vaccine design targets, summarizes recent advances and potential strategies for coronavirus vaccine development, and highlights promising technological routes and adjuvants for improving the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines.in 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was found in humans 1 . on february 11, 2020, who announced a new name for the epidemic disease: corona virus disease . meanwhile, the international committee on taxonomy of viruses named the novel coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). as of may 16th, 2020, the epidemic of covid-19 has caused more than 4,400,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and more than 300,000 reported deaths 2 .covid-19 is the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease 3 sars is a zoonosis caused by sars-cov, which has infected 8096 humans, including 774 deaths (mortality rate 9.6%), in at least 29 countries 4 . another highly pathogenic coronavirus, mers-cov, has been reported in 27 countries with reported viral infection and 858 associated deaths (mortality rate 34.4%). 5 research indicates that sars-cov was transmitted from civet cats to humans and mers-cov was transmitted from dromedary camels to humans. however, the intermediate host of sars-cov-2 has not been identified 6, 7, 8 .sars-cov-2, together with sars-cov and mers-cov, has posed significant threats to international health due to theirs high pathogenicity and infectivity.vaccination is an important strategy to provide protection from infectious diseases.however, to date, no vaccine has been approved to prevent coronavirus infection, indicating the need for further development of novel and effective vaccines against coronavirus infection.in this review, we will illustrate vaccine design targets, review current advances and potential strategies for vaccine development based on the spike (s) protein of sars-cov and mers-cov, and focus on how to improve the efficacy of vaccines through adjuvant formulations. overall, these strategies may provide useful guidance for vaccine development of sars-cov-2.infections in animals and humans. according to the phylogenetic relationships, coronavirus can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta. alpha and beta genera can infect mammals, while gamma and delta genera are mostly avian coronaviruses 9 . there are seven known coronavirus that can infect humans: 229e, oc43, nl63, hku1, sars-cov, mers-cov and sars-cov-2. the first four viruses cause only mild minor respiratory illness. the other three strains-sars-cov, mers-cov and sars-cov-2-are zoonotic and lead to severe respiratory syndrome 10-12 . coronaviruses are the largest single positive-strand rna viruses with a genome of 27-32 kb 13 . it is named for its corona-like appearance ( sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 have strong human-to-human characteristics, which is attributed to the interaction between s protein and host cell surface receptors. sars-cov and sars-cov-2 use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as a receptor 15, 16 , whereas mers-cov uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4; also known as cd26) as a receptor 17 table   1 2-8,12,15-17 . s protein is a large type i transmembrane glycoprotein whose trimers constitute the spike structure on the surface of the virus. the s protein (fig. 1b) can be divided into two functional subunits: an n-terminal s1 domain contains signal peptide and receptor binding domain (rbd), and a c-terminal s2 domain contains fusion peptide and two heptapeptide repeats (hr1 and hr2) to facilitate viral fusion. rbd mediates the binding of virus and cell receptor, which then triggers a conformational change of the s protein, exposing hr1 and hr2 to form a 6-helix bundle fusion core structure, further leading to membrane fusion and viral rna release [18] [19] [20] [21] . furthermore, s protein carries b-cell epitopes, which induces the body to produce neutralizing antibody and provides immune protection 22 . because the s protein is involved in viral infection and is responsible for inducing host immune response and virus-neutralizing antibodies, it has been considered a key target for vaccine design.antigen-specific targets of s protein include full-length s protein, s1 subunits, rbd and s2 subunits. viral vector vaccines encoding full-length s protein or s1 subunits have been demonstrated to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in various animal models 23, 24 . however, some non-neutralizing epitopes on full-length s protein or s1 subunits may compete with neutralizing epitopes, leading to several safety concerns, including inflammatory and immunopathological effects such as pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration and antibody-dependent enhancement (ade)following subsequent viral challenge of vaccinated animals 22, 25, 26 . ade is a phenomenon in which non-neutralizing antibodies are produced following an infection or a vaccination leads to enhanced infection 27 . one approach to mitigate the adverse effects of ade is to narrow the immune response to target only critical or beneficial epitopes 28 . vaccines based on rbd elicited a robust protective immune response and neutralizing antibodies. at the same time, rbd does not contain non-neutralizing epitopes that may cause harmful immune responses, which is a hot spot for cov vaccine development. it is worth mentioning that rbd has relatively low immunogenicity and often requires repeated doses and adjuvants [29] [30] [31] . because the s2 subunit is highly conserved and not prone to mutation, s2 region has become an important target for the development of protective vaccines. however, reports regarding the presence of neutralizing epitopes in s2 and a protective role for antibodies to s2 have been inconsistent. several studies demonstrated that s2 domain could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total igg but little neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus infection 32, 33 . on the contrary, there are also reports that showed that s2 domain contains neutralizing epitopes and could induce neutralizing antibodies 34, 35 .n protein serves multiple functions in viral replication, transcription, and assembly of the viral genome complex, which is more conservative than other proteins, such as s and m. therefore, n protein has been also widely reported as a target antigen. n proteins have been shown to be highly immunogenic and capable of triggering t cell responses 36 . remarkably, many studies indicated that the serum containing anti-n protein does not contain neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus infection 37, 38 . in addition, vaccines based on n protein not only failed to protect from homologous or heterologous challenge, but resulted in enhanced immunopathology with eosinophilic infiltrates within the lungs of sars-cov-challenged mice 39 .it is critical for cov vaccines to induce robust humoral and cellular immunities. nucleic acid vaccines, including dna and rna vaccines, are based on plasmids or messenger rna that encode vaccine antigens, and they are introduced into the host to produce immunological response to protect organisms against diseases 59 induced durable immune responses, as most participants maintained detectable s1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination 63 . nevertheless, cov dna vaccines based on full-length s protein may cause a th2-related harmful immune response, leading to liver damage in vaccinated animals. one study comparing the immunogenicity of mers-cov dna vaccines expressing s or s1 in mice showed that plasmids expressing the s1 (ps1) subunit triggered a balanced th1/th2 response, thereby avoiding the risk of immunopathological risk associated with th2 response 64 . moreover, immunization of mice with ps1 vaccine induced significantly higher levels of ifn-γ compared to ps vaccine 64 .messenger rna (mrna) vaccines carry transcripts encoding antigens, and use the host cell translational machinery to produce the antigens, which then stimulates an immune response 65 . because of high yields of in vitro transcription reactions, mrna has the potential for rapid, inexpensive and scalable manufacturing, which greatly shortens the development time and can respond quickly to epidemics. compared to dna vaccines, mrna vaccines do not need to pass an additional membrane barrier (nuclear membrane), so it does not have safety concerns about integration into the host genome 66 . due to the above advantages, mrna vaccines are becoming a powerful tool against coronavirus infection.however, their application has been restricted by the instability and inefficient in vivo delivery of nucleic acid (dna or mrna) 67, 68 . to provide protection from degradation and facilitate their entry into targeted cells, efficient delivery systems for nucleic acid vaccines, particularly the nanocarriers, have been explored extensively.viral vectors have a molecular mechanism that assists the target gene to enter cells and infect them, which is an important vector platform for cov candidate vaccines. 71, 72 . furthermore, compared with mers-cov s-encoding ad5 vaccines, mers-cov s1-encoding ad5 vaccines might induce higher levels of neutralizing antibodies 73 . in a recent study, rad5 constructs expressing cd40-targeted s1 fusion protein (rad5-s1/f/cd40l) exhibited full protection against lethal mers-cov challenge, and prevented severe perivascular hemorrhage within the lungs as compared to non cd40-targeted vaccine (rad5-s1) 74 virus-like particles (vlps) are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and subunit vaccines are composed of highly purified antigens which require only a part of the pathogen to generate a protective immune response. subunit vaccines are characterized by high security, controllable performance and easy production on a large scale, thereby gradually becoming the focus of more and more researchers. table   2 highly purified proteins in subunit vaccines are usually not inherently immunogenic, as they generally do not directly stimulate the innate immune system. however, the development of effective cov vaccines requires the activation of powerful humoral and cellular immunity to induce protective immunity and virus clearance in the body.therefore, adjuvants are needed to be incorporated in subunit vaccines to enhance the immunogenicity of these weaker antigens and evoke the required antigen-specific immune response phenotype, thus improving the overall potency of poorly immunogenic subunit vaccines. the following review will discuss adjuvants commonly used in subunit vaccines against coronavirus infection.aluminum (alum) adjuvant is the longest and most frequently used adjuvant in licensed vaccines, with an extensive safety record. alum is a th2-type adjuvant that induces strong humoral immune response, including the production of neutralizing antibodies 86 . therefore, alum is incorporated into a range of vaccines against viral infection where neutralizing antibodies to viral antigens are required for protection, including human papillomavirus, rabies and hepatitis b 87 .aluminum adjuvant has been widely used in the development of cov vaccine due to a variety of advantages noted above. several studies have indicated that rbd-based subunit vaccines in the presence of alum induce powerful serum-specific and neutralizing antibodies, providing a degree of protection against viral challenges 85, 88 . it is noteworthy to mention that eliciting powerful cellular and humoral immunity is critical for a potential cov vaccine. virus-specific t cells can secrete ifn-γ and promote virus clearance. meanwhile, effector t cells can further differentiate into memory t cells, which is expected to respond quickly and effectively to subsequent cov infection 89, 90 . although alum successfully induces antibody-mediated protective immunity, its ability to induce cellular immune responses is limited. one approach to overcome the limitations of alum is to use it in combination with other adjuvants to enhance cellular immune responses.another approach that has an extensive history of use as cov vaccine adjuvants are emulsions. freund's adjuvant is a water-in-oil emulsion, divided into complete the innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns table   3 83, 85, 87, 88, [91] [92] [93] [94] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] 108, 109, 112, 113, 118, 122, 123, 125, 126, 128 . in addition to safety considerations, the design of adjuvants must also pay attention to the ability to selectively induce and regulate the types of immune responses in the body, so as to effectively promote the humoral and cellular immunity to combat coronavirus infection. it is also noteworthy to mention that an existing well-established adjuvant could be combined with new immunostimulants (e.g., tlrs agonist) to improve the breadth and intensity of the immune responses, which has become a potential strategy for exploring efficient adjuvant systems.sars-cov-2 has spread rapidly since its outbreak and has now posed a risk to there are no conflicts of interest to declare. 2. induces the production of type-i

previously as 2019-ncov pneumonia or disease, has emerged as a global public health crisis, joining severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) in a growing number of coronavirus-associated illnesses which have jumped from animals to people. there are at least seven identified coronaviruses that infect humans. in december 2019 the city of wuhan in china became the epicenter for an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2. sars-cov-2 was isolated and sequenced from human airway epithelial cells from infected patients 1, 2 . disease symptoms range from mild flu-like to severe cases with life-threatening pneumonia 3 . the global situation is dynamically evolving, and on 30 january 2020 the world health organization declared covid-19 as a public health emergency of international concern (pheic), and on 11 march 2020 it was declared a global pandemic. as of 1 may 2020 there are 3,321,402 people confirmed infected and 237,180 deaths 4 . infections have spread to multiple continents. human-to-human transmission has been observed in multiple countries, and a shortage of disposable personal protective equipment 5 , and prolonged survival times of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces 6 , have compounded this already delicate situation and heightened the risk of nosocomial infections. advanced research activities must be pursued in parallel to push forward protective modalities in an effort to protect billions of vulnerable individuals worldwide. currently, no licensed preventative vaccine is available for covid-19.to address the urgent need for a medical countermeasure to prevent the further dissemination of sars-cov-2 we have employed a synthetic dna-based vaccine approach. synthetic dna vaccines are amenable to accelerated developmental timelines due to the ability to quickly design multiple candidates for preclinical testing, scalable manufacturing of large quantities of the drug product, and the possibility to leverage established regulatory pathways to the clinic. synthetic dna is temperaturestable and cold-chain free, important features for delivery to resource-limited settings 7 . specifically for the development of a covid-19 vaccine candidate, we leveraged prior experiences in developing vaccine approaches to sars-cov 8 , and our own experience in developing a mers-cov vaccine (ino-4700) 9 ,10 , as well as taking advantage of our vaccine design and manufacturing pathway previously utilized for the zika vaccine candidate, gls-5700 11 , which was advanced to the clinic in under 7 months. ino-4700 and gls-5700 vaccines are currently in clinical testing.prior work has demonstrated that a dna approach for sars and mers can drive neutralizing antibody (nab) responses and provide protection in challenge models 8, 10 . our previous studies indicated immunization of small and large animal models with dna vaccines encoding mers-cov spike (s) protein provided protection against disease challenge with the matched virus. in subjects immunized with ino-4700 (mers-cov s protein dna vaccine) durable neutralizing antibodies (nabs) and t cell immune responses were measured, and a seroconversion rate of 96% was observed and immunity was followed for 60 weeks in most study volunteers 9 . ino-4700 phase 1/2a testing is continuing in south korea, and a larger phase 2 study is being planned to begin in the middle east, both areas which have been most affected by mers infections.the sars-cov-2 spike is most similar in sequence and structure to sars-cov spike protein 12 , and shares a global protein fold architecture with the mers-cov spike protein ( fig. 1 ) allowing us to build on our prior vaccine construct design 10 . unlike glycoproteins of hiv and influenza, the prefusion form of the coronavirus trimeric spike is conformationally dynamic, fully exposing the receptor-binding site infrequently 13 . the receptor-binding site is a vulnerable target for nabs. in fact, mers nabs targeted at the receptor-binding domain (rbd) tend to have greater neutralizing potency than other epitopes 14 . a recent report demonstrated that an anti-sars antibody could cross-react to the rbd of sars-cov-2 15 . these data suggest that the sars-cov-2 rbd is an important target for vaccine development. recent data has revealed sars-cov-2 s protein binds the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), as sars-cov s protein 12 .here, we describe the design and initial preclinical testing of covid-19 synthetic dna vaccine candidates. we show the expression of the sars-cov-2 s antigen rna and protein after in vitro transfection of cos-7 and 293t cells, respectively, with the vaccine candidates. we followed the induction of immunity by the selected immunogen in mice and guinea pigs, measuring sars-cov-2 s protein-specific antibody levels in serum and in the lung fluid, and antibody functionality through competitive inhibition of ace2 binding, pseudovirus and live virus neutralization. the ino-4800 vaccine induces cellular and humoral host immune responses that can be observed within days following a single immunization, including cross-reactive responses against sars-cov. the data demonstrate the immunogenicity of this covid-19 synthetic dna vaccine candidate targeting the sars-cov-2 s protein, supporting further translational studies to advance the development of this candidate in response to the current global health crisis.design and synthesis covid-19 dna vaccine constructs. four spike protein sequences were retrieved from the first four available sars-cov-2 full genome sequences published on gisaid (global initiative on sharing all influenza data). three spike sequences were 100% matched and one was considered an outlier (98.6% sequence identity with the other sequences). after performing a sequence alignment, the sars-cov-2 spike glycoprotein sequence was generated and an n-terminal ige leader sequence was added. the highly optimized dna sequence encoding sars-cov-2 ige-spike was created using inovio's proprietary in silico gene optimization algorithm to enhance expression and immunogenicity. the optimized dna sequence was synthesized, digested with bamhi and xhoi, and cloned into the expression vector pgx0001 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. the resulting plasmids were designated as pgx9501 and pgx9503, designed to encode the sars-cov-2 s protein from the three-matched sequences and the outlier sequence, respectively (fig. 2a) .in vitro characterization of covid-19 dna vaccine constructs. we measured the expression of the encoded sars-cov-2 spike transgene at the rna level in cos-7 cells transfected with pgx9501 and pgx9503. using the total rna extracted from the transfected cos-7 cells we confirmed expression of the spike transgene by rt-pcr (fig. 2b) . in vitro spike protein expression in hek-293t cells was measured by western blot analysis using a cross-reactive antibody against sars-cov s protein on cell lysates. western blots of the lysates of hek-293t cells transfected with pgx9501 or pgx9503 constructs revealed bands approximate to the predicted s protein molecular weight, 140-142 kda, with slight shifts likely due to the 22 potential n-linked glycans in the s protein (fig. 2c) . in immunofluorescent studies the s protein was detected in 293t cells transfected with pgx9501 or pgx9503 (fig. 2d) . in summary, in vitro studies revealed the expression of the spike protein at both the rna and protein level after transfection of cell lines with the candidate vaccine constructs.humoral immune responses in mice. since candidate design, it has been observed that newly published sars-cov-2 spike protein sequences match pgx9501 with >99.9% amino acid sequence identity (supplementary data 1). pgx9501 was therefore selected as the vaccine construct to advance to immunogenicity studies, due to the broader coverage it would likely provide compared with the outlier, pgx9503. pgx9501 was subsequently termed ino-4800. the immunogenicity of ino-4800 was evaluated in balb/c mice, postadministration to the tibialis anterior muscle using the cellec-tra® delivery device 16 . the reactivity of the sera from a group of mice immunized with ino-4800 was measured against a panel of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov antigens (fig. 3a) . analysis revealed igg binding against sars-cov-2 s protein antigens, with limited cross-reactivity to sars-cov s protein antigens, in the sera of ino-4800 immunized mice. we measured the serum igg binding endpoint titers (epts) in mice immunized with pdna against recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein s1 + s2 regions (fig. 3b, c) and recombinant sars-cov-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (rbd) (fig. 3d, e) . epts were observed in the sera of mice at day 14 after immunization with a single dose of ino-4800 (fig. 3c, e) .we developed a neutralization assay with a pnl4-3.luc.r-ebased pseudovirus displaying the sars-cov-2 spike protein. neutralization titers were detected by a reduction in relative luciferase units (rlu) compared with controls which had no decrease in rlu signal. balb/c mice were immunized twice with ino-4800, on days 0 and 14, and sera was collected on day 7 post-second immunization. the pseudovirus was incubated with serial dilutions of mouse sera and the sera-virus mixture was added to 293t cells stably expressing the human ace2 receptor (ace2-293t) for 72 h. neutralization id50 average titers of 92.2 were observed in ino-4800 immunized mice (fig. 4a, b) . no reduction in rlu was observed for the control animals. neutralizing titers were additionally measured against two wildtype sars-cov-2 virus strains by prnt assay. sera from ino-4800 immunized balb/c mice neutralized both sars-cov-2/wh-09/human/2020 and sars-cov-2/australia/vic01/2020 virus strains with average nd50 titers of 97.5 and 128.1, respectively (table 1) . live virus neutralizing titers were also evaluated in c57bl/6 mice following the same ino-4800 immunization regimen. sera from ino-4800 immunized c57bl/6 mice neutralized wildtype sars-cov-2 virus with average nd50 titer of 340 (table 1) .humoral immune responses in guinea pigs. we assessed the immunogenicity of ino-4800 in the hartley guinea pig model, an established model for intradermal vaccine delivery 17, 18 . one hundred micrograms of pdna was administered by mantoux injection to the skin and followed by cellectra® delivery device on day 0 as described in the methods section. on day 14 anti-spike protein binding of serum antibodies was measured by elisa. immunization with ino-4800 revealed an immune response in respect to sars-cov-2 s1 + 2 protein binding igg levels in the sera (fig. 5a, b) . the endpoint sars-cov-2 s protein binding titer at day 14 was 10,530 and 21 in guinea pigs treated with 100 µg ino-4800 or pvax (control), respectively (fig. 5b) . we next evaluated antibody neutralizing activity following intradermal ino-4800 immunization in the guinea pig model. guinea pigs were treated on days 0, 14, and 28 with pvax or ino-4800, and sera samples were collected on days 35 or 42 to measure sera neutralizing activity against pseudovirus or wildtype virus, respectively. sars-cov-2 pseudovirus neutralizing activity with average nd50 titers of 573.5 was observed for the ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs (table 1) . wildtype sars-cov-2 virus activity was also observed for the ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs with nd50 titers >320 by prnt assay observed in all animals ( table 1) .inhibition of sars-cov-2 s protein binding to ace2 receptor. the induction of antibodies capable of inhibiting spike protein engagement of host receptor is considered relevant for sars-cov-2 vaccine development. we therefore examined the receptor inhibiting functionality of ino-4800-induced antibody responses. we recently developed an elisa-based ace2 inhibition assay as a surrogate for neutralization. the assay is similar in principle to other surrogate neutralization assays which have been validated for coronaviruses 19 . as a control in our assay, we show ace2 can bind to sars-cov-2 spike protein with an ec 50 of 0.025 µg/ml (fig. 6a) . balb/c mice were immunized on days 0 and day 14 with 10 µg of ino-4800, and serum igg was purified on day 21 post-immunization to ensure inhibition is antibodymediated. we compared inhibition of the spike-ace2 interaction using serum igg from a naïve mouse and from an ino-4800 and pgx9503 (outlier (ol)) containing the ige leader sequence and sars-cov-2 spike protein insert. b rt-pcr assay of rna extracts from cos-7 cells transfected in duplicate with pgx9501 and pgx9503. extracted rna was analyzed by rt-pcr using pcr assays designed for each target and for cos-7 β-actin mrna, used as an internal expression normalization gene. delta c t (δ c t ) was calculated as the c t of the target minus the c t of β-actin for each transfection concentration and is plotted against the log of the mass of pdna transfected (plotted as mean ± sd). c analysis of in vitro expression of spike protein after transfection of 293t cells with pgx9501, pgx9503 or mock plasmid by western blot. 293t cell lysates were resolved on a gel and probed with a polyclonal anti-sars spike protein. blots were stripped then probed with an anti-β-actin loading control. d in vitro immunofluorescent staining of 293t cells transfected with 3 µg/well of pgx9501, pgx9503 or pvax (empty control vector). expression of spike protein was measured with polyclonal anti-sars spike protein igg and anti-igg secondary (green). cell nuclei were counterstained with dapi (blue). images were captured using imagexpress pico automated cell imaging system. scale bars are 80.15 µm (left), 66.8 µm (middle) and 77.31 µm (right). vaccinated mouse (fig. 6b) . we repeated the receptor inhibition assay with a group of five immunized mice, and demonstrating that ino-4800-induced antibodies competed with ace2 binding to the sars-cov-2 spike protein ( fig. 6c and supplementary  fig. 1 ). ace2 binding inhibition was further evaluated in the guinea pig model. sera collected from ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs inhibited binding of sars-cov-2 spike protein over range of concentrations of ace2 (0.25 µg/ml through 4 µg/ml) (fig. 6d) . furthermore, serum dilution curves revealed sera collected from ino-4800 immunized guinea pigs blocked binding of ace2 to sars-cov-2 in a dilution-dependent manner (fig. 6e ). sera collected from pvax-treated animals displayed negligible activity in the inhibition of ace2 binding to the virus protein, the decrease in od signal at the highest concentration of serum is considered a matrix effect in the assay. ace2 is considered to be the primary receptor for sars-cov-2 cellular entry and blocking this interaction suggests ino-4800-induced antibodies believed important to prevent host infection.in summary, humoral immunogenicity testing in both mice and guinea pigs revealed the covid-19 vaccine candidate, ino-4800, was capable of eliciting functional blocking antibody responses to sars-cov-2 spike protein.biodistribution of sars-cov-2 reactive igg to the lung. lower respiratory disease (lrd) is associated with severe cases of covid-19. the presence of antibodies at the lung mucosa targeting sars-cov-2 could potentially mediate protection against lrd. therefore, we evaluated the presence of sars-cov-2 specific antibody in the lungs of immunized mice and guinea pigs. balb/c mice and hartley guinea pigs were immunized, on days 0 and 14 or 0, 14 and 28, respectively, with ino-4800 or pvax control pdna. bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid was collected following sacrifice, and sars-cov-2 s protein elisas were performed. in both balb/c and hartley guinea pigs which received ino-4800 we measured a statistically significant increase in sars-cov-2 s protein binding igg in bal fluid compared with animals receiving pvax control (fig. 7a-d) . taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of anti-sars-cov-2 specific antibody in the lungs following immunization with ino-4800. fig. 3) .balb/c mouse sars-cov-2 epitope mapping. we performed epitope mapping on the splenocytes from balb/c mice receiving the 10 µg ino-4800 dose. thirty matrix mapping pools were used to stimulate splenocytes for 20 h and immunodominant responses were detected in multiple peptide pools (fig. 9a) . the responses were deconvoluted to identify several epitopes (h2-k d ) clustering in the receptor binding domain and in the s2 domain (fig. 9b) . interestingly, one sars-cov-2 h2-k d epitope, phgvvflhv, was observed to be overlapping and adjacent to the sars-cov human hla-a2 restricted epitope vvflhvtyv 20 .in summary, t cell responses against sars-cov-2 s protein epitopes were detected in mice immunized with ino-4800. the novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2, and associated covid-19 disease has become a global pandemic with a significant morbidity and mortality toll. currently, there are no covid-19 vaccines available, and global dissemination of sars-cov-2 may continue until there is a high level of herd immunity within the human population. here we have described the preclinical development of a synthetic dna-based covid-19 vaccine, ino-4800 to combat this emerging infectious disease. synthetic dna vaccine design and synthesis was immediately initiated upon public release of the sars-cov-2 genome sequences on 11 january 2020. our data support the expression and immunogenicity of the ino-4800 synthetic dna vaccine candidate in multiple animal models. humoral and t cell responses were observed in mice. in guinea pigs we employed clinical delivery parameters and observed sars-cov-2 s protein binding antibody titers and blocking of ace2/sars-cov-2 s protein interaction in serum samples from ino-4800-treated animals. nabs were also measured in both species.halting a rapidly emerging infectious disease requires an orchestrated response from the global health community and requires improved strategies to accelerate vaccine development. in response to the 2019/2020 coronavirus outbreak we employed a synthetic dna medicine platform. the design and manufacture of this synthetic dna vaccine represents a plug and play process in which we insert the target antigen sequence into a highly characterized and clinically tested plasmid vector backbone (pgx0001). the construct design and engineering parameters have been optimized for in vivo gene expression, and previously applied to mers, ebov, zika, and lassa dna vaccine constructs which are all undergoing clinical testing 7, 9, 11, 21, 22 .based upon our previous experience developing a vaccine against mers coronavirus, and previous published studies of sars vaccines, sars-cov-2 s protein was chosen as the antigen target. the sars-cov-2 s protein is a class i membrane fusion protein, which the major envelope protein on the surface of coronaviruses. initial studies have already been performed which indicate sars-cov-2 interaction with its host receptor (ace2) can be blocked by antibodies 23 . in vivo immunogenicity studies in both mouse and guinea pig models revealed levels of s proteinreactive igg in the serum of ino-4800 immunized animals. in addition to full-length s1 + s2 and s1, ino-4800 immunization induced rbd binding antibodies (fig. 3) , a domain known to be a target for nabs from sars-cov convalescent patients 24, 25 . we further demonstrate the functionality of these antibodies through neutralization of sars-cov-2 wild-type virus and pseudovirus (table 1) , and competitive inhibition of sars-cov-2 spike protein binding to the ace2 receptor in the presence of sera from ino-4800 immunized animals (fig. 6) . importantly, anti-sars-cov-2 binding antibodies were detected in lung washes of ino-4800-immunized mice and guinea pigs (fig. 7) . the presence of these antibodies in the lungs has the potential to protect against infection of these tissues and prevent lrd, which is associated with the severe cases of covid-19. in addition to humoral responses, cellular immune responses have been shown to be associated with more favorable recovery in mers-cov infection 26 , and are likely to be important against sars-cov infection 27 . here, we showed the induction of t cell responses against sars-cov-2 as early as day 7 post-vaccine delivery. rapid cellular responses have the potential to lower viral load and could potentially reduce the spread of sars-cov-2 and the associated covid-19 illness.we believe synthetic dna medicine platform has several synergistic characteristics which position it well to respond to disease outbreaks, such as covid-19. as mentioned previously, the ability to design and immediately synthesize candidate vaccine constructs means that in vitro and in vivo testing can potentially begin within days of receiving the viral sequence. the dna plasmid manufacture process allows for scalable manufacture of drug product, which has the potential to circumvent the complexities of conventional vaccine production in eggs or cell culture. additionally, we have published on the stability profile afforded to these products through the use of our optimized dna formulation 7 . the stability characteristics mean that our dna drug product is non-frozen and can be stored for 4.5+ years at 2-8°c, room temperature (rt) for 1 year and 1 month at 37°c, while maintaining potency at temperatures upwards of 60°c. in the context of a pandemic outbreak, the stability profile of a vaccine plays directly to its ability to be deployed and stockpiled in an efficient and executable manner. in this study, we observed seroconversion after a single intradermal administration of the ino-4800 in guinea pigs (fig. 6) . whether a single immunization will be sufficient in humans will be investigated in clinical trials.although vaccine-induced immunopathology has been raised as a potential concern for sars and mers vaccine candidates, and possibly for sars-cov-2 vaccines, these concerns are likely vaccine-platform dependent and, to-date, no evidence of immune pathogenesis has been reported for mers dna vaccines in mice or non-human primate models 10 or sars dna vaccines in mice 8 . lung immunopathology characterized by th2-related eosinophilia has been reported for whole inactivated virus (iv), recombinant protein, peptide, and/or recombinant viral vector vaccines following sars-cov challenge [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , and more recently in a mers-cov challenge model 33 . however, in the majority of studies protective efficacy without lung immunopathology has been reported for sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines 8, 10, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . it is important to note the majority of studies demonstrating cov vaccine-induced immunopathology utilized the balb/c mouse, a model known to preferentially develop th2-type responses. the dna vaccine platform induces th1-type immune responses and has demonstrated efficacy without immunopathology in models of respiratory infection, including sars-cov 8 , mers-cov 10 , and rsv 41 . sars-cov-2 animal challenge studies will assess ino-4800-mediated protection against disease, and vaccineenhanced disease.here, we report functional neutralization of ino-4800 immune sera using a sars-cov-2 pseudovirus assay (fig. 4 , table 1 ), and prnt assay against two wild-type sars-cov-2 strains ( table 1) . as well, we show that ino-4800 induced antibodies block sars-cov-2 spike binding to the host receptor ace2, using a surrogate neutralization assay (fig. 6 ). this study highlights the immunogenicity of ino-4800, and further animal studies will test protection against infection.in summary, these initial results describing the immunogenicity of covid-19 vaccine candidate, ino-4800 are promising, and it is particularly encouraging to measure functional antibodies and t cell responses in multiple animal models. this study supports the further evaluation of ino-4800 as a vaccine candidate for covid-19.cell lines. hek-293t (atcc® crl-3216™) and african green monkey kidney cos-7 (atcc® crl-1651™) cell lines were obtained from atcc (old town manassas, va). all cell lines were maintained in dmem supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs) and penicillin-streptomycin.in vitro rna expression (qrt-pcr) in vitro mrna expression of the plasmid was demonstrated by transfection of cos-7 with serially diluted plasmids followed by analysis of the total rna extracted from the cells using reverse transcription and pcr. transfections of four concentrations of the plasmid were performed using fugene® 6 transfection reagent (promega) which resulted in final masses ranging between 80 and 10 ng per well. the transfections were performed in duplicate. following 18 to 26 h of incubation the cells were lysed with rlt buffer (qiagen). total rna was isolated from each well using the qiagen rneasy kit following the kit instructions. the resulting rna concentration was determined by od 260/280 and samples of the rna were diluted to 10 ng per µl. one hundred nanograms of rna was then converted to cdna using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription (revt) kit (applied biosystems) following the kit instructions. revt reactions containing rna but no reverse transcriptase (minus rt) were included as controls for plasmid dna or cellular genomic dna sample contamination. eight microliters of sample cdna were then subjected to pcr using primers and probes that are specific to the target sequence (pgx9501 forward -caggac aagaacacacaggaa; pgx9501 reverse -caggcaggatttgggagaaa; pgx9501 probe -acccatcaaggactttggagg; and pgx9503 forward -aggacaagaacacacaggaag; pgx9503 reverse -caggatctggga gaagttgaag; pgx9503 probe -acaccacccatcaaggactttgga). in a separate reaction, the same quantity of sample cdna was subjected to pcr using primers and a probe designed (β-actin forward -gtgacgtggacatccgta aa; β-actin reverse -cagggcagtaatctccttctg; β-actin probe -tac cctggcattgctgacaggatg) for cos-7 cell line β-actin sequences. the primers and probes were synthesized by integrated dna technologies, inc. and the probes were labeled with 56-fam and black hole quencher 1. the reaction used abi fast advance 2×(cat. no. 4444557), with final forward and reverse primer concentrations of 1 µm and probe concentrations of 0.3 µm. using a quantstudio 7 flex real time pcr studio system (applied biosystems), samples were first subjected to a hold of 1 min at 95°c and then 40 cycles of pcr with each cycle consisting of 1 s at 95°c and 20 s at 60°c. following pcr, the amplifications results were analyzed as follows. the negative transfection controls, the minus revt controls, and the ntc were scrutinized for each of their respective indications. the threshold cycle (c t ) of each transfection concentration for the ino-4800 covid-19 target mrna and for the β-actin mrna was generated from the quantstudio software using an automatic threshold setting. the plasmid was considered to be active for mrna expression if the expression in any of the plasmid transfected wells compared with the negative transfection controls were greater than 5 c t .in vitro protein expression (western blot). human embryonic kidney cells, 293t were cultured and transfected as described previously 42 . 293t cells were transfected with pdna using turbofectin8.0 (origene) transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. forty-eight hours later cell lysates were harvested using modified ripa cell lysis buffer. proteins were separated on a 4-12% bis-tris gel (thermofisher scientific), then following transfer, blots were incubated with an anti-sars-cov spike protein polyclonal antibody (novus biologicals) then visualized with horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated anti-mouse igg (ge amersham).immunofluorescence of transfected 293t cells. for in vitro staining of spike protein expression 293t cells were cultured on 4-well glass slides (lab-tek) and transfected with 3 µg per well of pdna using turbofectin8.0 (origene) transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. cells were fixed 48 h after transfection with 10% neutral-buffered formalin (bbc biochemical, washington state) for 10 min at rt and then washed with pbs. before staining, chamber slides were blocked with 0.3% (v/v) triton-x (sigma), 2% (v/v) donkey serum in pbs for 1 h at rt. cells were stained with a rabbit anti-sars-cov spike protein polyclonal antibody (novus biologicals) diluted in 1% (w/v) bsa (sigma), 2% (v/v) donkey serum, 0.3% (v/v) triton-x (sigma) and 0.025% (v/v) 1 g ml −1 sodium azide (sigma) in pbs for 2 h at rt. slides were washed three times for 5 min in pbs and then stained with donkey anti-rabbit igg af488 (lifetechnologies, a21206) for 1 h at rt. slides were washed again and mounted and covered with dapi-fluoromount (southernbiotech). antigen binding elisa. elisas were performed to determine sera antibody binding titers. nunc elisa plates were coated with 1 µg ml −1 recombinant protein antigens in dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (dpbs) overnight at 4°c. plates were washed three times then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (bsa) in dpbs with 0.05% tween 20 for 2 h at 37°c. plates were then washed and incubated with serial dilutions of mouse or guinea pig sera and incubated for 2 h at 37°c. plates were again washed and then incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of horse radish peroxidase (hrp) conjugated anti-guinea pig igg secondary antibody (sigma-aldrich, cat. a7289) or (hrp) conjugated anti-mouse igg secondary antibody (sigma-aldrich) and incubated for 1 h at rt. after final wash plates were developed using sureblue tm tmb 1-component peroxidase substrate (kpl, cat. 52-00-03) and the reaction stopped with tmb stop solution (kpl, cat. 50-85-06). plates were read at 450 nm wavelength within 30 min using a synergy htx (biotek instruments, highland park, vt). binding antibody epts were calculated as previously described 43 . binding antigens tested included, sars-cov-2 antigens: s1 spike protein (sino biological 40591-v08h), s1 + s2 ecd spike protein (sino biological 40589-v08b1), rbd (university of texas, at austin (mclellan lab.)); sars-cov antigens: spike s1 protein (sino biological 40150-v08b1), s (1-1190) (immune tech it-002-001p) and spike c-terminal (meridian life science r18572).ace2 competition elisa. for mouse studies, elisas were performed to determine sera igg antibody competition against human ace2 with a human fc tag. nunc elisa plates were coated with 1 µg ml −1 rabbit anti-his6x in 1× pbs for 4-6 h at rt and washed four times with washing buffer (1× pbs and 0.05% tween 20) . plates were blocked overnight at 4°c with blocking buffer (1× pbs, 0.05% tween 20, 5% evaporated milk and 1% fbs). plates were washed four times with washing buffer then incubated with full length (s1 + s2) spike protein containing a c-terminal his tag (sino biologics, cat. 40589-v08b1) at 10 µg ml −1 for 1 h at rt. plates were washed and then serial dilutions of purified mouse igg mixed with 0.1 µg ml −1 recombinant human ace2 with a human fc tag (ace2-ighu) were incubated for 1-2 h at rt. plates were again washed and then incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of hrp conjugated anti-human igg secondary antibody (bethyl, cat. a80-304p) and incubated for 1 h at rt. after final wash plates were developed using 1-step ultra tmb-elisa substrate (thermo, cat. 34029) and the reaction stopped with 1 m sulfuric acid. plates were read at 450 nm wavelength within 30 min using a spectramax plus 384 microplate reader (molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca). competition curves were plotted and the area under the curve (auc) was calculated using prism 8 analysis software with multiple t-tests to determine statistical significance.for guinea pig studies, 96-well half area assay plates (costar) were coated with 25 µl per well of 5 µg ml −1 of sars-cov-2 spike s1 + s2 protein (sino biological) diluted in 1× dpbs (thermofisher) overnight at 4°c. plates were washed with 1× pbs buffer with 0.05% tween (sigma). hundred microliters per well of 3% (w/v) bsa (sigma) in 1× pbs with 0.05% tween were added and incubated for 1 h at 37°c. serum samples were diluted 1:20 in 1% (w/v) bsa in 1× pbs with 0.05% tween. after washing the assay plate, 25 µl/well of diluted serum was added and incubated 1 h at 37°c. human recombinant ace2-fc-tag (sinobiological) was added directly to the diluted serum, followed by 1 h of incubation at 37°c. plates were washed and 25 µl per well of 1:10,000 diluted goat anti-hu fc fragment antibody hrp (bethyl, a80-304p) was added to the assay plate. plates were incubated 1 h at rt. for development the sureblue/tmb stop solution (kpl, md) was used and o.d. was recorded at 450 nm.sars-cov-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. sars-cov-2 pseudotyped viruses were produced using hek293t cells transfected with genejammer (agilent) using ige-sars-cov-2 s plasmid (genscript) and pnl4-3.luc.r-e-plasmid (nih aids reagent) at a 1:1 ratio. forty-eight hours post transfection, transfection supernatant was collected, enriched with fbs to 12% final volume, steri-filtered (millipore sigma), and aliquoted for storage at −80°c. sars-cov-2 pseudotyped viruses were titered and yielding >50 times the relative luminescence units (rlu) to cells alone after 72 h of infection. mouse sera from ino-4800 vaccinated and naive groups were heat inactivated for 15 min at 56°c and serially diluted threefold starting at a 1:10 dilution for assay. sera were incubated with a fixed amount of sars-cov-2 pseudotyped virus for 90 min. hek293t cells stably expressing ace2 were added after 90 min and allowed to incubate in standard incubator (37% humidity, 5% co 2 ) for 72 h. post infection, cells were lysed using britelite plus luminescence reporter gene assay system (perkin elmer catalog no. 6066769) and rlu were measured using the biotek plate reader. neutralization titers (id 50 ) were calculated as the serum dilution at which rlu were reduced by 50% compared with rlu in virus control wells after subtraction of background rlu in cell control wells.sars-cov-2 wildtype virus neutralization assays. sars-cov-2/australia/ vic01/2020 isolate neutralization assays were performed at public health england (porton down, uk). neutralizing virus titers were measured in serum samples that had been heat-inactivated at 56°c for 30 min. sars-cov-2 (australia/vic01/2020 isolate 44 ) was diluted to a concentration of 933 pfu ml −1 and mixed 50:50 in 1% fcs/mem containing 25 mm hepes buffer with doubling serum dilutions from 1:10 to 1:320 in a 96-well v-bottomed plate. the plate was incubated at 37°c in a humidified box for 1 h before the virus was transferred into the wells of a twice dpbs-washed 24-well plate that had been seeded the previous day at 1.5 × 10 5 vero e6 cells per well in 10% fcs/mem. virus was allowed to adsorb at 37°c for a further hour, and overlaid with plaque assay overlay media (1× mem/1.5% cmc/ 4% fcs final). after 5 days incubation at 37°c in a humidified box, the plates were fixed, stained and plaques counted. median neutralizing titers (nd50) were determined using the spearman-karber formula relative to virus only control wells.sars-cov-2/wh-09/human/2020 isolate neutralization assays were performed at the institute of laboratory animal science, chinese academy of medical sciences (cams) approved by the national health commission of the people's republic of china. seed sars-cov-2 (sars-cov-2/wh-09/human/ 2020) stocks and virus isolation studies were performed in vero e6 cells, which are maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem, invitrogen, carlsbad, usa) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs), 100 iu ml −1 penicillin, and 100 µg ml −1 streptomycin, and incubated at 36.5°c, 5% co 2 . virus titer were determined using a standard 50% tissue culture infection dose (tcid50) assay. serum samples collected from immunized animals were inactivated at 56°c for 30 min and serially diluted with cell culture medium in two-fold steps. the diluted samples were mixed with a virus suspension of 100 tcid 50 in 96-well plates at a ratio of 1:1, followed by 2 h incubation at 36.5°c in a 5% co 2 incubator. 1-2 × 10 4 vero cells were then added to the serum-virus mixture, and the plates were incubated for 3-5 days at 36.5°c in a 5% co 2 incubator. cytopathic effect (cpe) of each well was recorded under microscopes, and the neutralizing titer was calculated by the dilution number of 50% protective condition.bal collection. bal fluid was collected by washing the lungs of euthanized and exsanguinated mice with 700-1000 μl of ice-cold pbs containing 100 μm edta, 0.05% sodium azide, 0.05% tween-20, and 1× protease inhibitor (pierce) (mucosal prep solutions (mps) with a blunt-ended needle. guinea pig lungs were washed with 20 ml of mps via 16 g catheter inserted into the trachea. collected bal fluid was stored at −20c until the time of assay.ifn-γ elispot. spleens from mice were collected individually in rpmi1640 media supplemented with 10% fbs (r10) and penicillin/streptomycin and processed into single cell suspensions. cell pellets were re-suspended in 5 ml of ack lysis buffer (life technologies, carlsbad, ca) for 5 min rt, and pbs was then added to stop the reaction. the samples were again centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min, cell pellets re-suspended in r10, and then passed through a 45 µm nylon filter before use in elispot assay. elispot assays were performed using the mouse ifn-γ elispot plus plates (mabtech). 96-well elispot plates precoated with capture antibody were blocked with r10 medium overnight at 4°c. 200,000 mouse splenocytes were plated into each well and stimulated for 20 h with pools of 15-mer peptides overlapping by nine amino acid from the sars-cov-2, sars-cov, or mers-cov spike proteins (five peptide pools per protein). additionally, matrix mapping was performed using peptide pools in a matrix designed to identify immunodominant responses. cells were stimulated with a final concentration of 5 μl of each peptide per well in rpmi + 10% fbs (r10). the spots were developed based on manufacturer's instructions. r10 and cell stimulation cocktails (invitrogen) were used for negative and positive controls, respectively. spots were scanned and quantified by immunospot ctl reader. spot-forming unit (sfu) per million cells was calculated by subtracting the negative control wells.flow cytometry. intracellular cytokine staining was performed on splenocytes harvested from balb/c and c57bl/6 mice stimulated with the overlapping peptides spanning the sars-cov-2 s protein for 6 h at 37°c, 5% co 2 . cells were stained with the following antibodies from bd biosciences, unless stated, with the dilutions stated in parentheses: fitc anti-mouse cd107a (1:100), percp-cy5.5 anti-mouse cd4 (1:100), apc anti-mouse cd8a (1:100), vivid dye (1-40) (live/dead® fixable violet dead cell stain kit; invitrogen, l34955), apc-cy7 anti-mouse cd3e (1:100), and bv605 anti-mouse ifn-γ (1:75) (ebiosciences). phorbol myristate acetate (pma) were used as a positive control, and complete medium only as the negative control. cells were washed, fixed and, cell events were acquired using an facs canto (bd biosciences), followed by flowjo software (flowjo llc, ashland, or) analysis.structural modeling. the structural models for sars-cov and mers-cov were constructed from pdb ids 6acc and 5×59 in order to assemble a prefusion model with all three rbds in the down conformation. the sars-cov-2 structural model was built by using sars-cov structure (pdb id:6acc) as a template. rosetta remodel simulations were employed to make the appropriate amino acid mutations and to build de novo models for sars-cov-2 loops not structurally defined in the sars-cov structure 45 . amino acid positions neighboring the loops were allowed to change backbone conformation to accommodate the new loops. the structural figures were made using pymol.statistics. all statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 7 or 8 software (la jolla, ca). these data were considered significant if p < 0.05. the lines in all graphs represent the mean value and error bars represent the standard deviation. no samples or animals were excluded from the analysis. randomization was not performed for the animal studies. samples and animals were not blinded before performing each experiment.reporting summary. further information on research design is available in the nature research reporting summary linked to this article.the global health system consists of a network of organizations, including many private and public health sectors operating at different regional or global levels that have developed a stringent system that can provide effective protection to humans against emerging and re-emerging diseases. though mortality associated with various infectious diseases have reduced in recent years and global life expectancy has increased in many parts of the world, infectious disease threats still remain one of the major global challenges and concerns even now [1]. the global health system is often confronted by emerging pathogens responsible for expanding an array of infectious diseases such as zika, chikungunya, ebola, nipah, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), and influenza. the emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has recently added to the list of problematic emerging pathogens in the 21st century, which was suspected to originate from the persons exposed to a seafood or wet market in wuhan, hubei province, china, suggesting animal-to-human transmission [2,3]. this virus strain is previously unknown and was reported to infect humans for the first time. the virus continues to expand rapidly throughout the world. many confirmed and susceptible cases have been identified in wuhan, china, and exported cases have also been reported in neighboring countries including thailand, japan, korea, taiwan, and other countries including the united states, canada, and european countries, which proves that the virus has the potential for quick dissemination across borders. in response to the rapid spread of the virus, many countries have tightened their border security, investigating people showing symptoms, and have taken necessary emergency steps to control its spread. due to the increasing number of cases in china and other countries, the who has declared the 2019-ncov outbreak a global health emergency of international concern on 30 january 2020 [4].coronaviruses (covs) belongs to the family coronaviridae, subfamily coronavirinae, and the order nidovirales. they are classified into four genera such as alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, both of which infect mammals, whereas gammacoronavirus infect avian species, and deltacoronavirus infect both mammalian and avian species. it is a large enveloped virus with a positive sense, single-stranded rna genome of about 26 to 33 kb that is distributed broadly among birds, humans, and other mammals such as camels, bats, mice, dogs, and cats [5]. the genome is surrounded by a helical capsid and an envelope; the spike protein forms large protrusions in the envelope in the shape of a crown, which gives the virus a coronal appearance. the word ‘corona’ in latin means crown [6,7].human coronaviruses (hcovs) are a major group of coronaviruses that are known respiratory pathogens associated with respiratory and intestinal infections of varying severity, including the common cold, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis. human coronaviruses such as hcov-229e, oc43, nl63, and hku1, usually cause mild infection in humans. however, the onset of betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) outbreak in guangdong province, china in 2003, and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) disease outbreak in 2012 in the middle east resulted in high pathogenicity in humans, which demonstrated the lethality of virus when they cross the species barrier from animals to humans. both viruses are believed to be originated from bats and subsequently transmitted to humans [8]. hcovs has evolved rapidly in recent years due to mutation, high nucleotide substitution rates, its ability to establish infection in a new host, and cross-species transmission [9].in december 2019, china detected many cases of viral pneumonia-like disease similar to sars that were confirmed to be caused by novel betacoronavirus, provisionally called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). since then, the novel coronavirus outbreak has raised attention throughout the world. although the potential cause of the disease is still unknown, initial reports predicted that the virus is possibly of zoonotic origin. 2019-ncov is the causative agent for severe respiratory infection in humans termed as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (ncip) [10]. ncov is the third known coronavirus that causes fatal respiratory diseases in humans after highly pathogenic viruses sars-cov and mers-cov. chinese researchers isolated the novel coronavirus from the infected patient in early 2020. as the virus is closely related to other bat coronaviruses, it is suspected that the bats are the primary reservoir for the virus. however, it is still unclear that, if the virus transmitted to humans directly from the bats or whether through an intermediate host. detailed understanding of the enzootic patterns of the virus, its evolution, and surveillance are essential to control the disease and possibly to prevent the future epidemics of similar viruses.the explosive outbreak of 2019-ncov in china has been spread rapidly in many countries, probably by human movement and travel. the geographical distribution of the virus has been increasing since the outbreak. in early february 2020, thousands of cases were confirmed in china and more than 300 cases were reported outside of china, and numbers of cases are escalating daily in all the provinces in china and other countries. the virus has transmitted rapidly and many cases were reported globally. as of february 8, 2020, nearly 34,598 affected cases and 723 fatalities were reported in china. most of the confirmed cases were from the wuhan city in hubei province. outside china, 288 other cases were confirmed globally, and one death was reported in philippines. in singapore, 33 cases were confirmed, 32 in thailand, 25 in japan, 24 in korea, 15 each in australia and malaysia, 12 in united states, and some cases were reported in germany, france, vietnam, uae, canada, india, philippines, italy, uk, russia, nepal, sri lanka, cambodia, belgium, finland, sweden, and spain as on early february [11]. chinese health authorities, who, and most of the countries have responded fast, and immediate actions were taken to contain the virus. all the countries have implemented stringent border control, screening travelers for possible infection, and travel restrictions in order to prevent its spread. the rapid spread of this infection is frightening and also it causes both mortality and financial loss, which present the global concern of this emerging disease.the transmission of 2019-ncov is often spread from person to person through the respiratory droplets generated during coughs or sneezes from an infected person. human-to-human transmission is reported in countries such as germany, japan, vietnam, and the united states [12]. the confirmed cases through inter-human transmission have increased the fear and panic accompanying the 2019-ncov outbreak. it is still unknown whether the virus spreads only through human contact or if there is possible transmission through oral-fecal contact as well.the incubation time varies from 2–14 days after infection. the clinical presentation of this infection resembles sars-cov characterized with fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath in most of the cases, whereas non-respiratory symptoms such as headache, muscle ache, dyspnoea, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are also reported in few patients. the affected persons also develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. cases with critical illness showed respiratory failure, septic shock, and organs failure, which require intensive care support [3,13,14].at this time, the knowledge about this virus is limited. new cases and mortalities are increasing daily. as a newly emerging viral infection, there is no vaccine or anti-viral therapeutics to treat human coronavirus infection till now. as of now, preventing infection is the current priority for disease control. the current protocol for infected patients is to quarantine and provide supportive management and palliative care. the best way to avoid the virus infection is to keep oneself away from infected people and the utmost personal hygienic care is essential. quarantine measures shall be taken to separate, restrict the movement of infected people, and also the normal population from the regions where there is an epidemic outbreak. the who recommended precautionary measures to the general public, such as frequently cleaning hands, wearing a face mask, avoiding close contact with the infected persons or farm animals, and avoiding consumption of raw or half-cooked meat/eggs and following good food safety practices [11].there is an urgent need to develop rapid diagnostic tools and vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to treat this infection. reliable, timely laboratory diagnosis and an effective vaccine are crucial for effective disease management and public health intervention. an effective vaccine should be affordable, and also the production platform should produce suitable vaccine candidates rapidly at low cost, especially during a disease outbreak. the advantages and disadvantages of the current expression systems for recombinant protein production are given in table 1. currently, plant expression system offers many advantages over other conventional systems that have the potential to tackle the production of vaccine candidates rapidly at affordable cost facilitating the global vaccination programs, especially in resource-poor nations where the vaccines are needed most [15].in recent years, plants are being focused more on the production of biopharmaceuticals and virus-like particles (vlp’s). the technologies employed for the production of plant-made vaccines are stable nuclear expression, transient expression, and chloroplast expression. based on several vital factors like yield, quality, time, and cost, appropriate technology can be chosen for producing biopharmaceuticals. recent advancements in the plant expression strategies, especially the development of transient expression system or viral vectors, resulted in a huge increase in the protein yield that makes this plant host system, a promising system for the production of various biopharmaceutical proteins [16]. several reports in the last two decades have enough evidence to prove that the plant produced biopharmaceuticals are as effective as the mammalian cell-based proteins and also elicit potent neutralizing antibodies, or shown therapeutic effects against the particular pathogen or infection [17,18,19].the use of plants for the production of recombinant proteins and biopharmaceuticals has been gaining importance since the plant produced biologic taliglucerase alfa has been commercialized in 2012 against gaucher’s disease that proclaimed a new era for plant made biopharmaceutical and triggered the innovation in the field of biopharmaceuticals [20]. furthermore, many plant-produced candidates are in the clinical pipeline close to commercialization. some of the examples of plant-produced recombinant antigens and monoclonal antibodies for infectious diseases are given in table 2. currently, countries, including thailand, india, japan, korea, and the european community, are majorly involved in developing plant biopharmaceuticals against several human diseases [21]. many reports reviewed the importance of plant expression system for the rapid production of candidate vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against infectious diseases [22,23,24,25,26,27].many biopharmaceutical companies have shifted their momentum towards the plant expression system by knowing its importance. various plants such as tobacco, duckweed, moss, alfalfa, and other plants have been used for the production of plant-made pharmaceuticals. in september 2015, leaf bio, inc., the commercial partner of mapp biopharmaceutical, inc. (mapp), received fast track designation by the u.s fda for their plant-made biopharmaceutical called zmapp for the treatment of ebola virus disease. the authorization of plant-based biopharmaceutical zmapp for emergency use in the earlier ebv outbreak by fda is potentially a major breakthrough in the plant molecular farming field, as it serves as an endorsement of the technology to potential investors and grant funding agencies [50,55,56]. many vaccine antigens expressed in plants are in clinical or advanced pre-clinical trials. major players in the global plant-based biologics market include plantform, ibio inc., mapp biopharmaceutical, inc., pfizer inc., ventria bioscience, medicago inc., greenovation biotech gmbh, kentucky bioprocessing, phycobiologics inc., synthon, fraunhofer ime, healthgen, planet biotechnology, and icon genetics gmbh.as plant-made biopharmaceuticals provide efficacious and cost-effective strategies to protect against emerging infectious diseases, plant expression systems can be employed for the development of vaccines against ncov. transient expression in plants can be adapted for biopharmaceutical protein production when it is necessary to produce ‘rapid response vaccines’ as it produces more protein in a short time. the plant-based biopharmaceutical production against 2019-ncov will include the identification of potential epitopes and production of full-length viral surface proteins present in the envelope region or production of subunit vaccines expressing immunogenic region or chimeric proteins.the receptor-binding domain (rbd) in spike protein located on the outer membrane of coronavirus mediates receptor binding and plays a major role in virus entry into the host cell [57]. this protein could be used as a potential vaccine candidate as it is the major target for neutralizing antibodies [58]. hence, it could be considered to develop potential effective vaccines or therapeutics against coronavirus infection. as the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), the host cell receptor for its cell entry similar like sars-cov [59,60,61], the monoclonal antibodies that are identified and tested to be effective against sars virus protein or specific to ace2 can be produced in plants and shall be tested for its efficacy against ncov. earlier reports showed several vaccines and monoclonal antibody candidates in response to sars-cov and mers-cov, which could be tested and used for passive immunotherapy for an immediate immune response [62,63,64]. the possibility of producing a vlp based vaccine is also feasible by expressing all the structural viral proteins that can assemble into vlps in plants. the structural and functional studies of viral proteins in ncov might help in designing better vaccines and specific therapeutics. producing viral proteins in plants may further be helpful to evaluate their potential in developing diagnostic kits or the protection/therapeutic tools that can be manufactured fast in order to manage the highly infectious ncov. this will open an avenue to characterize recombinant immunogenic viral proteins and provide a proof of concept for using plants as a robust, rapid, and flexible platform for producing protein/research reagents, which are highly essential to face potential ncov outbreaks.the coronavirus outbreak has been declared a global health emergency and represents one of the greatest risks to global health, as the virus has a tendency to infect a large number of human populations, and the outbreak can cause severe medical complications with economic impact, particularly in middle-income countries where resources are limited for early diagnosis and preventive measures. human mobility, air travel, and international trade can likely increase the number of cases in other regions as well. continued surveillance along with the robust response of government agencies, medical practitioners, and researchers, is highly essential for the effective management of this emerging pathogen. public health officials need to identify the source and virus reservoir, transmission cycle, pathogenesis, inter-human transmission, and clinical manifestations, which might be helpful to develop animal models, diagnostic reagents, anti-viral therapies, and vaccines against this pathogen. as the virus emerged suddenly and became a serious global concern, there is a need for rapid vaccine development. although classical expression systems for biopharmaceutical proteins are still amenable, the development of transient expression in plants has deeply influenced the pharmaceutical sector to produce affordable vaccines and biologics rapidly at low cost. hence, the plant expression platform shall be employed for biopharmaceutical production to accelerate the fight against this deadly infectious disease. the collaborative efforts of researchers are highly desirable to use a plant expression platform for producing an efficient cost-effective vaccine to control this epidemic. the continuous effort of research in this direction might be helpful in producing high-value biologics and pharmaceuticals on a large scale in a short time, especially during epidemics.a novel β-coronavirus (β-cov) named middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronavirus (mers-cov) was first identified in humans in the middle east in june 2012. the virus was isolated from a 60-year-old saudi man who was diagnosed as progressive community-acquired pneumonia and subsequent acute renal failure with a fatal outcome [1] . increasing numbers of cases have resulted from mers-cov infection as shown in figure 1 [2] . as of march 26, 2014, a total of 200 human mers-cov infections with 85 deaths had been reported in the middle east, north africa and several european countries by who [2] . while many animals are considered reservoirs for covs, the origin of mers-cov and mode of disease transmission still remain unknown. based on a sequence fragment identical to mers-cov found in a taphozous perforates bat captured in saudi arabia, it has been inferred that bats are the most likely reservoir for mers-cov [3] . the identification of mers-cov in dromedary camels and the detection of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of these animals suggest that camels could be the intermediate host of mers-cov [4, 5] . it is thus suspected that mers-cov emerged as interspecies transmission from bats to other animals, such as camels, and then to humans [6] .several family clusters with mers-cov infection have been reported [7, 8] , suggesting human-to-human transmission of the disease. most people who were infected with mers-cov developed severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath. the virus has an estimated incubation period of 12 days [9] . the transmissibility of mers-cov between humans is currently less efficient than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), which emerged in guangdong province in china in 2002 and reemerged in 2004, with over 8,000 cases and more than 700 deaths in 29 countries throughout the world [10] . nonetheless, the mortality rate for mers (~43%) is much higher than that for sars (~10%) [11] . it has been reported that mers-cov, but not sars-cov, could replicate in cell lines from four major chiropteran families, implying the ability of mers-cov in crossing species barrier between humans and bats [12] . with increased human cases and high mortality rate, mers-cov infection has raised serious global concerns, although it is still too early to implicate any impending pandemic. vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent virus infection. thus, development of effective vaccines is essential to fight against this infectious disease.as proposed by the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses (ictv), three groups, 1, 2 and 3, of the coronaviridae family have been commonly accepted as α-cov, β-cov and γ-cov, respectively, where the genus β-cov consists of four lineages, namely a, b, c and d [13] . a novel genus, δ-cov, including hku11, hku12, and hku13 identified in birds in 2005, was added in the cov genera [13] .unlike any other previously identified covs, such as alpha-cov nl63, which was first reported in 2004 [14] , as well as β-cov hku1, which was first discovered in hong kong in 2005 [15, 16] , and sars-cov, which caused a worldwide outbreak in 2003 [17] , mers-cov belongs to lineage c of β-cov, and is the first known lineage c β-cov associated with human infections [18] . phylogenetically, mers-cov is closely related to bat covs hku4 and hku5 [19] [20] [21] .mers-cov is a positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus. its genome is about 30 kilobase pairs (kb) in length, consisting of 11 functional open reading frames (orfs) (figure 2 & table 1 ). the viral genome encodes five unique proteins, known as accessory proteins (3, 4a, 4b, 5, 8b) , which serve different functions with no known homologues to any other cov proteins. accessory protein 4a, for example, was recently proven to block the production of host interferon (ifn) [22] . although these accessory proteins are not essential for virus replication, recent studies by reverse genetics demonstrated that the absence of the genes encoding these proteins as a group may attenuate viral titers [23] . additionally, the genome of mers-cov encodes six proteins, which are homologous to those of the known covs, including two replicase proteins, orfs 1a and 1b and four major structural proteins, such as spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) proteins ( figure 2 ) [11] . the e protein is a transmembrane protein forming an ion channel on the viral surface. the cov n protein plays an important role in encapsidating the genomic rna and interacting with the m protein and other n molecules [24] .the s protein of covs is a type i transmembrane glycoprotein displayed as an oligomer on the surface of the viral membrane. the precursor s protein contains a cleavage site at which the protein could be cleaved into two non-covalently associated subunits: the distal subunit s1 and the membrane-anchored subunit s2 [25] . the s1 subunit contains the cellular receptor-binding domain (rbd) [26] , while the s2 subunit contains a putative fusion peptide, transmembrane domain and two heptad repeat regions: the heptad repeat 1 and 2 (hr1 and hr2) ( figure 3 ) [27] . figure 3a lists the representative structures of s proteins of αand β-cov nl63-cov, mouse hepatitis cov (mhv-cov) and sars-cov [28] [29] [30] , with the rbds of these cov s proteins consisting of respective core and receptor-binding subdomains. for example, the receptor-binding motif of sars-cov contains residues from 424 to 494, which form a long extended loop with two short antiparallel β-sheets and one disulfide bond between c467 and c474 [31] .similar to the s proteins of other covs, the s protein of mers-cov also contains s1 and s2 subunits, with s1 being responsible for receptor binding and s2 for membrane fusion [32] . unlike covs sars-cov and nl63-cov, which use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as their receptors [33, 34] , mers-cov utilizes human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4, also known as cd26) as its cellular receptor. dpp4 is expressed on primary bronchiolar epithelial cells and regulates the activity of hormones and chemokines through proteolytic cleavage [12, 35] . recent studies have solved the crystal structures of mers-cov s protein alone, or complexed with its receptor dpp4, and mapped the rbd of mers-cov to the residues covering 367-588 or 367-606, respectively [32, 36, 37] . according to the crystal structures, the rbd of mers-cov also contains the core and receptor-binding subdomains, with the receptor-binding motif consisting of 84 amino acids (from v484 to l567) that form a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet ( figure 3b ) [32, 36] . similar to other covs, the hr1 and hr2 of mers-cov form a 6-helix bundle believed to drive virion-cell membrane fusion, with three hr1 helices forming the central coiled-coil core and three hr2 chains surrounding the core in the hr1 side grooves [23, 38, 39] . figure 4 describes the crystal structures of sars-cov and mers-cov rbd complexed with their respective receptors, and the major neutralizing epitopes on sars-cov rbd for the neutralizing monoclonal antibody against sars-cov [36, [40] [41] [42] . understanding of these neutralizing epitopes in rbd of sars-cov will provide useful guidance for the identification of the neutralizing epitopes in mers-cov rbd and, hence designing rbd-based, neutralizing epitope-dependent vaccines against mers-cov.previous reviews on sars have summarized the approaches for the development of effective cov vaccines, pointed out the importance of sars-cov s protein as a target for vaccine and therapeutic development and outlined a roadmap for the product development of a sars-cov rbd protein-based subunit vaccine with manufacturing for future clinical testing [43] [44] [45] [46] . in this review, we will briefly discuss current stages of mers vaccine development, and provide potential strategies for developing mers vaccines based on the experience from development of sars vaccines, with the focus on subunit vaccines and how to improve the efficacy of mers subunit vaccines. in addition, we also summarize current animal models for mers-cov and emphasize the importance for evaluation of efficacy of mers vaccine candidates in effective animal models.no currently licensed mers vaccines are available for use. however, researchers are working to develop potential vaccines, and recent successes in the engineering of a replication-competent, propagation-defective mers-cov using reverse genetics provide the possibility of developing attenuated viruses as mers vaccine candidates [47] .sars studies have demonstrated that vaccines inducing strong neutralizing antibodies completely protected immunized subjects against sars-cov infection. moreover, recovered patients infected with sars-cov could maintain potent and persistent rbdspecific antibody responses with neutralizing activity [48] , revealing the significance of neutralizing antibodies in the prevention of sars. like the case of sars-cov vaccines, although vaccines eliciting favorable cellular immune responses may play a role in the clearance of virus infection, vaccines inducing neutralizing antibodies will be sufficient for protection from mers-cov infection. thus, the ability of eliciting neutralizing antibodies is expected to be one of the important criteria for evaluating the efficacy of mers vaccines.previous studies of sars-cov have shown that the s protein, particularly the rbd, may induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies that protected vaccinated animals against sars-cov challenge [43, [49] [50] [51] . it is thus expected that the s protein in mers-cov will also be important for the development of vaccines. song et al. have shown that vaccination with a recombinant-modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing the full-length s protein of mers-cov induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated mice [52] . however, cao and colleagues have reported that although the mva-based, full-length s protein-dependent sars vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses in ferrets, it failed to protect the vaccinated animals from sars-cov challenge. even worse, this vaccine was associated with enhanced inflammatory and immunopathological effects, resulting in serious liver damage in the vaccinated ferrets after viral challenge [53] . therefore, caution should be taken when the full-length s protein of mers-cov is used as a vaccine antigen since the non-neutralizing epitopes in s protein may induce antibodymediated disease enhancement (ade) effects, as those elicited by the s protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv, also a cov) [54] .therefore, it is favorable to develop vaccines based on s protein fragments, particularly rbd, of mers-cov, and such strategy has been reported to be effective in the development of mers vaccines. studies have shown that neutralization against mers-cov infection could be elicited in vaccinated rabbits by a fragment containing residues 358-588 of mers-cov s protein [55] . the induction of neutralizing activity by a recombinant protein fragment containing residues 377-662 of mers-cov rbd has also been demonstrated. particularly, a truncated 212-amino acid rbd fragment containing residues 377-588 (inside rbd: residues 367-606) of mers-cov s protein induced strong mers-cov s-specific antibodies in vaccinated mice, blocking the binding of mers-cov rbd to viral receptor dpp4 and effectively neutralizing mers-cov infection, thus providing promise for further development as an effective and safe mers vaccine [56] [57] .in addition to the s protein, other mers-cov viral proteins might play a role in the development of mers candidate vaccines. however, few studies have addressed this possibility, in particular because mers has only recently emerged as a novel human disease, and vaccine development is a time-consuming process. a recent study reveals that structural and accessory proteins, such as m, orf 4a, orf 4b, and orf 5, of mers-cov may function as potent ifn antagonists [58] , with orf 4a protein showing the greatest potential for counteracting the antiviral effects of ifn by inhibiting ifn production and ifn-sensitive response element signaling pathways. therefore, these proteins may also serve as targets for developing mers vaccines.traditionally, inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines have been the most commonly developed and used vaccine types against viral pathogens, including sars-cov. other types of vaccines, such as those based on dna, viral vectors, virus-like particles (vlps), and recombinant proteins, have also been discussed in terms of their potential application as mers vaccine candidates. because only a few papers related to the mers-cov vaccine development have been published so far, the rest of the review will discuss the development of sars-cov vaccines, from which we can learn what the best strategy is for developing mers-cov vaccine and how to move it forward more efficiently. the main advantages and disadvantages of different strategies for cov vaccine development are listed in table 2 .sars-cov has been tested as vaccine candidates, some of which are proven to be effective to provide protective immunity against sars-cov infection [59] [60] [61] . it was previously reported that a β-propiolactone-inactivated sars-cov vaccine administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to mice was more effective in inhibiting virus replication in the murine respiratory tract than the adenovirus-based n and s vaccine given either intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) [62] . in addition, a live, impaired-fidelity sars-cov vaccine with engineered inactivation of exonuclease activity protects aged and immunocompromised mice against lethal virus challenge [63] . apparently, both local and serum antibody responses can be induced in inactivated sars-cov-vaccinated mice [64] . like sars-cov, it might be possible to attenuate mers-cov by deleting the envelope e protein to diminish virus growth in tissue culture, while abrogating virulence in animals [65, 66] , or by inactivating exonuclease activity. in spite of the possibility of inducing highly potent immune responses and protection, vaccine candidates based on the inactivated and liveattenuated mers-cov might have the potential of recovering virulence, raising safety concerns; as such, this vaccine type may be inappropriate for use by highly immunosuppressed individuals.dna vaccines-dna vaccines consist of a plasmid dna which has been genetically engineered to produce immunological response to protect organisms against diseases. dna is usually administered through two routes, i.m. delivery and bombardment of the skin using a gene gun [67] . currently, two popular theories of dna uptake are used, including nonspecific phagocytosis or pinocytosis and antigen-specific receptor-mediated uptake [68, 69] . containing non-replicating and non-infectious components and only encoding the protein of interest, dna vaccines are safe for use, minimizing undesirable side effects [67] . in addition, vaccines based on dnas are easy to be scaled up by the fermentation technique [70] [71] [72] and are generally stable and inexpensive.the efficacy of dna-based vaccines against sars-cov infection has been widely reviewed. it is revealed that a dna vaccine encoding sars-cov s protein induces neutralizing antibody as well as t cell responses that protect vaccinated mice from sars-cov challenge [73] . in addition, igg antibody and t cell-mediated immune responses are induced by dna vaccines encoding s1 of sars-cov [74] . interestingly, expression of m protein of sars-cov can augment immune responses induced by np protein of a sars-cov dna vaccine [75] . nevertheless, compared with other vaccine types, such as inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines, dna-based vaccines usually have lower immunogenicity [76] , indicating the need to further improve their immune efficacy. although it is possible to use similar strategies to develop dna-based vaccines against mers-cov infection, suitable measures such as priming-boost strategy or combination of dna vaccines with other vaccination types should be considered to improve the immunogenicity of dna-based mers vaccines [77] .viral vector-based vaccines-viral vectors have been applied as an important delivery vehicle for developing candidate vaccines against sars-cov infection. currently, reported viral vectors for sars vaccines include mva, vesicular stomatitis virus, rhabdovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus and attenuated parainfluenzavirus [78] [79] [80] . previous reports have indicated the ability of an mva-based vaccine expressing sars-cov s protein in the induction of neutralizing antibody with protection of vaccinated mice against sars-cov challenge [78] . in addition, a combination of adenoviral-based sars vaccines encoding s1, m and np protein, respectively, induced strong neutralizing antibodies and tcell immune responses, protecting immunized monkeys from challenge of sars-cov [80] . the induction of sufficient cellular and humoral immune responses has also been demonstrated with neutralizing activity by an adeno-associated virus-based vaccine containing rbd of sars-cov in the protection of sars-cov challenge [81, 82] .the above approaches for developing viral vector-based sars vaccines can be adopted for the development of mers vaccines. indeed, mers-cov s protein delivered by an mva vector induces in the vaccinated mice antibody responses with neutralizing activity [52] , bringing some hopes for the development of viral vector-based vaccines to prevent mers-cov infection. however, it should be noted that viral vector-based vaccines do have some disadvantages. for example, some vectors, such as mva or adenovirus, have pre-existing immunity, or cause harmful immune responses [83, 84] and inflammation [85] . thus, cautions should be taken when developing mers vaccines using viral vectors.vlps as vaccines-vlp-based vaccines have been developed as a new generation of non-egg-based, cell culture-derived vaccine candidates against virus infection, and thus have gained much more attention for their potential promise in developing effective and safe vaccines against sars-cov [86] . vlps can be produced in several expression systems, such as mammalian cells (e.g. 293t, cho), yeast, recombinant vaccinia virus and baculovirus expression systems [87, 88] . it is worth noting that the minimal components essential for vlp formation and the immunogenicity induced by vlps need to be considered. although m and e proteins of sars-cov are sufficient for the efficient formation of vlps [89] , the immunogenicity induced by vlps without s protein might be greatly reduced. by comparison, chimeric vlps carrying sars-cov s protein, and e, m and n proteins of mhv-cov elicited high levels of sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies, protecting vaccinated mice from sars-cov challenge [88] .the above findings on sars-cov vlps may be applied to constructing vlps for mers-cov. compared with inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines, vlps do not contain the infectious materials, making vlp technology a promising alternative for mers vaccine development. however, the immunogenicity of vlps is relatively lower than that of inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines. several strategies may be explored to increase the immunogenicity of vlps. for example, dendritic cell-stimulating molecules or toll-like receptor 5 ligand flagellin can be genetically engineered for incorporation into mers-cov vlps to increase immunogenicity and enhance protective efficacy against further heterosubtypic virus challenge [90, 91] .subunit vaccines-compared with other types of vaccines, subunit vaccines can claim several unique advantages. the most important characteristic of subunit vaccines is their safety in that the components only contain synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins expressing specific immunogenic fragments of a pathogen, without the involvement of infectious viruses. additionally, this type of vaccine is less likely to induce side effects at the injection sites, and consistent production can be attained for subunit vaccines because of constant conditions and well-defined pathogenic fragments. the above features have made subunit vaccines an attractive vaccine candidate.like sars-cov s protein, the s protein of mers-cov is also considered an important target for development of subunit vaccines, because it is the main antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune responses. since the s protein contains regions for receptor binding and membrane fusion, s protein-based vaccines are expected to induce antibodies to block virus binding and subsequent membrane fusion or neutralize viral infection [43] . however, the s protein of sars-cov also contains some non-neutralizing epitopes in the immmunopredominant domain [92] , which may induce harmful immune responses [85] . therefore, it is essential to identify and exclude the epitopes in the s protein that may induce harmful or ade responses from the s protein-based mers-cov vaccines.experience from developing rbd-based sars subunit vaccines provides important guidance on the rational design of rbd protein-based mers vaccines. since the rbd of sars-cov contains multiple neutralizing epitopes, rbd-based sars subunit vaccines covering these neutralizing epitopes are able to induce potent neutralizing antibodies completely preventing sars-cov challenge [50, 51] . similarly, it has been shown that the rbd of mers-cov induced strong neutralizing antibody responses against infection of mers-cov [56, 57] and that the mers-cov rbd does, indeed, contain several important neutralizing epitopes [93] . accordingly, further optimization of the rbd and development of optimized rbd-based mers subunit vaccines containing multiple neutralizing epitopes would be desirable and feasible to improve the vaccine efficacy.both mers-cov and sars-cov rbds consist of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. they share a high degree of structural similarity in the core subdomains, but the receptor-binding subdomains are notably divergent [32] . because of variation of the receptor-binding subdomain region within subgroups of the same coronavirus or across different coronavirus groups, it is advisable to rationally design mers subunit vaccines using chimeric s protein containing several neutralizing epitopes from divergent subgroups. this approach will provide a strategic platform for the rational design of subunit vaccines against future emerging covs by focusing on the chimeric s protein containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple virus strains across different subgroups [94] .to summarize, although the inactivated and live-attenuated virus and viral vector-based vaccines are able to induce strong immune responses, their tendency to recover virulence or cause harmful immune responses raises safety concerns for the development of mers vaccines. while dna-based vaccines have a high safety profile, they may be unable to induce highly potent immune response and protection in humans and might cause toxic effect at the injection sites with the repeated vaccinations. by comparison, development of recombinant rbd protein-based mers subunit vaccines remains a high priority, due to a variety of advantages noted above.in spite of a number of merits, protein-based subunit vaccines might have relatively lower immunogenicity as compared with inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines [95] , necessitating continued improvement in the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines. two possibilities are discussed as potential strategies to improve the immunogenicity of mers vaccine candidates.formulation of subunit vaccines with suitable adjuvants-to improve the immunogenicity of mers candidate vaccines, adjuvants should be selected and formulated on the basis of their mechanisms of action. normally, vaccines with limited immunogenicity require the addition of specific adjuvants to stimulate a protective and long-lasting immune response [96] [97] [98] . although a variety of novel adjuvants are now emerging and being investigated, only a few have been approved for clinical use. both aluminum salt-based adjuvants, usually called "alum", and mf59 ™ can induce antigen-specific humoral and ctl responses [99, 100] ; hence, they have the potential for use in mers-cov subunit vaccines. another adjuvant named glucopyranosyl lipid a, a synthetic tlr4 agonist, was also shown to improve the immunogenicity of a protein-based vaccine candidate [101] . other adjuvants, such as montanide isa51, which has been approved for human use in europe [102, 103] , is used in making mers and influenza subunit vaccines, demonstrating a strong ability to promote the induction of highly potent immune responses of these candidate vaccines [56, 57, 104] . furthermore, the combination of two adjuvants with distinct mechanisms of action is also feasible to improve the efficacy of designed mers subunit vaccines. since alum alone cannot induce strong th1 immune responses, it is thus applicable to combine alum with other adjuvants with potential complementary effects in a hope to improve the efficacy induced by alum-adjuvanted subunit vaccines. for example, combination of alum plus glucopyranosyl lipid a will be applied to improve the efficacy of a sars-cov rbd protein-based subunit vaccine [45] . therefore, similar strategies can be utilized in mers-cov subunit vaccines to improve their immunogenicity.selection of suitable administration routes-several administration routes, including i.m., intradermal, s.c., and i.n. pathways, have been used for vaccine immunization in both experimental research and clinical use. the route of vaccine administration directly influences both the quality and quantity of vaccine-induced immunity [105] [106] [107] [108] . traditional parenteral administration routes, such as i.m., intradermal, and s.c., have been shown to induce favorable immune responses and/or protection against sars-cov and mers-cov infections [57, [109] [110] [111] . it is demonstrated that i.m.-vaccination with rbd protein of sars-cov elicits long-term immune responses with neutralizing activity, protecting immunized mice from sars-cov challenge [50] . additionally, potent neutralizing antibodies and protection against sars-cov infection are observed in the mice s.c. vaccinated with sars-cov rbd proteins, respectively, expressed in mammalian cell, insect cell and escherichia coli expression systems [49, 112] . furthermore, strong neutralizing antibody responses are revealed in the mice s.c.-vaccinated mers-cov rbd proteins [56] .in addition to inducing systemic immunity, the stimulation of local immunity at mucosal sites has become an important objective for vaccination. although there some unfavorable features from the i.n. route, such as the possibility of delivering antigens into the central nervous system [113] , as well as the unsuitability for children younger than 2 years and adults older than 50 years, especially those with chronic pulmonary diseases and immunosuppression [114] , the advantages of the i.n. route outweigh its disadvantages. reports have indicated that i.n. vaccination effectively induced both local and systemic immune responses, especially mucosal iga, against mucosal pathogens, cross-protecting vaccinated animals from infection by homologous and heterologous strains of influenza virus [115] , as well as providing long-term protection against sars-cov infection [81] . as an important mucosal pathogen infecting humans via the mucosal pathway [9] , mers vaccines delivered via the mucosal route are anticipated to elicit effective mucosal immune responses, as represented by mucosal iga. intranasal immunization of a subunit candidate vaccine containing recombinant rbd protein fused with fc of human igg has been demonstrated to induce strong anti-rbd-and anti-s1-specific neutralizing antibody responses, particularly iga mucosal immune responses, against infections from mers-cov [93] , providing a fundamental basis for developing effective mers mucosal vaccines.therefore, selection of suitable vaccination routes, combined with antigen formulation with appropriate adjuvants, will play important guidance for developing mers-cov subunit vaccines and further evaluating their efficacy against mers-cov infection.establishment of effective animal models is important for evaluating the efficacy of candidate vaccines against mers-cov. unlike sars-cov, which can infect a variety of animals, including non-human primates, and small animal models such as ferrets, hamsters, and mice [76, 78, [116] [117] [118] , the animal species that could be infected by mers-cov are very limited. it has been shown that mers-cov is unable to replicate in hamsters, ferrets, and mice [119] [120] [121] [122] , significantly restricting the efficacy evaluation of mers vaccines in small animal models. although rhesus macaques can be infected by mers-cov, with the infected animals showing clinical signs of disease and virus replication [123, 124] , the high cost of non-human primate models would prevent the majority of researchers from using this animal model. therefore, the development of effective small animal models for mers-cov infection is urgently needed [125] . it was recently reported that mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing mers-cov's receptor dpp4 were susceptible to mers-cov infection, with the infected mice developing pneumonia and clinical disease accompanied by histopathological changes [126] . nevertheless, a better transgenic mouse model with the gene encoding human dpp4 integrated into its genome has been developed by several laboratories [127] .based on the previous experience in developing sars-cov vaccines, current advancements and potential strategies in the development of mers-cov vaccines have been discussed in this review. apart from inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines, dna-and vlpbased vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines containing the rbd of mers-cov s protein, are critically important. additionally, suitable adjuvant formulation and appropriate administration routes may need to be further considered to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidates. furthermore, development of effective animal models for mers-cov infection is important for evaluating the efficacy of mers-cov candidate vaccines. taken together, the strategies discussed above will have important implications for the development of effective mers vaccines in the future.mers-cov, as a newly emerging coronavirus, has raised worldwide concerns based on its ability to cause increasing numbers of human infections with limited human-to-human transmission, making it particularly important to explore efficient and safe measures for the control of the disease. among these, vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent virus infection. different from other structural proteins (e, m and n), s protein of mers-cov plays a key role in virus infection via s1 binding to viral receptor, followed by subsequent virus and cell membrane fusion via s2. dpp4 was identified to be the cellular receptor of mers-cov. subsequently, the viral rbd was mapped by crystal structural analysis into residues 367-588 and 367-606 in the s1 subunit of s protein. the truncated rbd containing residues 377-588 induced the highest neutralizing antibody response against virus infection in vaccinated animals and thus demonstrating the importance for developing s-rbd-based vaccines against mers-cov. compared with other vaccine types, subunit vaccines possess a higher safety profile, having the potential to elicit stronger immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies. suitable choices in adjuvant formulation and immunization routes can further increase the efficacy of such subunit vaccines, highlighting the need to develop mers-cov subunit vaccines based on the rbd of viral s protein.in the next 5 years, the development of an effective and safe subunit vaccine against mers can be expected. in particular, the development of a subunit vaccine based on the rbd of mers-cov s protein has the greatest potential to contain multiple neutralizing epitopes capable of inducing highly potent immune responses, particularly neutralizing activity, against mers-cov infection. the establishment of effective small animal models for mers infection will allow economical and practical detection of protective efficacy of designed vaccines against challenges from both single and multiple mers-cov strains potentially occurring in humans. the application of similar vaccine development strategies against other covs that might cause human diseases in the future is also anticipated.• first identified in humans in june 2012, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, mers-coronavirus (mers-cov), and is currently causing increased human infections with high mortality.• belonging to lineage c of β-cov, phylogenetically related to bat-hku4 and bat-hku5, mers-cov is the first known lineage c β-cov associated with human infections.• human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 is an identified receptor for mers-cov, and the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of mers-cov has been mapped by crystal structure to the residues covering 367-588 or 367-606, respectively.• a truncated rbd fragment containing a 212-amino acid (residues 377-588) of mers-cov s protein induced strong rbd-specific antibodies, blocking mers-cov rbd binding to viral receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and effectively neutralizing mers-cov infection, providing promise for further development as a mers candidate vaccine.• mers-cov s protein and rbd-based subunit vaccines that contain multiple neutralizing epitopes possess high efficacy to induce strong neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity against mers-cov infection, representing a direction for future design of effective mers vaccines.• subunit vaccines formulated with suitable adjuvants and administered with appropriate routes have a high potential to enhance the immunogenicity of mers candidate vaccines. while many animals are considered reservoirs for covs, the origin of mers-cov and mode of disease transmission still remain unknown. based on a sequence fragment identical to mers-cov found in a taphozous perforates bat captured in saudi arabia, it has been inferred that bats are the most likely reservoir for mers-cov [3] . the identification of mers-cov in dromedary camels and the detection of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of these animals suggest that camels could be the intermediate host of mers-cov [4, 5] . it is thus suspected that mers-cov emerged as interspecies transmission from bats to other animals, such as camels, and then to humans [6] .several family clusters with mers-cov infection have been reported [7, 8] , suggesting human-to-human transmission of the disease. most people who were infected with mers-cov developed severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms like fever, cough and shortness of breath. the virus has an estimated incubation period of 12 days [9] . the transmissibility of mers-cov between humans is currently less efficient than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome cov (sars-cov), which emerged in guangdong province in china in 2002 and re-emerged in 2004, with over 8000 cases and more than 700 deaths in 29 countries throughout the world [10] . nonetheless, the mortality rate for mers (~43%) is much higher than that for sars (~10%) [11] . it has been reported that mers-cov, but not sars-cov, could replicate in cell lines from four major chiropteran families, implying the ability of mers-cov in crossing species barrier between humans and bats [12] . with increased human cases and high mortality rate, mers-cov infection has raised serious global concerns, although it is still too early to implicate any impending pandemic. vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent virus infection. thus, development of effective vaccines is essential to fight against this infectious disease.as proposed by the coronavirus study group of the international committee for taxonomy of viruses (ictv), three groups, 1, 2 and 3, of the coronaviridae family have been commonly accepted as a-cov, b-cov and g-cov, respectively, where the genus b-cov consists of four lineages, namely, a, b, c and d [13] . a novel genus, d-cov, including hku11, hku12 and hku13 identified in birds in 2005, was added in the cov genera [13] .unlike any other previously identified covs, such as a-cov nl63, which was first reported in 2004 [14] , as well as b-cov hku1, which was first discovered in hong kong in 2005 [15, 16] and sars-cov, which caused a worldwide outbreak in 2003 [17] , mers-cov belongs to lineage c of b-cov, and is the first known lineage c b-cov associated with human infections [18] . phylogenetically, mers-cov is closely related to bat covs hku4 and hku5 [19] [20] [21] .mers-cov is a positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus. its genome is about 30 kilobase (kb) pairs in length, consisting of 11 functional open reading frames (orfs) (figure 2 & table 1 ). the viral genome encodes five unique proteins, known as accessory proteins (3, 4a, 4b, 5, 8b), which serve different functions with no known homologs to any other cov proteins.accessory protein 4a, for example, was recently proven to block the production of host interferon (ifn) [22] . although these accessory proteins are not essential for virus replication, recent studies by reverse genetics demonstrated that the absence of the genes encoding these proteins as a group may attenuate viral titers [23] . additionally, the genome of mers-cov encodes six proteins, which are homologous to those of the known covs, including two replicase proteins, orfs 1a and 1b and four major structural proteins, such as spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m) and nucleocapsid (n) proteins (figure 2) [11] . the e protein is a transmembrane protein forming an ion channel on the viral surface. the cov n protein plays an important role in encapsidating the genomic rna and interacting with the m protein and other n molecules [24] .the s protein of covs is a type i transmembrane glycoprotein displayed as an oligomer on the surface of the viral membrane. the precursor s protein contains a cleavage site at which the protein could be cleaved into two non-covalently associated subunits: the distal subunit s1 and the membrane-anchored subunit s2 [25] . the s1 subunit contains the cellular receptor-binding domain (rbd) [26] , while the s2 subunit contains a putative fusion peptide, transmembrane domain and two heptad repeat regions: the heptad repeat 1 and 2 (hr1 and hr2) (figure 3) [27]. figure 3a lists the representative structures of s proteins of aand b-cov nl63-cov, mouse hepatitis cov (mhv-cov) and sars-cov [28] [29] [30] , with the rbds of these cov s proteins consisting of respective core and receptor-binding subdomains. for example, the receptor-binding motif of sars-cov contains residues from 424 to 494, which form a long extended loop with two short antiparallel b-sheets and one disulfide bond between c467 and c474 [31] .similar to the s proteins of other covs, the s protein of mers-cov also contains s1 and s2 subunits, with s1 being responsible for receptor binding and s2 for membrane fusion [32] . unlike covs sars-cov and nl63-cov, which use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as their receptors [33, 34] , mers-cov utilizes human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4, also known as cd26) as its cellular receptor. dpp4 is expressed on primary bronchiolar epithelial cells and regulates the activity of hormones and chemokines through proteolytic cleavage [12, 35] . recent studies have solved the crystal structures of mers-cov s protein alone, or complexed with its receptor dpp4, and mapped the rbd of mers-cov to the residues covering 367-588 or 367-606, respectively [32, 36, 37] . according to the crystal structures, the rbd of mers-cov also contains the core and receptor-binding m a y 2 9 , 2 0 1 3 j u n 2 6 , 2 0 1 3 j u l 2 9 , 2 0 1 3 a u g 2 8 , 2 0 1 3 s e p t 2 0 , 2 0 1 3 o c t 2 9 , 2 0 1 3 n o v 2 9 , 2 0 1 3 d e c 2 2 , 2 0 1 3 j a n 2 7 , 2 0 1 4 f e b 2 7 , 2 0 1 4 m a r 2 6 , 2 0 1 4 laboratory confirmed human cases with mers-cov subdomains, with the receptor-binding motif consisting of 84 amino acids (from v484 to l567) that form a fourstranded antiparallel b-sheet (figure 3b) [32, 36] . similar to other covs, the hr1 and hr2 of mers-cov form a 6-helix bundle believed to drive virion-cell membrane fusion, with three hr1 helices forming the central coiledcoil core and three hr2 chains surrounding the core in the hr1 side grooves [23, 38, 39] . figure 4 describes the crystal structures of sars-cov and mers-cov rbd complexed with their respective receptors, and the major neutralizing epitopes on sars-cov rbd for the neutralizing monoclonal antibody against sars-cov [36,40-42]. understanding of these neutralizing epitopes in rbd of sars-cov will provide useful guidance for the identification of the neutralizing epitopes in mers-cov rbd and, hence designing rbd-based, neutralizing epitope-dependent vaccines against mers-cov.previous reviews on sars have summarized the approaches for the development of effective cov vaccines, pointed out the importance of sars-cov s protein as a target for vaccine and therapeutic development and outlined a roadmap for the product development of a sars-cov rbd protein-based subunit vaccine with manufacturing for future clinical testing [43] [44] [45] [46] . in this review, we will briefly discuss current stages of mers vaccine for mers review informahealthcare.com vaccine development, and provide potential strategies for developing mers vaccines based on the experience from development of sars vaccines, with the focus on subunit vaccines and how to improve the efficacy of mers subunit vaccines. in addition, we also summarize current animal models for mers-cov and emphasize the importance for evaluation of efficacy of mers vaccine candidates in effective animal models.no currently licensed mers vaccines are available for use. however, researchers are working to develop potential vaccines, and recent successes in the engineering of a replication-competent, propagation-defective mers-cov using reverse genetics provide the possibility of developing attenuated viruses as mers vaccine candidates [47] .sars studies have demonstrated that vaccines inducing strong neutralizing antibodies completely protected immunized subjects against sars-cov infection. moreover, recovered patients infected with sars-cov could maintain potent and persistent rbd-specific antibody responses with neutralizing activity [48] , revealing the significance of neutralizing antibodies in the prevention of sars. like the case of sars-cov vaccines, although vaccines eliciting favorable cellular immune responses may play a role in the clearance of virus infection, vaccines inducing neutralizing antibodies will be sufficient for protection from mers-cov infection. thus, the ability of eliciting neutralizing antibodies is expected to be one of the important criteria for evaluating the efficacy of mers vaccines.previous studies of sars-cov have shown that the s protein, particularly the rbd, may induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies that protected vaccinated animals against sars-cov challenge [43, [49] [50] [51] . it is thus expected that the s protein in mers-cov will also be important for the development of vaccines. song et al. showed that vaccination with a recombinantmodified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing the full-length s protein of mers-cov induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated mice [52] . however, cao and colleagues have reported that although the mvabased, full-length s protein-dependent sars vaccine could induce neutralizing antibody responses in ferrets, it failed to protect the vaccinated animals from sars-cov challenge. even worse, this vaccine was associated with enhanced inflammatory and immunopathological effects, resulting in serious liver damage in the vaccinated ferrets after viral challenge [53] . therefore, caution should be taken when the full-length s protein of mers-cov is used as a vaccine antigen since the non-neutralizing epitopes in s protein may induce antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ade) effects, as those elicited by the s protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv, also a cov) [54] .therefore, it is favorable to develop vaccines based on s protein fragments, particularly rbd, of mers-cov, and such strategy has been reported to be effective in the development of mers vaccines. studies have shown that neutralization against mers-cov infection could be elicited in vaccinated rabbits by a fragment containing residues 358-588 of mers-cov s protein [55] . the induction of neutralizing activity by a recombinant protein fragment containing residues 377-662 of mers-cov rbd has also been demonstrated. particularly, a truncated 212-amino acid rbd fragment containing residues 377-588 (inside rbd: residues 367-606) of mers-cov s protein induced strong mers-cov s-specific antibodies in vaccinated mice, blocking the binding of mers-cov rbd to viral receptor dpp4 and effectively neutralizing mers-cov infection, thus providing promise for further development as an effective and safe mers vaccine [56, 57] .in addition to the s protein, other mers-cov viral proteins might play a role in the development of mers candidate vaccines. however, few studies have addressed this possibility, in particular because mers has only recently emerged as a novel human disease, and vaccine development is a time-consuming process. a recent study reveals that structural and accessory proteins, such as m, orf 4a, orf 4b and orf 5, of mers-cov may function as potent ifn antagonists [58] , with orf 4a protein showing the greatest potential for counteracting the antiviral effects of ifn by inhibiting ifn production and ifn-sensitive response element signaling pathways. therefore, these proteins may also serve as targets for developing mers vaccines. the inactivated and live-attenuated sars-cov has been tested as vaccine candidates, some of which are proven to be effective to provide protective immunity against sars-cov infection [59] [60] [61] . it was previously reported that a b-propiolactone-inactivated sars-cov vaccine administered subcutaneously (s.c.) to mice was more effective in inhibiting virus replication in the murine respiratory tract than the adenovirus-based n and s vaccine given either intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) [62] . in addition, a live, impaired-fidelity sars-cov vaccine with engineered inactivation of exonuclease activity protects aged and immunocompromised mice against lethal virus challenge [63]. apparently, both local and serum antibody responses can be induced in inactivated sars-cov vaccinated mice [64] . like sars-cov, it might be possible to attenuate mers-cov by deleting the envelope e protein to diminish virus growth in tissue culture, while abrogating virulence in animals [65, 66] , or by inactivating exonuclease activity. in spite of the possibility of inducing highly potent immune responses and protection, vaccine candidates based on the inactivated and live-attenuated mers-cov might have the potential of recovering virulence, raising safety concerns; as such, this vaccine type may be inappropriate for use by highly immunosuppressed individuals.dna vaccines consist of a plasmid dna, which has been genetically engineered to produce immunological response to protect organisms against diseases. dna is usually administered through two routes, i.m. delivery and bombardment of the skin using a gene gun [67] . currently, two popular theories of dna uptake are used, including non-specific phagocytosis or pinocytosis and antigen-specific receptor-mediated uptake [68,69]. containing non-replicating and non-infectious components and only encoding the protein of interest, dna vaccines are safe for use, minimizing undesirable side effects [67] . in addition, vaccines based on dnas are easy to be scaled up by the fermentation technique [70] [71] [72] and are generally stable and inexpensive.the efficacy of dna-based vaccines against sars-cov infection has been widely reviewed. it is revealed that a dna vaccine encoding sars-cov s protein induces neutralizing antibody as well as t-cell responses that protect vaccinated mice from sars-cov challenge [73] . in addition, igg antibody and t-cell-mediated immune responses are induced by dna vaccines encoding s1 of sars-cov the above findings on sars-cov vlps may be applied to constructing vlps for mers-cov. compared with inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines, vlps do not contain the infectious materials, making vlp technology a promising alternative for mers vaccine development. however, the immunogenicity of vlps is relatively lower than that of inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines. several strategies may be explored to increase the immunogenicity of vlps. for example, dendritic cell-stimulating molecules or toll-like receptor 5 ligand flagellin can be genetically engineered for incorporation into mers-cov vlps to increase immunogenicity and enhance protective efficacy against further heterosubtypic virus challenge [90, 91] .compared with other types of vaccines, subunit vaccines can claim several unique advantages. the most important characteristic of subunit vaccines is their safety in that the components only contain synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins expressing specific immunogenic fragments of a pathogen, without the involvement of infectious viruses. additionally, this type of vaccine is less likely to induce side effects at the injection sites, and consistent production can be attained for subunit vaccines because of constant conditions and well-defined pathogenic fragments. the above features have made subunit vaccines an attractive vaccine candidate.like sars-cov s protein, the s protein of mers-cov is also considered an important target for development of subunit vaccines, because it is the main antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune responses. since the s protein contains regions for receptor binding and membrane fusion, s proteinbased vaccines are expected to induce antibodies to block virus binding and subsequent membrane fusion or neutralize viral infection [43] . however, the s protein of sars-cov also contains some non-neutralizing epitopes in the immmunopredominant domain [92] , which may induce harmful immune responses [85] . therefore, it is essential to identify and exclude the epitopes in the s protein that may induce harmful or ade responses from the s protein-based mers-cov vaccines.experience from developing rbd-based sars subunit vaccines provides important guidance on the rational design of rbd protein-based mers vaccines. since the rbd of sars-cov contains multiple neutralizing epitopes, rbd-based sars subunit vaccines covering these neutralizing epitopes are able to induce potent neutralizing antibodies completely preventing sars-cov challenge [50, 51] . similarly, it has been shown that the rbd of mers-cov induced strong neutralizing antibody responses against infection of mers-cov [56, 57] and that the mers-cov rbd does, indeed, contain several important neutralizing epitopes [93] . accordingly, further optimization of the rbd and development of optimized rbd-based mers subunit vaccines containing multiple neutralizing epitopes would be desirable and feasible to improve the vaccine efficacy.both mers-cov and sars-cov rbds consist of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. they share a high degree of structural similarity in the core subdomains, but the receptor-binding subdomains are notably divergent [32] . because of variation of the receptor-binding subdomain region within subgroups of the same cov or across different cov groups, it is advisable to rationally design mers subunit vaccines using chimeric s protein containing several neutralizing epitopes from divergent subgroups. this approach will provide a strategic platform for the rational design of subunit vaccines against future emerging covs by focusing on the chimeric s protein containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple virus strains across different subgroups [94] .to summarize, although the inactivated and live-attenuated virus and viral vector-based vaccines are able to induce strong immune responses, their tendency to recover virulence or cause harmful immune responses raises safety concerns for the development of mers vaccines. while dna-based vaccines have a high safety profile, they may be unable to induce highly potent immune response and protection in humans and might cause toxic effect at the injection sites with the repeated vaccinations. by comparison, development of recombinant rbd proteinbased mers subunit vaccines remains a high priority, due to a variety of advantages noted above.in spite of a number of merits, protein-based subunit vaccines might have relatively lower immunogenicity as compared with inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines [95], necessitating continued improvement in the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines. two possibilities are discussed as potential strategies to improve the immunogenicity of mers vaccine candidates.to improve the immunogenicity of mers candidate vaccines, adjuvants should be selected and formulated on the basis of their mechanisms of action. normally, vaccines with limited immunogenicity require the addition of specific adjuvants to stimulate a protective and long-lasting immune response [96] [97] [98] . although a variety of novel adjuvants are now emerging and being investigated, only a few have been approved for clinical use. both aluminum salt-based adjuvants, usually called 'alum' and mf59 tm can induce antigen-specific humoral and ctl responses [99,100]; hence, they have the potential for use in mers-cov subunit vaccines. another adjuvant named glucopyranosyl lipid a, a synthetic tlr4 agonist, was also shown to improve the immunogenicity of a protein-based vaccine candidate [101] . other adjuvants, such as montanide isa51, which has been approved for human use in europe [102, 103] , is used in making mers and influenza subunit vaccines, demonstrating a strong ability to promote the induction of highly potent immune responses of these candidate vaccines [56, 57, 104] . furthermore, the combination of two adjuvants with distinct mechanisms of action is also feasible to improve the efficacy of designed mers subunit vaccines. since alum alone cannot induce strong th1 immune responses, it is thus applicable to combine alum with other adjuvants with potential complementary effects in a hope to improve the efficacy induced by alum-adjuvanted subunit vaccines. for example, combination of alum plus glucopyranosyl lipid a will be applied to improve the efficacy of a sars-cov rbd protein-based subunit vaccine [45] . therefore, similar strategies can be utilized in mers-cov subunit vaccines to improve their immunogenicity.several administration routes, including i.m., intradermal, s.c. and i.n. pathways, have been used for vaccine immunization in both experimental research and clinical use. the route of vaccine administration directly influences both the quality and quantity of vaccine-induced immunity [105] [106] [107] [108] . traditional parenteral administration routes, such as i.m., intradermal and s.c., have been shown to induce favorable immune responses and/or protection against sars-cov and mers-cov infections [57, [109] [110] [111] . it is demonstrated that i.m. vaccination with rbd protein of sars-cov elicits long-term immune responses with neutralizing activity, protecting immunized mice from sars-cov challenge [50] . additionally, potent neutralizing antibodies and protection against sars-cov infection are observed in the mice s.c. vaccinated with sars-cov rbd proteins, respectively, expressed in mammalian cell, insect cell and escherichia coli expression systems [49, 112] . furthermore, strong neutralizing antibody responses are revealed in the mice s.c.-vaccinated mers-cov rbd proteins [56] .in addition to inducing systemic immunity, the stimulation of local immunity at mucosal sites has become an important objective for vaccination. although there are some unfavorable features from the i.n. route, such as the possibility of delivering antigens into the central nervous system [113] , as well as the unsuitability for children younger than 2 years and adults older than 50 years, especially those with chronic pulmonary diseases and immunosuppression [114] , the advantages of the i.n. route outweigh its disadvantages. reports have indicated that i.n. vaccination effectively induced both local and systemic immune responses, especially mucosal iga, against mucosal pathogens, cross-protecting vaccinated animals from infection by homologous and heterologous strains of influenza virus [115] , as well as providing long-term protection against sars-cov infection [81] . as an important mucosal pathogen infecting humans via the mucosal pathway [9], mers vaccines delivered via the mucosal route are anticipated to elicit effective mucosal immune responses, as represented by mucosal iga. intranasal immunization of a subunit candidate vaccine containing recombinant rbd protein fused with fc of human igg has been demonstrated to induce strong anti-rbd-and anti-s1-specific neutralizing antibody responses, particularly iga mucosal immune responses, against infections from mers-cov [93], providing a fundamental basis for developing effective mers mucosal vaccines.therefore, selection of suitable vaccination routes, combined with antigen formulation with appropriate adjuvants, will play important guidance for developing mers-cov subunit vaccines and further evaluating their efficacy against mers-cov infection.establishment of effective animal models is important for evaluating the efficacy of candidate vaccines against mers-cov. unlike sars-cov, which can infect a variety of animals, including non-human primates, and small animal models such as ferrets, hamsters and mice [76, 78, [116] [117] [118] , the animal species that could be infected by mers-cov are very limited. it has been shown that mers-cov is unable to replicate in hamsters, ferrets and mice [119] [120] [121] [122] , significantly restricting the efficacy evaluation of mers vaccines in small animal models. although rhesus macaques can be infected by mers-cov, with the infected animals showing clinical signs of disease and virus replication [123, 124] , the high cost of non-human primate models would prevent the majority of researchers from using this animal model. therefore, the development of effective small animal models for mers-cov infection is urgently needed [125] . it was recently reported that mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing mers-cov's receptor dpp4 were susceptible to mers-cov infection, with the infected mice developing pneumonia and clinical disease accompanied by histopathological changes [126] . nevertheless, a better transgenic mouse model with the gene encoding human dpp4 integrated into its genome has been developed by several laboratories [127] .based on the previous experience in developing sars-cov vaccines, current advancements and potential strategies in the development of mers-cov vaccines have been discussed in this review. apart from inactivated and live-attenuated virus vaccines, dna-and vlp-based vaccines, particularly subunit vaccines containing the rbd of mers-cov s protein, are critically important. additionally, suitable adjuvant formulation and appropriate administration routes may need to be further considered to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidates. furthermore, development of effective animal models for mers-cov infection is important for evaluating the efficacy of mers-cov candidate vaccines. taken together, the strategies discussed above will have important implications for the development of effective mers vaccines in the future.expert commentary mers-cov, as a newly emerging cov, has raised worldwide concerns based on its ability to cause increasing number of human infections with limited human-to-human transmission, making it particularly important to explore efficient and safe measures for the control of the disease. among these, vaccination is considered one of the most effective strategies to prevent virus infection. different from other structural proteins (e, m and n), s protein of mers-cov plays a key role in virus infection via s1 binding to viral receptor, followed by subsequent virus and cell membrane fusion via s2. dpp4 was identified to be the cellular receptor of mers-cov. subsequently, vaccine for mers review informahealthcare.com the viral rbd was mapped by crystal structural analysis into residues 367-588 and 367-606 in the s1 subunit of s protein.the truncated rbd containing residues 377-588 induced the highest neutralizing antibody response against virus infection in vaccinated animals and thus demonstrating the importance for developing s-rbd-based vaccines against mers-cov. compared with other vaccine types, subunit vaccines possess a higher safety profile, having the potential to elicit stronger immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies. suitable choices in adjuvant formulation and immunization routes can further increase the efficacy of such subunit vaccines, highlighting the need to develop mers-cov subunit vaccines based on the rbd of viral s protein.in the next 5 years, the development of an effective and safe subunit vaccine against mers can be expected. in particular, the development of a subunit vaccine based on the rbd of mers-cov s protein has the greatest potential to contain multiple neutralizing epitopes capable of inducing highly potent immune responses, particularly neutralizing activity, against mers-cov infection. the establishment of effective small animal models for mers infection will allow economical and practical detection of protective efficacy of designed vaccines against challenges from both single and multiple mers-cov strains potentially occurring in humans. the application of similar vaccine development strategies against other covs that might cause human diseases in the future is also anticipated. in december 2019, the first patient with an atypical form of pneumonia was diagnosed in china, a disease that would later be referred to as covid-19 by the world health organization (who). one month later, in january 2020, the causative agent of the covid-19 disease, the sars-cov-2 virus, was deciphered and identified and its genome was published rapidly (1) .by mid-april, 2020, the extent of impact of covid-19 on the global population was becoming evident. the most adversely affected region per capita was western europe, the most seriously affected population being the elderly, especially those with extensive co-morbidities and weakened immune systems. the causes for regional differences in covid-19 will require months of analysis, if not years, to ascertain. morefocused approaches to reduce the impacts of covid-19 in the near-term, especially on the most vulnerable populations, need to be pursued, in parallel with longer-term approaches to lessen the impact of covid-19 (or other coronavirus-driven diseases) across all demographics. as of mid-april, the very short-term measures that have been implemented to reduce the transmission of sars-cov-2 are the same as those that were taken to reduce the transmission of sars-cov during the 2002-2003 sars pandemic: good hygiene and quarantine, with the latter being far more severe and extensive than the quarantine implemented in 2002-2003. other short-term measures that have been implemented on a very sporadic basis are what can be termed 'tactical treatments'. these tactical treatments do not strengthen the immune system, but rather have the goal of containing the adverse impacts of the viral attack. some examples of tactical treatments that have been tested are eidd-2801, remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, tocilizumab, losartan, to name a few. tests so far have yielded very mixed results.a second avenue being pursued to ameliorate/reduce the effects of covid-19 is development of vaccines to induce viral immunity. the bulk of the present review addresses the status and prospects of this vaccine approach.the third leg of this triad of approaches to ameliorate the ravaging effects (especially for the most vulnerable) of covid-19 is what can be called the 'strategic treatment' approach (2) . this approach has the goal of strengthening the immune system to allow its adaptive component to neutralize the incoming coronavirus without the need for external support. strategic treatments eliminate tangible factors that contribute to weaken the immune system. some examples of such factors, based on existing studies, include titanium dioxide, air pollution, chlorpyrifos, aluminum sulfate, prenatal alcohol exposure, zno, oil fly ash, and many others (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . also the real life exposure scenario in which we are exposed continuously to combination of stressors influences in the long term the immune system and the response of the organism to the viral stressors (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) .tsatsakis et al (15) have shown how pollutants can influence the immune system particularly by modulating ahr pathway and how these effects can be prevented by more strict regulations. while some positive impact may result in the short-term from strategic treatments, their main impact will probably be for the long-term, except for those whose immune systems have suffered irreversible damage or those who have an overwhelming genetic predisposition to immune dysfunction. because strategic treatments appropriate to any specific individual are difficult to identify, and difficult to eliminate because of ingrained habits, some emphasis needs to be placed on those types of treatments that do not require severe lifestyle alterations.this work aims to analyze the strategies and challenges regarding the development of effective vaccines against sars-cov-2. the discovery of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus is an important component of the three-pronged approach described initially, given that the pandemic cannot seem to be entirely stopped by social distancing and good hygiene practices. the tactical therapies identified so far have not been entirely effective, especially for the most vulnerable individuals, being unable to prevent severe disability and ultimately death. while healthcare systems are still struggling not to crumble under pressure from coronavirus patients, research laboratories around the world are competing to produce an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 as soon as possible, in order to be able to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.the development of a vaccine is a complex and time-consuming process, which differs from the development of conventional medicines. normally, the period of development of a vaccine is 12-15 years (16) . while the conventional medicines are oriented towards the treatment of a disease whose symptoms have emerged, vaccines are intended for use in persons not yet exhibiting disease symptoms, in order to prevent the occurrence of diseases (17) . clinical trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of a vaccine focus on demonstrating its ability to prevent the disease, with minimal adverse reactions in the short-term since truly long-term studies in humans are rarely, if ever, conducted (especially on the order of decades), which implies the need to enroll more people than in traditional drug studies (18) .traditional vaccine development methods, although extremely effective in combating highly contagious diseases such as measles, require large amounts of viruses or bacteria, which can last for months. those microorganisms then become the key element in a vaccine, the so-called antigen, that warns the human immune system that some foreign organisms have invaded the body and must be eliminated.vaccines provide the immune system with the necessary instructions for recognizing and mobilizing lines of defense against disease-causing microorganisms, such as bacteria or viruses. in classical vaccines, antigens (distinctive molecular markers) are introduced into the body, originating from inactivated or half-active bacteria or attenuated viruses. these antigens are capable of causing the disease, but are still capable of activating the immune system, and its cells develop antibodies. if the person comes in contact with the native pathogen, the immune system will already have the necessary antibodies ready and will multiply them much faster because it has already been sensitized by vaccination.risk factors for anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine efficacy. global immune deficiency is a risk factor for anti-covid-19 vaccine efficacy, particularly in elderly who have been exposed to a myriad of factors that contribute to weakening of the immune system, as described previously. these factors also result in diseases such as obesity/obesity-related: e.g., type ii diabetes, metabolic syndrome and immune-mediated cancers. mechanistic reasons for these diseases include weakness of antigen recognition, decreased immune cell quantity and functionality, increased level/length and timing of humoral immune alterations of components, reduced initiation of cellular responses, and memory cell disorders. other associations with immunodeficiency include age-dependent humoral and immune cell alterations; immunosenescence; malnutrition (19) ; protein-energy-micronutrient deficit and telomere shortening (20) . in addition, past or current treatments affect the scalable ineffectiveness of vaccines in both older adults (21) and children (22) , especially in immunocompromised (23) .exposure to immunosuppressive drugs (24) or residence in developing countries (25) with a low socioeconomic status is associated with a higher viral mortality compared to residence in developed countries (26) . current global obesity prevalence in adult and children is also a risk factor for anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine inefficacy due to higher levels of il-6 (27) and decreased igg concentrations. parasitic infections, respiratory tract infections such as complicated pneumonia (28) , can also affect subsequent immune response to anti-sars-cov-2 vaccination (29) .adjuvant purity and safety, knowledge gaps of the relative contribution of the innate and adaptive responses to protection against individual pathogens, and the precise mode of action of individual adjuvants (30) are existing negative factors in vaccine efficacy. anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be available by vaccine market players according to current orphan drug (31) and vaccine legislation (32, 33) due to the fight against sars-cov-2 pandemic. this means that design defect, failure to warn, and negligence in testing may also affect vaccine efficacy. under those conditions, long-term safety testing of vaccines in humans will be non-existent. there is no data on whether anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines will be first licensed in developed countries (34) or if all vaccine production facilities will be adequate to assure a reliable supply of new anti-sars-cov-2 vaccines (35) in a timely manner, and are compatible with specifications and improved adult vaccine design strategy by who or immunobiography (36) and heterogeneity of immune responses in the elderly subpopulations (36) .vaccine safety. the safety of the vaccine is initially assessed in laboratory studies with mice or rabbits. if the animals do not show signs of disease after receiving the vaccine, then the tests begin in humans, and the number of subjects gradually increases (37) . duration of the clinical trial, on average, for a classical vaccine (after preclinical stagein vitro and in vivo tests) is as follows (38, 39) :in phase i, also called the first human test, the vaccine is given to a small group of healthy volunteers (10 to 100). the purpose is not to test whether the vaccine protects against the disease, but whether it is safe or whether it causes severe side effects.in phase ii, the candidate vaccine is administered to a larger group of subjects (100-1,000), and in phase iii, to an even larger group (1,000-100,000). separate studies may be required in adults, children and the elderly. it sometimes happens that vaccines that seem safe when given to a small number of people, show side effects when given to a larger number of people. this is explained by the fact that any rare complication is less likely to occur when the group of subjects is small. continuous monitoring is important in case of complications that occur with delayed effect (40) . during a pandemic, these sequential studies may be shortened and partially overlapped, but it is important that thousands of vaccinated people are followed for several months before the general purpose vaccine is approved.if there are more severe signs of inflammation or if the vaccine causes the immune system to malfunction in other ways, the candidate vaccine may not be suitable for widespread use. when such adverse effects are identified, delays in the production process inevitably occur (41) . at present, only two potential vaccines against the sars-cov-2 virus are in the first phase and this by a derogation from the rule -skipped animal studies (fig. 1) .the first vaccine that does not follow all research steps is called mrna-1273 and will be tested in the first phase in seattle. there is an explanation for the speed of approval, which is related to the fact that the coronavirus is not used in the vaccine development. it is an experimental vaccine, made by a new method, based on rna. basically, the rna molecule in the vaccine teaches the cells to produce the disease-specific antigen and trains the body for the real enemy. but there is also a small problem: to date, no vaccine based mrna technology has been approved for any disease, although a few have reached the second phase of testing (42) .the second vaccine is ad5-ncov. the vaccine is created by genetic engineering and tries to teach the body to recognize the coronavirus protein s, which is delivered via a type-5 adenovirus. adenoviruses are a family of about one hundred double-stranded dna viruses that cause various diseases in humans and animals, and type-5 is often used for genetic recombination.although clinical trials have begun for these two candidates and are likely to begin soon for other potential vaccines, it is unlikely to move to phase ii earlier than a few months.vaccine efficacy. vaccines stimulate immunity to the virus, but can also stimulate inflammation in the body. this can manifest itself either as pain or inflammation at the site where the subject was injected, or as general symptoms such as fever or fatigue (symptoms similar to covid-19 disease). for most vaccines, these reactions are mild and affect only a small proportion of subjects.when a vaccine causes the production of antibodies, in mice or in humans, this does not necessarily mean that the vaccine will protect against the disease. ideally, before moving on to human studies, researchers should be able to demonstrate that the vaccine will protect laboratory animals from the disease when they are experimentally infected with the virus. in the case of diseases caused by previous coronaviruses (sars and mers), it was difficult to find an animal species that would be affected by the disease in the same way as humans are affected. however, previous research may help scientists speed up the animal testing process for covid-19. the protective effect of a human vaccine is assessed using a series of studies similar to the series of safety studies. if the vaccine elicits an immune system response, for example if antibodies can be detected in the phase i study, then larger phase ii and phase iii studies can be performed to see if the vaccine protects against infection or disease.although covid-19 is a new disease, research on sars and mers has helped us understand how the human body responds to coronaviruses and how the response of the immune system generates protection against disease (43) . restricted human studies can also be used to calculate the correct dose and schedule for the vaccine. some vaccines generate a strong immune response after a single dose, but others require a booster dose after a month or longer. this strategy also increases the duration of studies.to assess whether a vaccine prevents covid-19 among those exposed to the infection, it should be tested in phase iii studies, in a setting where the infection is actively occurring. in response to the west african ebola outbreak in 2014/15, the rvsv ebola vaccine went through all three phases of clinical development in just 12 months, through the centralized coordination of who, médecins sans frontières. and manufacturer. during this period, there were still cases of ebola in guinea, and the protection of the vaccine was demonstrated by vaccinating the contacts of the residual cases, as they appeared in the community (44) .vaccine manufacturing. in the case of pandemic vaccines, tens or hundreds of millions of doses are needed. this production process takes at least six months, if the production lines already exist. any new vaccine involves a new production process, which involves several quality control steps.the manufacturer must ensure that each vaccine produced is of consistent quality and requires repeated testing. moreover, because vaccine manufacturing is a biological process, inevitably, some batches of vaccines will fail for reasons that are not always clear, which can further delay production. there are quite a few manufacturers in the world that can produce vaccines on a large enough scale to meet the needs of a pandemic.vaccine regulation. before initiating each stage of the human testing process, the developer must provide evidence that the vaccine has early indications of protection and is safe among those who have been tested. research ethics committees review clinical trial plans, and authorities such as the european medicines agency (ema) and food and drug administration (fda) oversee the entire vaccine development process before approving it for general use. these assessments usually take several weeks or months (45) . although such approvals could be shortened in the event of a pandemic, many potential covid-19 vaccines use new technologies, so regulators will not be able to rely on the experience of similar vaccines to speed up the process. developers of the covid-19 vaccine were given a target to produce a vaccine in 12-18 months, while historically, vaccines took 15-20 years to develop. there are diseases against which vaccines do not yet exist, despite decades of work. for example, more than 100,000 children die each year from respiratory diseases caused by another rna virus, rsv (respiratory syncytial virus), which causes pneumonia. despite 50 years of research and 18 products developed, there is currently no rsv vaccine available (46) .numerous scientific research groups are working on the development of a covid-19 vaccine, using a number of different approaches. having many groups in the race is important, as most vaccines entering clinical trials will fail for safety or efficacy reasons.sars-cov-2: a brief summary. sars-cov-2 is part of the coronavirus family, as is sars-cov-1 (which generated the 2003 sars epidemic) and mers-cov (which generated the mers epidemic in 2013) (47) .the new sars-cov-2 coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) causes a respiratory infection called covid-19 (coronavirus infectious disease -2019), with an average incubation period of 5 days (between 2 and 14 days) (48) . the disease is characterized by predominant respiratory symptoms (cough, difficulty breathing, fever) of moderate intensity in about 80% of cases, but may have severe manifestations (bilateral interstitial pneumonia), with progression to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress (ards), the main cause of mortality. there are also cases with gastrointestinal manifestations (especially diarrhea), and in some patients (especially in the young ones) hypo/anosmia (loss of sense of smell) and hypo/dysgeusia (alteration of the sense of taste) have been reported as early symptoms (49) .shortly after the publication of the genetic structure of sars-cov-2, the first two vaccines were developed. sars-cov-2 virus structure is composed of an rna molecule, surrounded by a series of structural and functional proteins (50) . known structural proteins are protein s (or spike -which leads to the characteristic appearance), protein m (membrane), protein e (envelopes), protein n (nucleocapsid). of these, protein s has the role of attaching to receptors in human cells and facilitating the fusion of viral content with the cell. in the case of sars-cov-2, the receptor is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2), which is found in large quantities in the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma (51) (52) (53) (54) . the initial infection of sars-cov-2 occurs in the ciliary epithelial cells of the bronchi (55, 56) .the binding of protein s to ace2 is greatly favored by the existence of the polybase cleavage site -a protein fragment cleaved by the furin enzyme (commonly found in the human body), allowing protein s fragments (s1, s2 and s3) to perform their function. in addition to fusing the viral envelope with the cell membrane, the virus also infects the human cell through endocytosis (the cell membrane around the portion that binds to the virus forms a vesicle inside the cell, detaches from the membrane and introduces the virus into the cell, via that vesicle). through the process of entering the cell, the virus loses its envelope (which fuses with the cell membrane) and the viral rna is free in the cytoplasm, carrying out two processes: replication and transcription. first, the cellular components responsible for rna transcription produce viral proteins, and the rna is copied. subsequently, these proteins and copies of the initial rna are 'packed' into new virions, released from the cell to spread the infection (57) .humoral immunity consists of the production of specific antibodies against these antigens. these are: i) antibodies that appear rapidly during infection and disappear rapidly (igm); and ii) antibodies that appear slower and persist in the body for a long time, even after the infection is cured (igg) (58) . cellular immunity requires training certain immune cells to recognize and destroy the virus. it has been observed in sars-cov-2 infection that the number of cd4 + and cd8 + t lymphocytes is low in the peripheral blood (because they are destroyed in the process of elimination of the virus), but has high concentrations of activation markers (59) . regarding the sars-cov virus, memory cells, capable of recognizing it, have been identified in the blood of healed patients, several years after the infection. the persistence of memory cells is an important element to consider in the development of the anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine (60). cases have been described where the sars-cov-2 infection recurs after being considered cured (61) .on the other hand, there is evidence that coronaviruses are equipped with mechanisms by which they can sometimes evade immune attack. first, after infection of the cell, the vesicles in which the virus is located are lacking in the receptors that could recognize the virus as an 'invader' of the body. second, interferon synthesis (with antiviral function) is inhibited by coronaviruses, and the presentation of viral antigens by pca is low in infected patients (62) .strategies for covid-19 vaccine development. current pandemic of covid-19, caused by sars-cov-2, is a global epidemiological problem, the solution of which will require establishment of large-scale production of the vaccine. given the experience of previous coronavirus outbreaks, showing a high variability of the virus, it is required to develop a vaccine production platform, providing the scalability, technological flexibility, and versatility. these vaccines must provide high efficacy, safety, and tolerability. this is due to the time required to prove that the proposed vaccine is safe and effective as well as the time required to produce millions of doses. many 'candidate' vaccines, which initially look promising, are likely to fail during the testing process. the process of developing a new vaccine begins with a so-called 'candidate' vaccine, which a team of scientists believes to have potential. this is the fastest part of the process and takes up to a few weeks. thus, some candidate vaccines are being for efficient application of sars-cov-2 vaccines, not only the production procedure needs to be developed, but also requires a large-scale production followed by vaccination program targeting muti-million population of different regions. only such a complex approach will allow combatting of the coronavirus disease pandemic. new technologies do not require the work with live virus, making their production much easier, but still needing further scientific and technological evidence (fig. 2) .type of vaccines against sars-cov-2 rna vaccines. the mrna (encoding ribonucleic acid) vaccine encodes a stable prefused form (the form before being fused to the cell membrane of the host cell) of spike protein (s) (63) . protein complex s is required for membrane fusion and host cell infection and has been the target of vaccines against mers and sars.membrane fusion (viral and cellular) is an essential step when encapsulated viruses enter cells. fusion of the double lipid layer requires catalysis to overcome a high kinetic barrier, and viral fusion proteins are agents that perform this catalytic function (64) . although coronavirus uses many different proteins to replicate and invade cells, protein s is the main surface protein that it uses to bind to a receptor -this becomes a bridge to the human cell. after protein s binds to the human cell receptor, the viral membrane fuses with the human cell membrane, allowing the viral genome to enter the human cells and initiate infection (49) .the mrna vaccine against sars-cov-2 is based on a relatively new genetic method that does not require growing the virus in the laboratory. the technique transforms the human body into a 'living laboratory', because the whole process is no longer carried out in the laboratory, but directly in the body that received the vaccine (65).the technique is actually based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mrna) fragments, the genetic material that is copied from dna and encodes proteins. moderna company loads its vaccine with viral mrna, which encodes the proteins of the new coronavirus, and then injects it into the body. immune cells from the lymph nodes process the mrna and synthesize specific viral protein antigens so that other immune cells recognize them (66) . mrna is like a software molecule in the body, which then produces viral proteins that can generate an immune response (67) . how the body processes the viral protein is often very different from the way it processes the same protein of the vaccine. thus, one of the theoretical benefits of introducing mrna into a vaccine is that the body causes the viral protein to behave in exactly the same way that the virus would have directed the host to do (63) ( table i) .dna vaccines. dna vaccines represent the latest direction of development in the manufacture of vaccines. vaccines obtained by recombinant dna technology are produced by genetic modification.the dna encoding the target molecule is introduced via a plasmid or viral vector in a suitable microorganism or cell line, in which dna is expressed and translated into protein.the product is subsequently recovered by extraction and purification. the injected dna is a plasmid plus a promoter that provides immunogenic protein synthesis (69).an advantage of this type of vaccine is that it stimulates both humoral and cellular immunity. also, this type of vaccine is stable and does not require maintenance under controlled conditions (refrigeration), as is the case for conventional vaccines. in contrast to live attenuated vaccines, the risks arising from a potential inadequate attenuation of vaccine strains are not present in dna vaccines (70) . other advantages of this new technology are the fact that the plasmids used are easy to manufacture in large quantities, and the immunity conferred is long-term. the disadvantages identified so far with regard to dna vaccines are due to the fact that this type of vaccine is limited to protein immunogens (71) .a clinical trial for a new dna vaccine against coronavirus has begun. this is called chadox1 ncov-19 and it was initially developed to prevent mers (72) . this vaccine is based on an adenovirus vaccine vector and on sars-cov-2 spike protein (73) . it has been modified so that it cannot be reproduced in the human body and the genetic code that transmits instructions for the production of coronavirus spike protein has been added, allowing the adenovirus to produce this protein after vaccination. the result is the formation of antibodies against the spike protein, known to be on the surface of sars-cov-2 (74).the ino-4800 vaccine is another new dna vaccine to prevent sars-cov-2 infection. it is entering human phase i testing (75) . the phase i study will enroll up to 40 healthy adult volunteers. each participant will receive two doses of ino-4800 every four weeks, and initial immune responses and safety data from the study are expected by the end of the summer. preclinical data have shown promising results in immune response in several animal models. also, the preclinical results for the inovio sars-cov-2 vaccine were consistent with the results of the phase i study for the (table ii) . protein subunit. subunit vaccines contain only certain antigenic determinants of pathogenic microorganisms, and are obtained either starting from conventional cultivation processes, or by recombinant dna technology (76) .antigen determinants included in the vaccine increase the efficiency of the immune response, and the presence of a small number of pathogens reduces the risk of side effects. subunit vaccines mainly contain surface fragments of pathogens. because these types of structures are weak immunogens, to obtain vaccines with suitable efficacy, the antigens are conjugated with protein molecules (77) .antigen purifiers sometimes lead to loss of immunogenicity, requiring coupling with a protein carrier or with an aluminum salt. however, adjuvants are associated with the onset of local reactions to the vaccination site. also, the duration the immunity conferred by vaccination is lower, except for live vaccines (78) (table iii) .viral vectors. along with traditional virus vaccines, viral vectors are widely used, in which genome of one virus is used to deliver the antigen of another virus, thus allowing development of a platform technology of virus production. these technologies are available for large-scale production of vaccines. drawbacks of such vaccines include a large variation of purification methods, need for a reliable confirmation of purity and activity of the virus (79) (tables iv and v) .vlps (virus-like particles). vaccine development based on the recombinant proteins and virus-like particles (vlps) is a more innovative approach. antiviral vaccines are usually developed on the basis of surface proteins that form vlps. production of vlps in the cells with further reconstruction into the stable and immunogenic forms is a multi-stage process. substantial issues appear for the vlp production for non-enveloped viruses. nucleic acid based vaccines are very interesting from the platform technology viewpoint, allowing the same process to be used for the production of different antigens. they elicit both humoral and cell immune responses (80) .production of these vaccines may be based on e. coli cell fermentation and corresponding technologies of extraction and purification of plasmids ensuring their structural integrity (81) (table vi) .inactivated virus. another category of vaccines is vaccines containing whole microorganisms, but inactivated by chemical or physical methods. this type of vaccine has the advantage of higher stability; however, effectiveness is lower and requires reminders of immune system. vaccines with inactivated live virus require stabilization of the structure in the dry form, separate supply of the solvent, and cold-chain transportation. these factors complicate the production process and lead to increase of their cost (82) (table vii) .live attenuated virus. live attenuated vaccines were the first vaccines utilized. these types of vaccines are obtained through cultivation of microorganisms under suboptimal conditions or through successive passage in cultures, techniques that determine attenuation of virulence while maintaining the capacity to induce the immune response (83) .although characterized as very effective, live attenuated vaccines have the disadvantages of risks related to the possible occurrence of mutations, leading to the virulence reversal, as well as contra-indication in the case of immunocompromised persons (table viii) .others. the lv-smenp-dc vaccine (lentiviral minigene vaccine, shenzhen geno-immune medical institute) entered phase i clinical trial in march 2020. it is a vaccine based on dendritic cells modified with a lentiviral vector expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domains, and is administered with antigen-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes (84) .pathogen-specific aapc vaccine (shenzhen geno-immune medical institute), phase 1 clinical trial (85) is based on lentiviral vector modified artificial antigen presenting cells (aapcs) expressing synthetic minigens based on selected viral protein domains. the challenges of covid-19 vaccines. where do we stand? the development and manufacture of a covid-19 vaccine is an urgent issue, but it is likely to take many months to resolve. although many companies have announced that the covid-19 vaccine will be ready soon, this will be quite difficult to do in reality (72) .the main reason is that before being put on the market, the vaccine should be safe, both in the short-term and in the long-term. this is very important because, in the history of vaccine production, there have been situations of (16) . for example, one third of the polio vaccines administered in the us between 1955 and 1963 also contained simian virus 40 (sv40) and more recently, rotavirus vaccines have been discovered to also have swine circoviruses (86) (87) (88) .in order to avoid such situations, everything to be tested on humans should first be checked for purity, and then sterile production lines provided. this takes time. in rare cases, certain antibodies generated by immunization may promote an aggravated form of the disease (a situation called ade, antibody dependent enhancement) (89) . when these antibodies re-establish contact with the virus, they will actually help it enter the cells and cause infection. ade has been described in many viral infections (influenza, dengue, zika, etc.), but also in coronaviruses. the mechanism of ade has not been confirmed for coronavirus in humans (90) .several animal studies have shown that some types of anti-sars and anti-mers vaccines, although effective in generating antibodies, can lead to more severe forms of disease when the virus is subsequently inoculated (91) .the second reason is that the vaccine must not only be safe, but also effective. it must be able to determine the synthesis of antibodies of a certain type, at a certain concentration (titer) and to provide protection for a reasonable time. however, vaccines never generate immunity to all vaccinated people (92) . the causes are complex and vary from genetic and immunological factors, to the quality of the vaccines themselves and how they are administered.age is an important aspect and some influenza studies have shown that aging of the immune system dramatically decreases the effectiveness of vaccination (93) . therefore, for any future anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine, all these aspects should be evaluated, and the primary immunization failures minimized by adjusting the doses or number of administrations.assuming that the vaccine will generate an effective immune response to a sufficient number of individuals among those vaccinated, the time frame of vaccine protection is questionable (94) . for example, after measles vaccination, a small percentage of those who initially respond well, lose their protective antibody status within a few years, a phenomenon called secondary immunization failure (95) . this is why it takes time to check the post-vaccination persistence of anti-covid antibodies. last but not least, both safety and efficacy are significantly dependent on the type of vaccine, i.e. the technology or platform used.some technologies are very new and therefore require more careful testing. others are old but need to be adapted for covid-19. another aspect is not only the ability of a company to develop the technology, but also its large-scale production capacity so that it is quickly accessible globally. because there is no commercially available anti-sars-cov-2 vaccine precedent for the proposed platforms, completely new production lines, capable of generating billions of doses in a few months, must be considered. and this must be done without stopping the production of current vaccines, already included in the official protocols and guidelines. at present, this capacity will be reached with difficulty and will represent an unprecedented effort. dna and rna vaccines are based on the principle of insertion of these nucleic acids in some cells of the vaccinated ones, forcing them to make immunogenic viral proteins (96) . although some recent data seem encouraging, these concepts have questionable efficiency in humans. non-replicative vectors are actually common viruses (e.g., adenovirus) genetically modified to display sars-cov proteins on the outer surface (97) . but they are so common that many of us have already met with them throughout our lives and as a result, we already have immunity and neutralize them before they do their job.the attenuated viruses would be variants of sars-cov-2 made less or not at all pathogenic by genetic engineering. they are by far the most immunogenic, but there is a risk that they will become pathogenic after mutations (98) .inactivated viruses, viral fragments, and synthetic peptides are all relatively weakly immunogenic. the analysis of these variables is normally done over 10 years, in the form of a trial. the stages of a trial are inflexible, standardized, intensely regulated for the purpose of maximum safety and efficacy of the final vaccine.the first stage is the preclinical research, in which the technology that will be included in the vaccine is selected and then the efficacy and safety profile of human cells (in vitro) and animal models (in vivo) is tested. if the expected anti-infectious effect is seen in vitro, and cells do not die excessively, then in vivo animal studies are conducted. mice are usually the perfect candidate for in vivo studies, because they are about 85% genetically similar to humans, relatively inexpensive, and do not raise major ethical issues (99) . however, one of the notable differences between the human and the mouse is fixed in the case of the ace2 receptor gene (to which sars viruses bind during infection). mice simply do not make the respiratory syndromes, they eliminate the virus relatively quickly from the body. this is why it is necessary for either the genetically modified mouse to have a human ace2 receptor, or to use ferrets and monkeys, and this makes everything much more expensive and more difficult to access.the preclinical stage lasts between 1½ and 2½ years and is by far the most selective. it is estimated that less than 20% of the vaccines tested are able to progress to human tests. some fail because the product does not work, others because they can no longer find financing (1, 100) .after obtaining the vaccine, the first people vaccinated will be the highest risk categories. for everyone else, the term is sometime in 2022, possibly long after we have naturally acquired immunity.there are still many unknowns related to coronavirus immunity and that is why obtaining a vaccine is difficult. future mutations in sars-cov-2 could occur at any time, which automatically means a high risk of any vaccine becoming useless. no vaccine has been obtained for any other coronavirus so far, and no one can guarantee its success yet. it is possible that we will have the anti-covid vaccine in a very short time, without having the benefits from long-term testing results. the vaccine will probably not be available to all of us for 18 months.scientists began working on coronavirus vaccines during sars and mers outbreaks, but their efforts did not materialize because of a myriad of difficulties. since this extremely severe current coronavirus pandemic, covid-19, the spread of the outbreak appears much broader than was the case for sars. there is also the possibility of the disease becoming endemic and seasonal in its appearance, according to some investigators. this explains why many research groups and companies are undertaking efforts to develop an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 all over the world, also speeding up all the usual phases needed to develop and test a vaccine in the human.an important feature in the landscape of vaccine research and development for sars-cov-2 is represented by the varied range of evaluated technological platforms, including nucleic acids (dna and rna), virus-like particles, peptides, viral vector (replicative and non-replicative), recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses and inactivated viruses. many of these platforms are not currently the basis of vaccines already authorized, but experience in areas such as oncology encourages developers to exploit new opportunities for increased development and manufacturing speeds.there is not an effective therapy for severe covid-19, and social distancing is extremely 'costly' from a social and economic perspective. therefore, the development of an effective vaccine, along with efforts to implement immune-enhancing strategic treatments and shorter-term efforts to identify tactical repurposed treatments, should be considered major public health priorities. we hope to get this key tool for disease prevention, and to do this quite soon.it is unknown whether there ever will be a successful sars-cov-2 vaccine, but the efforts of the scientific community in attempting to develop such a vaccine is without precedent. thus, covid-19 vaccines are a never ending story.why challenge trials of sars-cov-2 vaccines could be ethical despite risk of severe adverse events nir eyal t he deep health, economic, and social crisis the world is in as a result of the covid-19 pandemic cannot be sustainably resolved without a proven vaccine against the novel coronavirus. 1 as experts consider ideas for accelerated testing of vaccine candidates, 2 one approach is to replace conventional phase iii testing, the longest and most expensive phase of clinical research, with human challenge trials (also known as controlled human infection trials). challenge trials could replace conventional efficacy testing either completely 3 or, by weeding out unpromising vaccine candidates before conventional testing, in part. either way, challenge trials could make testing-in multi-arm adaptive platform trials, 4 for instance-faster and more manageable.in a human challenge trial, healthy participants are intentionally exposed to a pathogen. this helps researchers find out fast whether participants earlier randomized to the vaccine under investigation are protected more than the participants in the control group (who will have typically received a placebo). results come much faster than in conventional phase iii testing, in which significant differences between the group that received the vaccine and the control group start surfacing only months later, as participants (who typically try to avoid exposure as much as they can, for example, by donning protective gear) get exposed to the pathogen. if an outbreak moves elsewhere before many participants are exposed, conventional phase iii testing fails to complete-which normally cannot happen in challenge trials.human challenge trials are regularly done for seasonal flu, typhoid, and malaria, 5 with the typical justification that "carefully controlled experiments involving intentional infection often pose only minor risks, " 6 because, for example, the disease is mild or therapies are available. that justification probably fails for a live sars-cov-2 challenge since there are deadly risks (although participant selection could make death unlikely enough to respect commonly assumed limits on tolerable risk in consensual clinical studies) 7 and, at this correction added on 28 may 2020, after first online publication: funding information is added to the acknowledgments.& point, no proven cure. 8 while there are also technical questions about how much challenge trials could accelerate testing for the novel coronavirus, 9 this article defends the ethics of coronavirus challenge studies on the assumption that, technically, they could substantially accelerate testing-and widespread rollout.f air and benefi cent treatment of participants in a challenge trial depends not simply on reducing the likelihood of severe clinical outcomes (such as fatality) in the study, for participants might have experienced similar or worse events anyhow, and it makes no sense to hold such outcomes against the protocol. th e trial should reduce (for each participant and for the entire cohort) how much that likelihood exceeds that of commensurate bad outcomes for the same people under two alternative scenarios delineated below, which do not involve participation in that particular study.th e idea is straightforward. doctors off er patients surgeries and toxic drugs that may result in severe clinical outcomes, or they experiment with new interventions, all the time. th ese approaches are perfectly justifi ed when the doctors thereby save these same patients from greater likelihood of similar bad events without the treatment or the experiment. one thing that is worse than getting your belly cut for an indicated operation is not undergoing that indicated operation because, say, you are uninsured. th e operation injures you and puts you at risk, but it usually brings a net benefi t. to move from the fact that an injured belly would, in itself, be a harm and a source of risk to the conclusion that being uninsured is a blessing would be fallacious. in assessing the risks and the benefi ts to study participants, research ethics heeds not simply the risks of study participation. it also heeds the balance of incremental risks and incremental benefi ts from participation, which matters much more. 10 th is calculus applies to human challenge trials as well. what matters in assessing the off er that researchers make to candidate participants is not simply the socalled absolute risk, 11 better described as the raw or contributing risk, that comes with the challenge-whether viral exposure poses only minor or controllable risks or, alternatively, more serious ones-but the net risk: the risk from participating in that trial minus the risk that the same person would face otherwise. in other words, what matters is the full balance of personal risk and benefi t. th e evaluation of a challenge trial ought to look at the diff erence the trial would make to the participant's health (or life). an institutional review board, for example, should heed the change in risk exposure that would apply to the participant because she would be in the trial and not in some alternative scenario.for judging the ethics of a sars-cov-2 challenge trial, two alternative scenarios to participation in the challenge trial are especially pertinent. in one, a person declines to participate in any sars-cov-2 vaccine effi cacy test. th at scenario helps identify how trial participation may aff ect that person overall, for good and for ill. in another, the same person participates in the competing form of trial, namely, a standard effi cacy trial for the same vaccine. th e latter would result in delay, but it may be tempting to argue that it is kinder to study participants and hence more ethical. to compare personal risks between the two studies, we shall look at the participant's (average) counterpart in the effi cacy study, whether or not the participant of the challenge trial can herself join a standard effi cacy study.i t turns out that, compared to either of these two alternative scenarios, both for each individual and for the cohort, the net risk from participating in a sars-cov-2 vaccine challenge would be negative, small, or unclear. th e net risk could not be clearly very large. diff erently put, a sars-cov-2 challenge trial may turn out to constitute indirectly benefi cial research for study participants-so that they would be medically disadvantaged if ultimately excluded from it or if they were admitted to a standard effi cacy trial instead. properly done, a challenge trial certainly would not expose participants to a known far higher prospect of net harm than would either of these alternatives.how might introducing a sometimes deadly and incurable pathogen into the body of a perfectly healthy person improve that person's health and welfare prospects? th e explanation lies in the peculiarities of the current pandemic, which features a highly transmissible virus and overwhelms health systems worldwide. for any individual, the probability of incurring death or disability from an infection is a x b, where a stands for the probability of getting infected, and b stands for the probability of either dying from or developing a longterm disability as a result of the infection. what is a x b if an individual participates in a challenge trial? what is it if she declines? what is it if she participates instead in a standard effi cacy trial? is the probability largest in the fi rst case, and by enough to justify blocking willing and decisionally capacitated adults from enabling highly valuable trials? to gauge the magnitude of a x b in a challenge trial versus outside any trial versus in a standard effi cacy trial, let us look separately at a and at b in each of these three scenarios.when people assume that challenge trials are very dangerous to participate in, they usually focus on a (the probability of getting infected under these three scenarios). for any candidate participant, the likelihood of getting infected is clearly greater with the challenge trial's artifi cial challenge than if the person either declines to participate in any trial or participates in a standard effi cacy trial. however, in the sars-cov-2 case, the research team can and should select participants for whom the probability of infection is least larger in a challenge trial. recent models predict widespread worldwide exposure to this coronavirus. some areas are likely to experience infection rates of greater than 50%, 12 and the proposal is to recruit only from areas with ongoingly or expected high transmission rates. 13 since the world is a large and variegated place, and candidate selection can be careful and targeted, there should be many outlier areas, among which to choose, where the probability of getting infected later would be very high at the time of candidate selection. because expedited vaccine trials could shorten the current global economic recession and prevent many deaths worldwide, it would make perfect sense to invest in carefully selecting and then safely transporting a few hundred healthy candidate participants from high-transmission areas to the isolated research centers-even across international borders. in light of the public health emergency, related red tape should be removed. if participants are selected in that way, the challenge trial is much likelier to hasten participants' exposure than to impose an exposure that they would have otherwise avoided. in the rare event that exposure kills a participant, the earlier exposure could mean that the individual dies a few months sooner than if exposed to the virus outside the trial design, but this temporal factor seems less signifi cant than the substantial eff ect trial participation could have on how likely the person is to die.with appropriate trial procedures and smart participant selection, b (the probability of dying or developing disability if infected) would be smaller in a challenge trial. it may be much smaller. first, the proposed trial design includes frequent monitoring that may catch disease and enable participants to receive supportive care and any therapeutics proven by that point very early, probably before any complications develop. 14 outside the challenge trials, by contrast, testing could be scarce, and many carriers could remain asymptomatic, which impedes a "test-and-treat" approach that may be deemed promising for some patients. any therapeutics proven by then might not be universally available yet. it would be only prudent and fair toward trial participants to prioritize them for any novel therapeutics. 15 challenge trials for a sars-cov-2 vaccine should also off er guaranteed access to standard-of-care life-sustaining treatments, including immediate assistance during cardiac arrest. as life-support services reach capacity in many parts of the developed world over the coming months, patients from high-transmission areas who develop severe disease will oft en die outside trials. it is true that, according to reports published so far, most covid patients who rely on critical care do not survive, 16 but, crucially here, younger covid patients who need critical care tend to survive. 17 in the united kingdom, for example, of the covid patients aged 16 to 39 whose critical care outcomes were reported by may 15, 2020, 81.9% they could actually be smaller. had been released from critical care. 18 it is also true that a period in intensive care for covid-19 treatment may leave patients physically or psychologically disabled. 19 but the option of receiving critical care, which significantly helps prevent the very worst outcome of shortterm fatality, is clearly a substantial medical benefi t. because, for young patients with severe covid-19, the absence of life-sustaining interventions makes a big difference between likely survival and no chance at all, the probability of averting death in the event of infection would be substantially better inside a challenge trial than outside any trial. and this probability would be somewhat larger than in a standard effi cacy trial, which would fi nd it somewhat harder to provide that full guarantee of support to its thousands of participants.in short, if researchers conducting challenge trials act as recommended, admittedly, the probability of getting infected would remain larger inside a challenge trial than either outside any trial or in a standard effi cacy trial; but the probability of death or disability is likely to be much smaller inside a challenge trial than in these alternative scenarios. overall, a x b could be smaller for any individual inside the challenge trial than either outside any trial or in a standard effi cacy trial. what the individual would lose in the probability of averting infection (with that probability rising) she could gain in better protection from death.even if, eventually, with more data and calculations, a x b turns out to be equal under these alternative scenarios, or slightly better under them, here is what is unlikely to be the case, dynamic and uncertain data notwithstanding: that a x b is much, much smaller if a properly selected and treated individual does not participate in any trial or if she partakes in a standard effi cacy trial instead. th is matters. in espousing a limit on how risky participating in a trial may justifi ably be, contemporary research ethicists usually describe what exceeds that limit in terms of extremely high net risk to the participant; the limit is surpassed only when the overall balance of prospective medical harms and medical benefi ts to the participant is highly adverse. 20 th ere is another important welfare or borderlinemedical benefi t from participation. some potential challenge participants simply could not extinguish risk of getting exposed, say, because they have to leave home for essential work. th ey could not extinguish it either by declining to participate in any trial or by participating in a standard effi cacy trial instead. among them, those who live with others would understandably worry about infecting household members, including, in some cases, old or frail relatives. th ey would know that if reinfection is rare or impossible (something that scientists are still examining), they would not infect them as long as their own infection and infectious period take place in isolation. putting at least a temporary end to the risk of infecting others would help keep their loved ones alive-surely a substantial benefi t. 21 by contrast, if they do not join any study or if they participate in a standard effi cacy study, the probability of infecting those dearest to them could remain substantial.all in all, so long as challenge participants are selected and supported as recommended above, the prospective harms, properly understood as the incremental harms, are unlikely to far exceed the benefi ts for individual participants. th ey could actually be smaller.to sum up so far, the answer to the right question, about the appreciation in net risk, is that, on balance, challenge trial participation could be either prospectively benefi cial or neutral or slightly prospectively harmful-certainly not highly prospectively harmful. th erefore, it cannot justify paternalistic protection when adults with the requisite decision-making capacity wish to help researchers do enormous good.c onsider fi ve potential objections to the argument i have laid out. exploitation. one objection is that my argument compares participation in a challenge trial to the wrong scenarios. th e correct comparison, it could be objected, is to idealized circumstances-of greater justice. otherwise, a vaccine producer might exploit unjust background strife of candidate participants to off er them less safety than it should. 22 to exploit someone is, roughly, to use their unjust disadvantage to one's unfair advantage, leaving them with less than they should have. 23 for example, a sweatshop owner makes to potential workers a worse off er than she should (the pay is unfairly low, and the degree of safety is not what it should be), exploiting their alternatives, which are, unfairly, even worse-starvation, for instance. th e fundamental problem here may have to do with the distributive consequences, say, that the owner winds up with too much, and the workers too little; or with the workers' eff ective inability to decline the off er; or simply with the perverse relation in which the owner stands to them. whatever the fundamental problem may be, we usually consider this problematic. and inasmuch as widespread infections and lack of access to critical care fl ow from injustices, one could claim that recruiters for human challenge trials or the societies they serve are likewise exploiting an unjust disadvantage. instead, one could argue, the appropriate comparator of participating in a challenge trial is living in a world free of these injustices or their disadvantageous sequelae. indeed, two senior french doctors were recently condemned for having proposed testing coronavirus vaccines in african patients, based on assumptions about african nations' fi nancial inability to fi ght the virus eff ectively. 24 while the backlash probably had more to do with unsympathetic, and somewhat racist, suggestions that these doctors made on the occasion, the potential exploitation of background economic injustices may also have been a concern.th e challenge trials i discuss here would probably take place in leading research centers in the richest countries. but inside these countries, transmission rates and the need for unavailable critical care services may typically end up being worst in impoverished, minority, and undocumented migrant neighborhoods, among the uninsured and underinsured, and among other victims of societal injustice. some unethical historical challenge trials were done on such participants, improving these participants' overall risk exposure compared to their unjust alternatives. 25 while these historical comparisons are obviously inappropriate (given that these abuses also involved violations of consent, of independent review, and so forth), 26 their unethical nature may also have involved the exploitation of background injustices. 27 does the potential for that kind of exploitation undermine my case for testing sars-cov-2 vaccines through the challenge trial design?th ere is a simple answer to the concern about exploitation. to avoid preying on victims of injustice likely to live in certain areas, all research teams need to do is recruit elsewhere. th e world is a big place, and, unfortunately, there will be plenty of areas with ongoing and expected high transmission, as well as devastating de-mand for critical care services, even absent grossly unjust background poverty, disparities, lack of insurance, and the like. some locales are experiencing or can expect a surge in covid-19 cases for reasons other than preexisting systemic injustice-simply because of bad luck or even warranted choices that panned out poorly (for example, governments may not have invested a great portion of health care funds in intensive care units and supplies in the years before the pandemic, in favor of investing in cost-eff ective interventions that, over time, promote population health and longevity more). researchers could always focus recruitment on such locales. indeed, although researchers should recruit from high-transmission areas, those need not be areas of the very highest transmission rates if the latter locales correlate closely with background injustices. some other areas that are generally better-off would do. of course, it is impossible to project which locales will have become high-transmission areas when it is time to test the effi cacy of each candidate vaccine. for illustrative purposes, however, consider middle-class areas of stockholm, if social democratic sweden's recent choices to avoid social distancing turn out to have been epidemiologically mistaken (not quite the same thing as unjust). 28 again, transporting a few hundred candidate participants from afar, even across borders, to the research center is a rational fi nancial and administrative investment toward alleviating a deep recession.a second answer is that, in this instance, research teams may be able to recruit volunteers driven not solely by promoting their own health but also by altruism. th e nonprofi t 1day sooner is collating contact details of potential volunteers for live sars-cov-2 challenge trials and reports over 21,000 applications at the time of this writing. 29 many potential volunteers study or teach at elite academic institutions. many are self-identifi ed "effective altruists" who recount past altruistic acts. while self-reports ought to be taken with caution, it may turn out that enough participants would volunteer with full comprehension of the medical risks, perhaps out of altruism and not because of misunderstanding-and not because they have suff ered systemic injustice that makes them vulnerable to exploitation. avoiding fi nancial incentives for participation would further help select volunteers with the best motives. 30 th e causal route to their e r h & participation would not exploitatively rely on off ering benefi ts to thwart major injustices toward them.a third answer is that the ethics around nonexploitation is complex. avoiding exploitation, as defi ned above, would mean that some victims of injustice are denied any benefi ts of trial participation and that many people like them, of the same racial minority, for example, or as undernourished as they are, are denied the benefi t of the vaccine's having been tested in people like them. th e upshot of showing that an action would be exploitative is therefore unclear. sometimes, it is much better to be exploited than not to be exploited.finally, even if exploiting unjust strife were unavoidable in challenge trials of sars-cov-2 vaccines, concerns about exploitation would not be strong enough to unseat the otherwise very strong case for these trials. it is true that, even with a study volunteer's willing consent and even given the need to thwart a public health disaster, some research ethicists (not all) 31 would consider high likelihood of grave harm to a volunteer to remain forbidden. 32 but no one i know seriously argues that worries about benefi cial, perfectly consensual research that is marred merely by an exploitative route to benefi t and consent is enough to ban a study that can be expected to save an inordinate number of lives. remember that the challenge trial design could cut several months in the wait for vaccine rollout, translating into thousands or millions of lives spared from exponential growth in direct covid deaths. 33 true, only a third to one half of all vaccine effi cacy trials lead to vaccine approval, 34 and there is some chance that none of the over 100 extant vaccine candidates will work or that an approved vaccine will not be rolled out widely. but even a portion of the potential lives that might be spared, thanks to sars-cov-2 vaccine challenge trials, from covid death, from death or serious harm from other diseases that are neglected during the pandemic, and from famines and halted economic development during months of delay could be a very large number of lives spared.put more dramatically, the main factor resting on one side of the moral scale is a signifi cant chance at averting a great number of deaths-probably vastly more than in the 2014-2016 ebola outbreak (with 11,315 deaths) or even the 2004 indian ocean tsunami (with around 250,000 deaths). what stands on the other side is not averting serious net harm to an individual, which is the consideration that some research ethicists count more. th e complaint on that side is that, while, admittedly, challenge trial participation could benefi t that individual on balance and she could rationally and autonomously choose to enroll, the causal roots of that benefi t are impure. th is is not a balance that would stop any serious research ethicist from approving a crucial trial.for all these reasons, the concern about exploitation, even if applicable and cogent, cannot unseat the initial case for conducting challenge trials. th is is not to say that researchers should ignore that concern. it may aff ect how best to conduct the trials-say, by recruiting from areas with high transmission rates but no blatant injustices. still, some form of challenge trial remains permissible and, to accelerate vaccine rollout, highly recommended ethically.inability to decline. challenge trials should enroll individuals only with their fully free and informed consent. 35 but with some medical trials, just or unjust background circumstances are so dire that they leave candidate participants no reasonable option except to enroll.perhaps that is what troubles ethicists who consider challenge trials and warn about dire background injustices. it may also be part of what worries some about the quality of consent in trials of novel cancer therapeutics, which give terminal patients a last hope to fi ght off a cancer that is irresponsive to approved treatments. 36 in a sense, these desperate patients cannot (because they cannot aff ord to) say no and are "forced" to participate. in english, when one chooses the less bad of two bad options, one is oft en said to have been "forced" or "compelled" to make that choice. 37 all this may seem to invalidate any consent that people in dire circumstances may give to trial participation and may make their inclusion in the trial unfree and, one could argue, wrongful. and, given the eff ects of the current pandemic, anyone joining a challenge trial for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus may be said to be "forced" to participate.th is argument that bad alternatives to trial participation invalidate consent to participate cannot work. it would forbid many ordinary participant selection procedures for cancer therapy research. it could even, absurdly, invalidate consent to advanced cancer care, on the parallel ground that the patient cannot aff ord to say no. but the argument is even more questionable when applied to vaccine research. th e risk profi le of someone who knows that she has advanced cancer is very diff erent from that of someone who-like vaccine trial recruits-has not been infected and is therefore at far less dramatic risk. especially if research teams recruit only young and healthy individuals, for whom even infection is highly unlikely to translate into severe disease, recruits should not feel desperate or compelled to participate in the trial for their own health's sakes. what i argued above is only that there are health benefi ts from participation, not that recruits should feel desperate for them. if some persistently do, they should be excluded in the consent process for misunderstanding relevant facts, or on psychiatric grounds. in that respect, since we should permit these cancer studies, we should also permit human challenge studies of novel coronavirus vaccines.vaccine safety. some vaccine candidates may turn out only in effi cacy testing to be toxic. 38 some may turn out only during effi cacy testing to enhance covid-19 severity, manifold. 39 th e greater the chance for vaccine safety issues, the better in that respect for individuals to decline to participate in trials. 40 th is may suggest that participating in the challenge trial is prospectively harmful, aft er all.let me off er four responses. first, challenge trial participants would prospectively benefi t in other ways and so may still prospectively benefi t overall-this risk notwithstanding. second, that chance for vaccine safety issues is as likely per person to arise in standard effi cacy trials. assuming that some form of effi cacy testing of vaccines is legitimate in this crisis, this factor should not weigh against challenge trials. th ird, in standard effi cacy trials, toxicity and severe disease are much less safe for participants because they erupt in the fi eld, not in a controlled medical environment with frequent monitoring and guaranteed medical help. 41 th erefore, vaccine unsafety is far more dangerous to a participant in a standard effi cacy trial than to one in a challenge trial. fourth, in standard effi cacy trials, any risk of toxicity or enhanced severity accrues to 10 to 50 times as many participants, for the simple reason that such trials require 10 to 50 times as many participants. in short, appropriate concern about enhanced severity cannot constitute an advantage of standard effi cacy trials over a human challenge trial. quite the contrary. it only strengthens the ethical case for challenge trials to replace standard effi cacy testing of vaccines against the novel coronavirus.indirect benefits. i have argued that if challenge trials are done right, the incremental risk from participation in them may be smaller than the incremental benefi t from it. th e main benefi t invoked was priority access to critical care and therapeutics in the event of severe covid-19. however, that benefi t may seem irrelevant or tertiary to some, either because harm allegedly matters more than benefi ts or because this particular benefi t is indirect.contempt for "mere" benefi ts merits only a short response. researchers, as well as clinicians, appropriately off er countermeasures known to be riskier when the expected benefi ts exceed the expected risks. while some benefi ts (such as mere enhancement and mere fi nancial benefi t) might be less important than a trial's primary benefi t to the participant, others are clearly as important. th e benefi ts discussed here are in terms of avoiding covid-19 fatality-the main risk under consideration; indeed, it is not even clear what counts as reduction in incremental risk and what as increase in incremental benefi t. 42 what is worth further discussion is the worry that these life-saving benefi ts are nevertheless merely indirect because they would not "aris[e] from receiving the intervention being studied. " 43 nor is treatment for covid-19 among "the clinical benefi ts of the procedures that are scientifi cally necessary to test the experimental intervention under study. " 44 an anonymous reviewer of an earlier version of this article thought that indirect benefi ts should not count toward the assessment of study participants' balance of personal risks and personal benefi ts, lest researchers "address" any major risk with fi nancial compensation or still other indirect benefi ts.however, for the purposes of this article, we can set aside the question whether money can ever adequately compensate for acute medical risk. again, priority access to covid-19-related critical care is a medical, not a fi nancial, benefi t. it directly addresses the main risk of challenge participation, namely, premature covid-19-related mortality. how can such an indirect benefi t not count?in addition, some benefi ts from participation in a covid-19 challenge trial would be direct benefi ts. consider potentially better protection for one's family (if infection provides long-term immunity) and a safer environment for episodes of enhanced disease severity, compared to the environment for standard effi cacy trial participants. th ese benefi ts emanate directly from the best scientifi c way to hold the study.furthermore, scholars who have looked at indirect benefi ts usually propose including them in institutional review boards' risk-benefi t calculations 45 or even on informed consent forms. 46 in fact, the (questionable, in my view) regulatory block on invoking indirect benefi ts pertains in the united states only to research on people who cannot provide informed consent, such as children, 47 and is irrelevant to the present case of challenge trials on decisionally capacitated adults. 48 even the benefi t of better access to critical care and therapeutics in a challenge trial than in one's hightransmission area is borderline direct. while not strictly speaking "scientifi cally necessary to test the experimental intervention under study, " this care would be part of trial safety. it is not ancillary care or retroactive compensation for a trial that risks covid-19 fatality. instead, it preempts high risk of covid fatality resulting from the viral exposure in the study.access to critical care is also ethically owed to study participants, per most accounts of research ethics, anyhow. critical care is not experimental treatment that, as such, might not be owed. nor is it in rich countries so exquisitely rare that, despite participants' especially strong claim to it, they should be denied it. not to offer critical care would be preposterous in a challenge trial for a deadly disease that critical care helps treat. far from an aft erthought to appease those protesting an unfair risk-benefi t ratio, critical care is owed in the fi rst place.personal risk factors. what if a candidate participant who hails from a high-transmission area actually has low risk of getting infected for a reason that sets her apart from her neighbors, such as being personally willing and able to isolate herself extraordinarily well? th en there is an important sense in which trial participation could harm that individual greatly. in the trial, exposure would be certain, whereas outside the trial, it would remain unlikely. 49 researchers should go some way toward identifying and excluding such individuals (for example, by asking about candidate participants' work and household arrangements or even surveying them on risk behavior). perhaps informed consent forms should exhort candidate participants to consider personal risk factors and avoid participation if they are highly unlikely to get exposed naturally. however, just as some participants would have less risk of natural exposure than researchers could know, others would have greater risk of natural exposure than researchers could know. researchers should ascribe to candidates the average risk level for the risk category package they investigate. by sticking with the average, non-omniscient researchers are as likely to introduce more net harm than expected as they are to introduce less net harm than expected. it should all balance out. and the risk exposure that researchers are ethically responsible for is arguably the one that they know (or could with reasonable eff ort fi nd out) about, not the objective one discussed here.a s i have argued, the right ethical question about human challenge trials for sars-cov-2 vaccines is not the commonly raised one, about their likelihood of leading to deaths and other severe adverse events, given the disease's seriousness and the current lack of proven therapeutics. th e right question is whether challenge trials would increase study participants' likelihood of similar bad outcomes, compared to two alternative scenarios: nonparticipation in any trial and participation in standard effi cacy trials for the same vaccines. as shown, surprisingly, compared to these two alternatives, human challenge studies would, on balance, probably benefi t or at least not dramatically harm study participants. challenge trials could also reduce the overall prospect of harm in the participant cohort.with respect to sars-cov-2, ethicists should not advocate a ban on a trial design that may accelerate a proven vaccine's rollout by months just because risks were calculated the wrong way. let us not miss our chance to quash the current global crisis earlier through perfectly permissible research.a further conclusion follows. based on the ethical requirement to give participants a fair balance of risks and benefi ts, it need not be important to recruit indi-viduals or a cohort who would be at low risk of bad outcomes in the trial. th e balance of risks and benefi ts may turn out to be similar for participants who would be at low risk in the trial (such as young and healthy individuals) and for ones who would be at high risk (such as older people and individuals who have relevant underlying health problems). it may turn out that, compared to these alternative scenarios, challenge trial participation is prospectively benefi cial (or not very harmful) for all potential recruits, including high-risk ones.if and when that is indeed the case, it would seem compatible with sensibly calculated risk-benefi t requirements to recruit for a challenge trial not only young and healthy people, 50 for whom both risks and benefi ts are low. it would also seem permissible to recruit old people and people who live with health conditions that make them especially vulnerable to covid-19, people for whom both risks and benefi ts are high. all could benefi t, or at least not lose a lot in their prospects, compared to if they do not participate and compared to if they participate in a standard effi cacy trial.recruiting an ample number of participants from several such vulnerable populations may allow us to skip further testing for vaccine safety, 51 or effi cacy, in populations earlier excluded from the effi cacy study, and move straight to conditional approval and, alongside further rigorous testing in broader populations, wide rollout. additional months would be saved in the race to a universal vaccine rollout.other ethical considerations may be thought to weigh against recruiting older patients and patients with conditions that increase risk from infection. one is that their recruitment could increase the risk that some patients would die from trial procedures, undermining public trust. another is that for these higher-risk populations, the benefi t of guaranteed access to therapeutics and life-sustaining interventions in the event of severe infection might be crucial enough to "force" them to participate, in the sense expounded above. whether these two considerations are sensible and weighty enough to forgo cutting additional months from the process is a question that i shall leave for another day. vaccination is one of the most significant public health interventions ever made, sparing millions of people from infectious diseases. it has been calculated that use of currently available vaccines saves more than eight million lives annually, which corresponds to one person saved every five seconds. these remarkable results have been achieved in 200 years of vaccination history, which are largely based on two basic, simple technologies: the inactivation of toxins and pathogens with formaldehyde treatment (first performed by glenny and hopkins in 1923 and ramon in 1924) [1] [2] [3] , and the stable attenuation of pathogens by serial passage in vitro.from 1920 to 1980, these now "easy technologies" were applied to develop vaccines that have been used worldwide to control or even eradicate many infectious diseases. one of the most brilliant successes of vaccination is the eradication of smallpox virus in 1977. it has been estimated that to date, smallpox eradication has spared the global community of some 350 million new smallpox victims and about 40 million deaths from the disease. the annual savings as a result of vaccination being stopped and hospitals being able to be converted to other uses is estimated to be in excess of us$ 2000 million each year [4] .vaccination has also resulted in the elimination of poliovirus from the americas in 1994, western pacific in 2000 and europe in june 2002. the goal of the who global polio eradication initiative is to interrupt transmission of wild poliovirus by end-2004 leading to global certification by 2008. overall, since the initiative was launched in 1988, the number of cases has fallen by over 99%, from an estimated 350,000 cases to the 89 cases reported in the first three months of 2004. in the same period, the number of polio-infected countries was reduced from 125 to 6 [5] .moreover, the incidence of seven other frightening diseases (diphtheria, measles, rubella, mumps, pertussis, haemophilus influenzae type b -hib -, and tetanus) has fallen by more than 98% in those states where the related vaccines have been introduced (see tab. 1).chiron vaccines, via fiorentina 1, 53100 siena, italythe historical technologies for vaccine production have achieved remarkable successes, but the battle against infectious diseases has not been won. during the last several million years of existence on earth, microorganisms have learnt how to escape the surveillance of our immune system, either hiding themselves from host responses, or developing the capacity of infecting different hosts. these two main mechanisms of pathogen defense explain why vaccines against several pathogens such as hiv, hcv, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, plasmodium falciparum, schistosoma spp. and others are difficult to develop and are not yet available.moreover, during the last 25 years, there has been a big revolution in microbial ecology: pathogens that have circulated since many years, but whose existence was ignored were discovered (hcv, metapneumovirus, etc.); old pathogens have changed their geographical habitat and have been introduced into new areas where they have become endemic (e.g. west nile virus in north america); completely new pathogens have emerged and pose a serious threat to human health (hiv, sars coronavirus, etc); pathogens thought to be controlled have re-emerged (mycobacterium tuberculosis, etc.) (tab. 2).it was soon clear that the old vaccine strategies were unable to face with the new challenges posed by infectious diseases, and modern approaches were needed. therefore, from the beginning of the 1980s, taking advantage of the better understanding of the immune system and the emergence of the recombinant dna technologies, new vaccines were developed (tab. 3). moreover, nowadays the range of technologies and strategies available for vaccine development is extremely broad. the availability of the whole genomic sequences of many pathogens is considered a real revolution and table 1 . universal routine vaccination reduced by more than 98% the incidence of nine harmful diseases from the us and eradicated two of them (smallpox and polio).max it is now common knowledge that the capsular polysaccharide of many important bacterial pathogens is their major virulence factor and that vaccination using purified polysaccharides could protect people from those diseases. polysaccharide vaccines have been developed against neisseria meningitidis serogroup a (mena), group c (men c), group y (meny), and group w135 (men w135) in the late 1960s [6, 7] , against h. influenzae type b in the 1980s [8] , against 23 types of streptococcus pneumoniae in the early 1990s [9] , and against salmonella typhi in the mid 1990s [10] . however, the use of all these vaccines is inadequate. polysaccharides are t-independent antigens: their immunogenicity and efficacy is very poor or absent in infants, so that they are unsuitable to be included in the infant routine immunization schedule. the solution was found by covalently linking the sugar to a carrier protein (conjugation). this procedure converts t-independent antigens into tdependent ones by providing a source of appropriate t-cell epitopes (present in the carrier protein). conjugation technology is one of the biggest achievements of the novel vaccination strategies. the capacity of transforming poor immunogens such as polysaccharides into excellent immuno-novel vaccination strategies 79 the first conjugate vaccine developed was the one against haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) [11] . hib is a respiratory pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of human infections. before the availability of the hib conjugate vaccine, hib was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis, especially in infants, in most developed and developing countries worldwide, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. the first hib conjugated vaccine was introduced in the us in december 1987 for children 18 months of age and older; subsequently, more immunogenic vaccines were introduced, in us as well as in many other countries, in the early 1990s, for the use in infants from the age of two months. within a few years, the effectiveness and public impact of hib conjugate vaccines on hib disease has been demonstrated in all those countries that have introduced the vaccination [12]. in the us, the annual cases of hib invasive disease among children under five years of age decreased from more than 20,000 of the pre-vaccination era [13] , to less than 50 in 2002 [14] .in general, the decrease in incidence of disease has exceeded that predicted on the basis of estimated proportion of the population that is completely immunized, suggesting that the vaccine use is able to generate herd immunity. on this topic, many studies have shown that hib conjugated vaccines are able to reduce nasopharyngeal carriage [15-18], which gives a major contribution to herd immunity. precisely how hib conjugate immunization reduces nasopharyngeal colonization, whether this impact is due to decreased acquisition or decreased duration of carriage is not clear. additional work on the immunology and microbiology of transmission and carriage is needed to clarify this issue. on the other hand, reduction of hib carriage may open ecological niches for h. influenzae non-type b strains 80 maria lattanzi and rino rappuoli . the seven serotypes in the first licensed conjugate vaccine account for > 80% of isolates from blood and cerebrospinal fluid of children aged < 2 years in the us, compared with < 60% of isolates from older children and adults in us, and with < 60% of isolates from young children in latin america and asia [25, 26] . the seven-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine has been recommended in us for all infants as three primary doses (approximately at 2, 4, and 6 months of age) and one booster dose at the ages of 12 and 15 months [27] . this vaccine repeated the successes of the hib conjugate vaccine, showing high efficacy in preventing meningitis and efficacy, although to less extent, in preventing pneumonia [28] and acute otitis media [29] due to the vaccine serotypes. moreover, several studies have established that the conjugate vaccine is effective also in reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of the serotypes covered by the vaccine, potentially extending the benefits beyond those children who are vaccinated. post licensure evaluation of the efficacy of the seven-valent conjugated vaccine found that the reduction in disease was greater than the percentage of children who have been vaccinated, with evidence of herd immunity [30] .neisseria meningitis group c conjugate vaccines began clinical development at the end of the 1980s, and, after extensive clinical studies during the 1990s, were proved to be safe and capable of inducing highly bactericidal and boostable immune responses in infants and children [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . these vaccines were first introduced in the united kingdom in late 1999, to be used for a countrywide vaccination initiative. population-based active surveillance monitored age-specific and capsular group-specific incidence of disease and estimated vaccine coverage [40] . the results were impressive: within 18 months of vaccine introduction, the cases of menc diseases almost disappeared in the vaccinated population, with an estimated vaccine efficacy of 90%, or above, in all targeted age groups [41] . according to a large carriage study performed in the united kingdom, the vaccine induced also a 66% decrease in the carriage of menc strain, with no evidence of any increase in carriage of menb isolates or other capsular groups [42] . moreover, the vaccine provides some evidence of herd immunity, as there is also a reduction of menc disease in unvaccinated individuals ranging from 34 percent (9-14 years old) to 61 percent (15-17 years old) [43] .since 1999, the menc conjugate vaccine has been licensed in many european countries and also in canada and australia, either as routine infant immunization, or for catch-up programs of varying forms.multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines containing groups a, c, y, and w135 are in clinical development. introduction of these vaccines into routine infant and/or toddler immunization programs could have a substantial effect on the incidence of meningococcal disease [44, 45] .in the 1970s it was discovered that protection towards hepatitis b is correlated to the presence of antibodies against the surface antigen of the virus (hbsag), which circulates in the bloodstream of infected subjects in large quantities. these discoveries led to the development of first generation, plasma-derived hbsag subunit vaccines, first licensed in the us in 1982 [46] . concerns about safety of blood products and the advances of recombinant dna technology conducted to the development of second-generation recombinant subunit vaccines produced in yeast or in mammalian cells [47] , which were first licensed in us in 1986. the application of the recombinant dna technology has the advantage to produce safer vaccines than the plasma-derived ones and in unlimited supplies. this recombinant hbv vaccine is highly effective: a standard course of three doses induces protective levels of anti-hbs (i.e. >10 miu/ml) in over 95% of healthy infants, children and adolescents and in more than 90% of healthy adults younger than 40 years. after the age of 40, immunogenicity drops below 90%: however, and by the age of 60 years, 65 to 75% of vaccinees develop protective anti hbs titers [48] [49] [50] . moreover, the vaccine prevents development of chronic hepatitis in at least 75% of early-vaccinated infants born from hbeag-positive mothers [51] .cost-benefit analyses have strongly supported the introduction of universal immunization against hbv to newborns [52] . since 1992, the who has called for all countries to add hepatitis b vaccine into their national childhood immunization schedules, and substantial progress has been made in implementing this recommendation: by the end of 2003 more than 160 countries worldwide will have introduced the vaccine [53] . substantial help in achieving this goal has been given by the global alliance for vaccines and immunization (gavi) and the vaccine fund, which since 2000 began to provide technical and financial support to introduce routine hbv immunization into 71 of the world's poorest countries [54] .the effectiveness of routine infant hbv immunization in significantly reducing or eliminating the prevalence of chronic hbv infection has been demonstrated in a variety of countries and settings. the experience in taiwan is particularly impressive. universal vaccination decreased the prevalence of hbsag carriage in children younger than 15 years of age from 9.8% in 1984 to 0.7% in 1999 [55] . moreover, rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) among cohorts of children born after routine infant immunization have started in the mid 1980s declined by greater than 50% [56] . these results clearly show that the hbv vaccine is the first successful anti-cancer vaccine, opening the way to other anti-cancer vaccines like vaccines against human papilloma virus (hpv) that causes cervical cancer [57] , or helicobacter pylori, responsible for many gastric cancers [58] .the first example of a vaccine developed with a new rational strategic design, taking advantage of the power of the molecular biology and genomic technologies is the recombinant acellular pertussis vaccine.a vaccine composed of the whole, killed bordetella pertussis cells has been available for mass vaccination since the late 1940s [59] . this vaccine is very efficacious in preventing the disease, but the presence of severe adverse reactions, although no proof exists of their having been caused by the vaccine, brought about a drop in vaccine compliance in the 1970s and stressed the need for a new safer vaccine.a considerable amount of work was initially required to identify the bacterial antigens responsible for the induction of protection. pertussis toxin (pt) was then identified as a major protective antigen, while other antigens, such as adenylate cyclase, filamentous haemagglutinin (fha), pertactin and the fimbriae, were found to provide some help in protective immunity. several researchers developed acellular pertussis vaccines containing purified pt inactivated by the old classical chemical treatment with formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. however, it is recognized that this treatment of pt may be associated with significant reversion rates [60] .to overcome these problems, the pertussis toxin was detoxified by using the powerful tools of molecular biology to make stable changes, by sitedirected mutagenesis, to the amino acids responsible for the toxicity of pertussis toxin. this molecular approach allowed the development of a natu-rally nontoxic molecule, inactivated by a rational design that did not need a denaturing chemical treatment [61] .the genetically detoxified pt had successfully shown its safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials, both in adult volunteers and in infants and children, either as a monovalent mutant pt alone [62, 63] , or in association with fha and pertactin [64, 65] , and also with fha and pertactin in association with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (dtap) [66, 67] . these trials showed that the different acellular vaccine formulations containing the non-toxic pt mutant were extremely safe, and much safer than the wholecell pertussis vaccines. furthermore, all formulations induced high titers of anti-pt neutralizing antibodies and very strong antigen-specific t-cell proliferative responses. interestingly enough, five to six years after the primary immunization schedule, this vaccine still exhibited an efficacy of about 80%, and both antigen-specific antibody and cd4 + t-cell responses were still detectable at significant levels [68, 69] .the new strategy used to develop this genetically detoxified acellular pertussis vaccine shows that this approach can provide tremendous advantages, eliciting very high, protective immune responses with very low amounts of antigen.despite the introduction of these new strategies (conjugation, recombinant dna etc.), one of the major issues for the development of new vaccines is the identification of protective antigens from a microorganism. biochemical, immunological and microbiological methods have been successful in many cases, but they require the pathogen to be grown in laboratory conditions, are time-consuming and allow for the identification only of the most abundant antigens, which can be purified in quantities suitable for vaccine testing. unfortunately, in many instances the most abundant proteins could not be good vaccine candidates. moreover, the antigens expressed in vivo during the infection could not be expressed in vitro to the same extent. furthermore, when dealing with non-cultivable pathogens, there is no approach to vaccine development.the availability of the complete genome sequence of a free-living organism (h. influenzae) [70] marked the beginning of the "genomic era" that opened novel strategies in vaccine design. the possibility of determining the whole sequence of a genome (bacterial, viral or parasitic) led to the idea of using the genomic information to discover novel antigens that have been missed by conventional vaccinology. this approach, called "reverse vaccinology", involves the computer (in silico) analysis of the microbial genome sequence and predicts those antigens that are most likely to be vaccine candidates [71, 72] . the success of genomic-based strategies for vaccine development is highly dependent on the criteria used for the in silico selection of the potential antigens, which are usually secreted or extracellular proteins, more easily accessible to antibodies than intracellular ones. several approaches can be used to mine genomic sequences, and the appropriate combination of various algorithms and the critical evaluation of the information generated are essential for the proper selection of the antigens.the in silico approach results in the selection of a large number of genes. therefore, it is necessary to use simple procedures that allow large numbers of genes to be cloned and expressed, like robotics and pcr. the product of each pcr reaction is cloned and screened for expression in a heterologous system. successful expression depends on the predicted localization of the protein. integral transmembrane proteins have proven to be particularly difficult to produce by recombinant techniques in e. coli.once purified, the recombinant proteins are used to immunize mice and the post-immunization sera are analyzed to verify the computer-predicted surface localization of each polypeptide and their ability to elicit a quantitative and qualitative immune, protective response.the genomic approach has many novel features and advantages. there is no need to cultivate the pathogen. as the whole process starts in silico, it could be equally applied to cultivable and non-cultivable microorganisms. pathogens dangerous to handle can be studied as easily as commensals. virtually all protein antigens encoded by the pathogen's genome could become vaccine candidates, regardless whether they are expressed in vitro or in vivo, abundant or scarce. this process allows the identification of all the antigens seen by the conventional methods and the discovery of novel antigens that work on a totally different paradigm.unfortunately, reverse vaccinology suffers from limitations related to our incomplete knowledge of vaccine immunology: a rate-limiting step of the process is linked to the rarity (or, more often, absence) of widely accepted correlates of protection and reliable animal models of infection. the other constraint of this approach is the inability to identify non-protein antigens such as polysaccharides, and cd-1 restricted antigens such as glycolipids, which represent new promising vaccine candidates.meningococcus b represents the first example of the application of the genomic approach and the demonstration of the power of this novel strategy for target antigen identification [73] . conventional approaches to menb vaccine development have been ineffective for more than 40 years. a capsular polysaccharide-based approach, which has been extremely successful for other major meningococcal serogroups, cannot be used for this strain, because the menb capsular polysaccharide is identical to a widely distributed human carbohydrate (α(2-8)n-acetyl neuraminic acid, or polysialic acid). this condition not only makes the polysaccharide a poor immunogen for humans, but also a potential generator of autoantibodies. on the other hand, a protein-based approach, developed using surfaceexposed proteins contained in outer membrane vesicles (omvs), has shown to have efficacy in clinical trials only against homologous strains, especially in children below five years of age, because of the high sequence variability of the major protein antigens [74] .using the reverse vaccinology, dna fragments were screened by computer analysis while the n. meningitidis sequencing project was in progress. the screening was aimed to select proteins predicted to be on the surface of the bacterium or to have homologies to known bacterial factors involved in pathogenesis and virulence. after clearance of cytoplasmic proteins and known neisseria antigens, 570 genes predicted to code for surface-exposed or membrane-associated proteins were recognized. successful cloning in e. coli and expression was achieved for 350 proteins, which were then purified and tested for localization, immunogenicity and protective efficacy in animal models. of the 85 proteins found to be surface exposed, 22 were able to induce complement-mediated bactericidal antibody response, which is the most convincing indication of the capability of inducing protective immunity. in addition, to test the appropriateness of these proteins as candidate antigens for conferring protection against heterologous strains, the proteins were evaluated for gene presence, phase variation and sequence conservation in a panel of genetically diverse menb strains representative of the global diversity of the natural n. meningitidis population. most of the selected antigens were able to induce cross-protection against heterologous strains, demonstrating that these new antigens are good candidates for the clinical development of a vaccine against menb [73, 75] .it is impressive to notice that within only 18 months the genomic approach allowed the discovery of more potential vaccine candidates than the previous 40 years of conventional research.the success of the menb project, together with the availability of an increasing number of genomic sequences and the faster and faster development of bioinformatics tools, has encouraged the application of the reverse vaccinology approach to many other pathogens. nowadays, this approach is widely used to develop vaccine candidates against those pathogens for which conventional approaches have failed so far. the potential of the genomic approach is so extensive that it could be used not only for bacteria, but also for viruses and parasites.despite the successes of the conjugate vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae (see above), the absence of cross protection between the different serotypes, with the threat of serotype replacement by strains that are not represented in the vaccine composition, makes it unsuitable for universal use [20] . to identify more appropriate vaccine candidates, the whole genome sequence of s. pneumoniae was scanned and 130 potential orfs with significant homology to surface proteins and virulence factors of other bacteria were identified [76] . 108 of these proteins were effectively expressed in e. coli and used to immunize mice; six of them were able to confer protection against pneumococcal challenge in a mouse sepsis model. flow cytometry confirmed the surface localization of these new proteins. furthermore, each of the six protective antigens showed a high degree of cross reactivity against the majority of capsular antigens that are expressed in vivo and are immunogenic during human infection, providing a good base for the development of improved vaccines against s. pneumoniae.streptococcus agalactiae, or group b streptococcus, is the leading cause of bacterial sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis in neonates in us and europe [77] . as for s. pneumoniae, the capsular polysaccharide is the major protective antigen, but at least nine different seroptypes exist with little or no cross protection [78] . therefore, a protein-based vaccine is required to overcome serotype differences.the complete genome of a serotype v strain of s. agalactiae was determined and analyzed [79] . the genome is predicted to code for 2175 orfs of which 650 were predicted to be exposed on the surface of the bacteria. approximately 350 of these orfs were successfully expressed in e. coli and used to immunize mice. using the sera in elisa and flow cytometric analysis against intact bacteria, it has been demonstrated that 55 of these proteins are in fact measurably expressed on the surface of the bacterium. these new antigens are now being evaluated in in vitro and in vivo models for their capacity to protect against invasive infection by group b streptococcus.to identify vaccine candidates for staphylococcus aureus, an approach based on genomic peptide libraries and well-characterized human sera was developed [80] . s. aureus peptides were displayed on the surface of e. coli via fusion to one or two outer membrane proteins (lamb and fhua) and probed with sera selected for high antibody titers and opsonic activity. the exhaustive screening of the two different peptide expression libraries by the application of macs technology (magnetic cell sorting) enabled the profile of antigens that are expressed in vivo and that are able to elicit an immune response in humans to be identified. a total of 60 antigenic proteins were identified, most of which were predicted to be secreted, or located on the surface of the bacterium, and their antibody-binding sites were mapped. these antigens represent promising vaccine candidates for further evaluation.a process very similar to the one used to develop a vaccine against menb was used also for porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen implicated in the etiology of chronic adult periodontitis [81] . from a genomic sequence of 2000 genes, 120 were selected using a series of bioinformatics tools. the selected genes were cloned for expression in e. coli and screened by western blotting using sera from human periodontitis patients and animal antisera. this subset of 40 recombinant proteins were then purified and used to immunize mice, which were subsequently challenged with live bacteria in a subcutaneous abscess model. two of these recombinant proteins (showing homology to pseudomonas sp. oprf protein) demonstrated significant protection in the animal model and therefore could represent potential vaccine candidates [82] .chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular parasite with a complex biphasic lifecycle: an extracellular infectious phase characterized by a spore-like form, the elementary bodies (eb), and an intracellular replicating stage characterized by the reticular bodies (rb). the pathogen is a common cause of community-acquired acute respiratory infections and more recently has also been associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [83] .because of the technical difficulties in working with c. pneumoniae and the absence of reliable tools for genetic manipulation, not much is known about the cell surface composition of the eb. to define the surface protein organization of c. pneumoniae, a systematic genomic and proteomic approach was used [84] . the approach is based on six main experimental steps: (i) in silico analysis of the c. pneumoniae genome sequence to identify genes potentially encoding surface proteins (including outer and inner membrane and periplasmic proteins); (ii) cloning, expression, and purification of selected candidates; (iii) use of purified antigens to generate mouse immune sera; (iv) analysis of sera specificity by western blotting of total eb extracts; (v) assessment of antigen localization by facs analysis on whole ebs; and (vi) identification of facs-positive antigens on bidimensional electrophoresis (2de) maps of c. pneumoniae eb proteins. the results of this systematic genome-proteome approach represent the first successful attempt to define surface protein organization of c. pneumoniae and raise the possibility to find suitable candidates for a purified vaccine.currently licensed anthrax vaccines have been developed during the 1960s and are based on cell-free filtrates containing mainly the protective antigen (pa). pa is the common cell-binding domain capable of interacting with two different domains, the lethal and the edema factors, which elicit cell damage. these vaccines, originally licensed for selected veterinary personnel, textile workers and abattoir workers, have been widely used for the first time for the us military during the 1990-91 desert storm campaign. however, this extended use has raised issues and controversies regarding safety, efficacy, and an unsatisfactory dosing regimen, as the vaccine requires 6-dose series of injections and annual boosters [85, 86] .therefore, identification of novel antigens is essential for the development of second-generation b. anthracis vaccines. orf products similar to proteins involved in bacterial pathogenesis, and secreted and surface exposed proteins are the focus of the research. using functional genomic analysis, 11 candidates were selected. in this case, a simple method that relied on the in vitro translation of the linear full-length dna of the selected orfs was used. polypeptides obtained in vitro were then evaluated for immunogenicity by analysis of their reactivity with hyperimmune anti-b. anthracis antisera. the combination of bioinformatic genomic analysis and an efficient and fast screening facilitated the identification of unknown antigenic proteins, three of which appear to be similar to immunogenic pa. these new proteins could represent parts of a second-generation anthrax vaccine [87] .old plague vaccines are based on killed whole cell preparations [86, 88] . although they appeared to be effective against endemic plague, they were not considered to be protective against respiratory plague, which is the form of most concern in case of biological attack. moreover, these vaccines have high rates of reactions, both systemic and local, especially with successive doses and suffer from short duration of protection, requiring biannual boosters. a live-attenuated vaccine (ev76 strain) also existed. while this vaccine seemed to be effective, it retained some virulence and in most countries it was considered not suitable for human use.in a search for novel attenuated vaccine candidates for use against y. pestis, a signature-tagged mutagenesis (stm) strategy was used [89] . a library of tagged mutants of the virulent y. pestis kimberley53 strain was generated. screening of 300 mutants through two consecutive cycles resulted in selection of 16 mutant strains. characterization of the phenotypes and genotypes of the selected mutants led to identification of virulence-associated genes coding for factors involved in global bacterial physiology (e.g., purh, purk, dnae, and grea) or for hypothetical polypeptides, as well as for the virulence regulator gene lcrf. one of the avirulent mutant strains was found to be disrupted in the pcm locus, which is presumably involved in the bacterial response to environmental stress. this kimberley53pcm mutant was superior to the ev76 live vaccine strain in an animal model in which mice were infected subcutaneously with the virulent y. pestis kimberley53 strain, either because the mutant induced 10-to 100-fold-higher antibody titers to the protective v and f1 antigens and because it conferred efficacious protective immunity. these results indicate that mutants with mutations in the pcm locus can serve as a platform for generation of a novel live vaccine with more promise for inducing efficacious protective immunity to virulent y. pestis strains than previously suggested mutants.the sars epidemic has been the first infectious disease outbreak to fully benefit from the revolutionary technologies of the post-genomic era. thanks to an unprecedented collaboration effort between scientists from many countries, coordinated by who and including clinical, epidemiological and laboratory investigations, within 15 days from the issue of the global alert, the causative agent of the new disease was discovered [90] . in less than a month after the initial identification of a new coronavirus (called sars-cov) as the infectious agent of sars, two independent genome sequences of the virus had been obtained [91, 92] . within three months, the genome sequences of 20 independent clinical isolates were made available in the genbank database. the rapid availability of the genomic sequence of the new virus has been very important from the public health perspective, giving prompt answers to a number of critical questions. it was clear that the agent was a natural (and not a laboratory-fabricated) coronavirus, diagnostic kits were set up, and possible drug and vaccine targets identified.today, some of these vaccines, based on a killed virus, are already being tested in pre-clinical and even in clinical trials, but their efficacy needs to be shown. moreover, in addition to the traditional approach, a number of newer strategies are being used. these include subunit vaccines containing recombinant spike protein expressed in mammalian cells or yeast, either alone or in combination with other sars-cov antigens. alternatively, these antigens could be delivered by dna immunization by non-replicating viruses, or viral vectors that are based on adenovirus, canarypox, modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) or alphavirus. in particular, the development of non-replicating coronavirus-like particles that mimic the structure of native virions could prove promising in the search for a successful vaccine as they display a large repertoire of antigenic sites and discontinuous epitopes [93] .it is crucial to remember that none of these approaches would have been possible in such a way and with such a speed without the knowledge of the complete genomic sequence of the virus. to make a comparison, the last time mankind faced the appearance of a new pandemic was in the early 1980s, with the appearance of hiv: at that time, only 20 years ago, it took two years to identify the etiologic agent of the infection, and a safe and effective vaccine is still lacking.when edward jenner gave birth to the concept of vaccination little could he know that after more than 200 years mankind would still be battling against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. however, contemporary society is lucky in that science is constantly offering more effective tools to combat and control infectious diseases. the question is whether the many social, political, cultural, and economic barriers that still exist vis-à-vis vaccines will be eventually overcome, thus recognizing the real value of vaccination. the first cases of an atypical pneumonia appeared in fosham, guangdong province, china in november 2002. by february 2003, over 700 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) were reported in the guangdong province of china. before it was contained by public health isolation and quarantine measures, the epidemic spread to 25 countries over 5 continents, and affected 8,422 people [1, 2] . sars infection causes respiratory disease and other organ systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, are also severely affected. the elderly and immunocompromised are more severely affected and suffer greater morbidity and mortality. by july 2003, 916 deaths had been attributed to the infection by this virus [2] . based on serologic data from samples collected prior to the outbreak and retrospectively analyzed, up to 40% of individuals working in the animal trade were seropositive but had no history of illness [3] , indicating that sars may be either extremely mild or asymptomatic in some cases. severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (sars-cov) is an enveloped rna virus and a member of the coronaviridae family that also includes other human pathogens which typically cause mild upper respiratory infections.coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense, single-stranded rna genome. sars-coronavirus (sars-cov) was unknown prior to the 2003 outbreak of disease and may be a mutant human coronavirus that acquired new virulence factors allowing for infection of the human population [4] . the genomic rna is encased in nucleocapsid (n) protein, which is surrounded by a lipid membrane containing the spike glycoprotein (s), membrane glycoprotein (m), and envelope (e) proteins. oligomers of the s glycoprotein form a characteristic spike that protrudes from the membrane [4, 5] . viral entry into host target cells appears to be mediated by sars-cov spike (s) glycoprotein and is dependent on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as the functional receptor [6] . in addition to being responsible for attachment to the cellular receptor, s contains epitopes for viral neutralization and t-cell responses [7] . studies performed by vrc investigators and colleagues have shown the importance of s-glycoprotein for coronavirus assembly and trafficking [8] . other studies have demonstrated neutralization of pseudovirions expressing this protein by serum from convalescent sars patients and the ability of the dna plasmid vaccine described here to induce protective immunity by eliciting cellular and humoral immunity to sars-cov in animal models, including the generation of neutralizing antibodies (nabs) measured in a plaque-reduction assay [8, 9] . studies performed in beijing, china with serum from patients with sars using a neutralization assay against a pseudotyped lentiviral vector bearing the s protein indicated that nabs were first detected 5-10 days after onset of symptoms, peaked at 20-30 days and were sustained for more than 150 days [10] .the nature of the spread and the severity of illness prompted widespread attempts to identify and understand the disease. the cause of sars was determined to be a novel coronavirus and the virus was fully sequenced by may 2003 [11, 12] . rapid identification and sequencing of the virus allowed scientists to begin developing candidate vaccines quickly. currently, there are no licensed human sars vaccines, and only one other vaccine clinical trial has been reported evaluating a whole-inactivated sars vaccine candidate developed by sinovac biotech co. ltd. in china [13] . the current report describes the results of a candidate sars dna vaccine evaluated in a phase i clinical trial in healthy adults initiated within 19 months after the sequence of the virus was initially published.the vrc 301 protocol was a phase i open-label study of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a sars recombinant plasmid dna vaccine encoding sars spike glycoprotein in healthy adult subjects. this single-site study was conducted at the vaccine research center (vrc), national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), national institutes of health (nih) in bethesda, maryland. experimental guidelines of the u.s. department of health and human services were followed in the conduct of clinical research, and the protocol was approved by the niaid institutional review board. ten subjects, ages 21-49, were enrolled in the study from december 13, 2004 through may 2, 2005. three injections of vaccine, at a dose of 4 mg each, were administered, on study days 0, 28, and 56 at a 4 mg dose in the lateral deltoid muscle via the biojector 2000 ® needle-free injection management system™. the dose and route studied in this trial were based on preclinical data and data from clinical trials of vrc dna vaccines for other pathogens [14] [15] [16] . subject safety was monitored by evaluating laboratory and clinical findings and adverse reactions at study visits and adverse events were coded with the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra). solicited symptoms of local and systemic reactogenicity, including pain, redness, swelling, myalgia, malaise, headache, chills, nausea and temperature, were collected by subject self report on 5-day diary cards following each vaccination. subjects were followed for a total of 32 weeks and study visits were completed in december 2005.the vaccine, vrc-srsdna015-00-vp, is composed of a single closed circular plasmid dna macromolecule (vrc-8318) that has been produced in bacterial cell cultures containing a kanamycin selection medium. bacterial cell growth is dependent upon the expression of the kanamycin resistance protein encoded by a portion of the plasmid dna. following growth of bacterial cells harboring the plasmid, the plasmid dna is purified and the vaccine does not contain cellular or viral components. the plasmid encodes for a single protein cloned into the expression vector cmv/r, that has been previously described [17] and evaluated in clinical trials for candidate hiv and ebola dna vaccines [14, 16] . the plasmid was constructed to produce a deletion mutant of the sars spike glycoprotein (urbani strain, genbank ay278741) with the cytoplasmic domain truncated (sδcd) [9] . the vrc-srsdna015-00-vp vaccine is based upon cdna expression of sars spike glycoprotein (urbani strain) with codon-modification to optimize expression in human cells. it expresses the full sequence except for deletion of the last 13 cooh-terminal amino acids. vaccine for the clinical trial was prepared under current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) conditions by vical, inc. (la jolla, ca). the vaccine met lot release specifications prior to administration. the dna vaccine was manufactured at a 4 mg/ml concentration in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs).vrc plasmid 8318 was expressed in 293 cells and purified for the major protein product. duplicate wells of serial dilutions of the volunteer sera were incubated for 2 hours at 37 ° c on sars spike antigen-coated / blocked plates, followed by biotin-conjugated antibody (60 minutes at room temperature), streptavidine-horseradish peroxidase (30 minutes at room temperature) and tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) substrate (10 minutes at room temperature). color development was stopped by addition of 0.9m sulfuric acid and plates were read within 30 minutes at 450 nm on the molecular devices spectramax 384-plus elisa plate reader (sunnyvale, ca). mean optical density (od) for each dilution was corrected for the mean od of the same dilution of the preimmunization sample. endpoint titers for each volunteer were established as the last dilution with a pre-immunization corrected od > 0.2.subject samples were assessed for the presence of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody by two assays. first, in a luciferase reporter pseudotyped lentiviral-based assay serial dilutions of sera were incubated with hiv-1 based luciferase reporter virus particles expressing sars spike glycoprotein that were produced in 293t cells as previously described [18] . target cells were human renal adenocarcinoma cell line 786-o obtained from atcc. the inhibitory concentration 80% (ic 80 ) is reported as a reciprocal dilution, and the analysis was performed using previously described methods [19] . secondly, two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum were assayed in quadruplicate wells of a 96-well plate using a starting dilution of 1:4. this microneutralization assay measured antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 tcid 50 of sars-cov in vero cell monolayers. the presence of viral cytopathic effect was read on days 3 and 4 and the dilution of serum that completely prevented cytopathic effect in 50% of the wells was calculated by the reed-muench formula [20] .elispot was performed on subject samples at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 32 as previously described [16] . cells were stimulated overnight with vaccine insert specific peptide pools at 2 × 10 5 cells per well. results are expressed as mean spot-forming cells (sfc) per million pbmc.cd4 and cd8 t-cell responses were measured by ics at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 32 as previously described [16] . cells were stimulated with vaccine insert specific peptide pools. cells were permeabilized, washed, and stained with directly conjugated anti-human cd3, cd4, cd8, ifn-γ and il-2 antibodies and were assessed for cd3, cd8, cd4, and ifnγ/il-2 expression on a facscalibur flow cytometer (bdis).all assays are treated as binary (responders/non-responders). we use the usual 95% central exact confidence intervals for binomial rates. we are 97.5% confident that the true response rates in the antibody assays are larger than the lower limit. calculations were done in r version 2.3.1. a positive t-cell response for ics and elispot data were based on composite criteria as previously described in four published studies of candidate vaccines [14] [15] [16] . sas (version 9.0; sas institute) and s-plus (version 6.2; insightful) were used for analyses.ten healthy adult subjects ages 21 to 49 years (mean age 35.5) were enrolled in the study. the subject population consisted of 70% male, predominantly white (90%) and non-hispanic/ latino (80%) subjects. the mean bmi was 24.6 (range 19.7 to 33.9). all subjects had an educational level of college or higher with 30% having an advanced degree. the demographic data regarding subject gender, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (bmi) and educational level at the time of enrollment is shown (table 1) .data collected from subject diary cards show that all 10 subjects (100%) experienced at least one mild injection site symptom following a vaccination (pain/tenderness, swelling, redness) with pain/tenderness at the injection site being the most common complaint. five of the ten (50%) subjects reported at least one mild systemic symptom (myalgia, malaise, headache, chills, or fever) following vaccination. among the solicited symptoms, none of the subjects reported nausea. none of the subjects reported moderate or severe symptoms following vaccination ( table 2 ).all subjects were followed for 32 weeks for safety and immune response. nine of 10 subjects completed the three dose vaccination schedule. one subject (subject "g") received an oral glucocorticoid to treat poison ivy contact dermatitis after the second vaccination and consequently was withdrawn from the vaccination schedule. there were no serious adverse events and there were no grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) adverse events. overall, study vaccinations were well-tolerated and found to be safe in healthy subjects, ages 21-49 years.sars spike glycoprotein specific antibody was detected by elisa in 8 of 10 (80%) of subjects at one or more timepoints (table 3) . neutralization was not detected in the microneutralization plaque-reduction assay. sars specific neutralizing antibody as assessed by pseudotyped lentiviral vector reporter neutralization assay was detected in 8 of 10 (80%) of subjects at one or more timepoints (figure 1 ). the neutralizing antibody response peaked between week 8 and 12 with 6 subjects remaining positive at week 32. pseudovirus neutralization assays are highly sensitive, and this is a possible reason for the discrepancy in the results between the two neutralization assays.sars spike glycoprotein specific, cd4+ and cd8+ t cell responses induced by the vaccine were assessed by ics and elispot. cd4+ t cell responses to sars cov spike antigen were detected by ics in all subjects (10/10) between week 2 and 32. cd8+ t cell responses were detected in 2 of 10 (20%) of subjects. cd4+ t cell responses were of greater frequency and magnitude than cd8+ responses (figure 2 ). cd4 and cd8+ t cell responses as assessed by elispot were detected in 7 of 10 (70%) of subjects during the course of the trial, and all 7 were positive by week 6 (2 weeks after the 2 nd dose of vaccine). the peak t cell response occurred between week 8 and 12 and when present, was sustained throughout the 32 week trial.sars represents a recently emergent infectious disease that has caused severe illness, global panic, and economic disruption. the rapid response to the 2003 sars outbreak defines the quintessential response by public health and biomedical communities for a newly emerging infectious disease. the ability to quickly identify, describe, characterize and develop countermeasures, including vaccines, against future emerging infectious pathogens is critical to maintain public health and economic stability. the global response to the sars epidemic provided insight and education for public health experts and scientists, which can now be utilized to more optimally respond to future emerging infections, including viruses such as avian influenza.in response to the 2003 sars infections, several laboratories rapidly developed vaccine candidates including the sars candidate dna vaccine described in this report. after preclinical evaluation for safety and demonstration of efficacy in a lethal murine challenge model [9] , a phase i human trial reported here was initiated within 17 months. similar candidate dna vaccines for hiv, ebola virus, and west nile virus (wnv) have previously been evaluated as safe and shown to elicit vaccine-induced cellular and humoral immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses to the wnv vaccine [21] . like the previously evaluated vrc dna vaccines, the sars vaccine induced vaccine-specific t cell and antibody responses, including neutralizing antibody against sars spike glycoprotein in a sensitive pseudotyped lentiviral reporter assay. in studies of sars patients, antibodies to sars cov spike, membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins are present as assessed by elisa, but neutralizing antibody is only elicited by the spike glycoprotein [22] [23] [24] .in this open-label phase i clinical trial, the vrc sars dna vaccine was evaluated as safe and well tolerated. the vaccine was immunogenic with sars spike glycoprotein-specific t cell responses induced in all subjects and neutralizing antibody responses detected in 8 of 10 subjects. sars spike protein-specific cellular responses were primarily cd4 + t cells, and a minority of subjects had detectable sars spike protein-specific cd8+ t cell responses. the cd8+ t cell response is an important effector mechanism for viral clearance and induction of this population is a goal for gene-based vaccines. in prior vrc clinical trials of dna vaccines against hiv, ebola, and west nile virus, vaccine-specific cd4 + t cell responses were detected in nearly all subjects, while the frequency of measurable cd8+ t cell responses varied from 7% to 64% [14] [15] [16] 21] . this aspect of dna vaccine-induced immunity will require additional development.an investigational inactivated sars vaccine candidate developed by sinovac biotech co. ltd. was found to be immunogenic in a phase 1 study conducted in china [13] . thirty-six healthy subjects received 2 doses of the inactivated sars-cov vaccine (either 16 or 32 sars-cov units) or placebo control, and all vaccine recipients seroconverted by day 42 post-vaccination. the geometric mean titer of nab (measured in a plaque-reduction format) peaked 2 weeks following the second immunization, and decreased after 4 weeks, similar to the kinetics observed in the sars dna vaccinated subjects described in this report. vaccine-induced cellular immune responses were not reported. studies of recovered sars patients have demonstrated long-lived effector/central memory t cell responses to sars s-protein [25] , as well as to the other sars viral proteins [26] [27] [28] , and cd8+ t cells are thought to play an important role in sars immunity [24] .these safety data and immune responses along with data from previously reported trials evaluating similar dna vaccines against other pathogens, including ebola, wnv and hiv, indicate that this sars dna vaccine should be further considered in expanded clinical evaluations for potential future sars outbreaks [14] [15] [16] 21] , alone or in prime-boost combination with other vectors. the sars dna vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies which are strongly associated with recovery from natural sars infection [13] as well as cellular immune responses that may be an important component of sars immunity. the neutralization activity was detected by a sensitive pseudotyped lentiviral assay, but not by a less sensitive microneutralization plaque-reduction assay. because the sars cov has been contained by careful surveillance and other public health measures, licensure of such a vaccine is likely to require use of the animal rule in models that reflect the pathogenesis in humans, and the identification and validation of immune correlates. this vaccine also demonstrates the feasibility of rapid manufacturing and regulatory review and provides additional safety and immunogenicity data to support the concept of dna vaccination as a potential vaccine platform for future emerging infectious diseases. magnitude and frequency of

by february 2003, over 700 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) were reported in the guangdong province of china. before it was contained by public health isolation and quarantine measures, the epidemic spread to 25 countries over 5 continents, and affected 8422 people [1, 2] .sars infection causes respiratory disease and other organ systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, are also severely affected. the elderly and immunocompromised are more severely affected and suffer greater morbidity and mortality. by july 2003, 916 deaths had been attributed to the infection by this virus [2] . based on serologic data from samples collected prior to the outbreak and retrospectively analyzed, up to 40% of individuals working in the animal trade were seropositive but had no history of illness [3] , indicating that sars may be either extremely mild or asymptomatic in some cases. severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (sars-cov) is an enveloped rna virus and a member of the coronaviridae family that also includes other human pathogens which typically cause mild upper respiratory infections.coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense, single-stranded rna genome. sars-coronavirus (sars-cov) was unknown prior to the 2003 outbreak of disease and may be a mutant human coronavirus that acquired new virulence factors allowing for infection of the human population [4] . the genomic rna is encased in nucleocapsid (n) protein, which is surrounded by a lipid membrane containing the spike glycoprotein (s), membrane glycoprotein (m), and envelope (e) proteins. oligomers of the s-glycoprotein form a characteristic spike that protrudes from the membrane [4, 5] . viral entry into host target cells appears to 0264 be mediated by sars-cov spike (s) glycoprotein and is dependent on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as the functional receptor [6] . in addition to being responsible for attachment to the cellular receptor, s contains epitopes for viral neutralization and t-cell responses [7] . studies performed by vrc investigators and colleagues have shown the importance of s-glycoprotein for coronavirus assembly and trafficking [8] . other studies have demonstrated neutralization of pseudovirions expressing this protein by serum from convalescent sars patients and the ability of the dna plasmid vaccine described here to induce protective immunity by eliciting cellular and humoral immunity to sars-cov in animal models, including the generation of neutralizing antibodies (nabs) measured in a plaque-reduction assay [8, 9] . studies performed in beijing, china with serum from patients with sars using a neutralization assay against a pseudotyped lentiviral vector bearing the s protein indicated that nabs were first detected 5-10 days after onset of symptoms, peaked at 20-30 days and were sustained for more than 150 days [10] .the nature of the spread and the severity of illness prompted widespread attempts to identify and understand the disease. the cause of sars was determined to be a novel coronavirus and the virus was fully sequenced by may 2003 [11, 12] . rapid identification and sequencing of the virus allowed scientists to begin developing candidate vaccines quickly. currently, there are no licensed human sars vaccines, and only one other vaccine clinical trial has been reported evaluating a whole-inactivated sars vaccine candidate developed by sinovac biotech co. ltd. in china [13] . the current report describes the results of a candidate sars dna vaccine evaluated in a phase i clinical trial in healthy adults initiated within 19 months after the sequence of the virus was initially published.the vrc 301 protocol was a phase i open-label study of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a sars recombinant plasmid dna vaccine encoding sars spike glycoprotein in healthy adult subjects. this single-site study was conducted at the vaccine research center (vrc), national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), national institutes of health (nih) in bethesda, maryland. experimental guidelines of the u.s. department of health and human services were followed in the conduct of clinical research, and the protocol was approved by the niaid institutional review board. ten subjects, ages 21-49, were enrolled in the study from december 13, 2004 through may 2, 2005. three injections of vaccine, at a dose of 4 mg each, were administered, on study days 0, 28, and 56 at a 4 mg dose in the lateral deltoid muscle via the biojector 2000 ® needle-free injection management system tm . the dose and route studied in this trial were based on preclinical data and data from clinical trials of vrc dna vaccines for other pathogens [14] [15] [16] . subject safety was monitored by evaluating laboratory and clinical findings and adverse reactions at study visits and adverse events were coded with the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra). solicited symptoms of local and systemic reactogenicity, including pain, redness, swelling, myalgia, malaise, headache, chills, nausea and temperature, were collected by subject self report on 5-day diary cards following each vaccination. subjects were followed for a total of 32 weeks and study visits were completed in december 2005.the vaccine, vrc-srsdna015-00-vp, is composed of a single closed circular plasmid dna macromolecule (vrc-8318) that has been produced in bacterial cell cultures containing a kanamycin selection medium. bacterial cell growth is dependent upon the expression of the kanamycin resistance protein encoded by a portion of the plasmid dna. following growth of bacterial cells harboring the plasmid, the plasmid dna is purified and the vaccine does not contain cellular or viral components. the plasmid encodes for a single protein cloned into the expression vector cmv/r, that has been previously described [17] and evaluated in clinical trials for candidate hiv and ebola dna vaccines [14, 16] . the plasmid was constructed to produce a deletion mutant of the sars spike glycoprotein (urbani strain, genbank ay278741) with the cytoplasmic domain truncated (s cd) [9] . the vrc-srsdna015-00-vp vaccine is based upon cdna expression of sars spike glycoprotein (urbani strain) with codon-modification to optimize expression in human cells. it expresses the full sequence except for deletion of the last 13 cooh-terminal amino acids. vaccine for the clinical trial was prepared under current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) conditions by vical, inc. (la jolla, ca). the vaccine met a lot of release specifications prior to administration. the dna vaccine was manufactured at a 4 mg/ml concentration in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs).vrc plasmid 8318 was expressed in 293 cells and purified for the major protein product. duplicate wells of serial dilutions of the volunteer sera were incubated for 2 h at 37 • c on sars spike antigen-coated/blocked plates, followed by biotin-conjugated antibody (60 min at room temperature), streptavidine-horseradish peroxidase (30 min at room temperature) and tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) substrate (10 min at room temperature). color development was stopped by addition of 0.9 m sulfuric acid and plates were read within 30 min at 450 nm on the molecular devices spectramax 384-plus elisa plate reader (sunnyvale, ca). mean optical density (od) for each dilution was corrected for the mean od of the same dilution of the pre-immunization sample. endpoint titers for each volunteer were established as the last dilution with a pre-immunization corrected od >0.2.subject samples were assessed for the presence of vaccineinduced neutralizing antibody by two assays. first, in a luciferase reporter pseudotyped lentiviral-based assay serial dilutions of sera were incubated with hiv-1 based luciferase reporter virus particles expressing sars spike glycoprotein that were produced in 293 t cells as previously described [18] . target cells were human renal adenocarcinoma cell line 786-o obtained from atcc. the inhibitory concentration 80% (ic 80 ) is reported as a reciprocal dilution, and the analysis was performed using previously described methods [19] . secondly, two-fold dilutions of heatinactivated serum were assayed in quadruplicate wells of a 96-well plate using a starting dilution of 1:4. this microneutralization assay measured antibodies that neutralized the infectivity of 100 tcid 50 of sars-cov in vero cell monolayers. the presence of viral cytopathic effect was read on days 3 and 4 and the dilution of serum that completely prevented cytopathic effect in 50% of the wells was calculated by the reed-muench formula [20] .elispot was performed on subject samples at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 32 as previously described [16] . cells were stimulated overnight with vaccine insert specific peptide pools at 2 × 10 5 cells per well. results are expressed as mean spot-forming cells (sfc) per million pbmc.cd4 and cd8 t-cell responses were measured by ics at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 32 as previously described [16] . cells were stimulated with vaccine insert specific peptide pools. cells were permeabilized, washed, and stained with directly conjugated anti-human cd3, cd4, cd8, ifn-␥ and il-2 antibodies and were assessed for cd3, cd8, cd4, and ifn-␥/il-2 expression on a facscalibur flow cytometer (bdis).all assays are treated as binary (responders/non-responders). we use the usual 95% central exact confidence intervals for binomial rates. we are 97.5% confident that the true response rates in the antibody assays are larger than the lower limit. calculations were done in r version 2.3.1. a positive t-cell response for ics and elispot data was based on composite criteria as previously described in four published studies of candidate vaccines [14] [15] [16] . sas (version 9.0; sas institute) and s-plus (version 6.2; insightful) were used for analyses.ten healthy adult subjects ages 21-49 years (mean age 35.5) were enrolled in the study. the subject population consisted of 70% male, predominantly white (90%) and non-hispanic/latino (80%) subjects. the mean bmi was 24.6 (range 19.7-33.9). all subjects had an educational level of college or higher with 30% having an advanced degree. the demographic data regarding subject gender, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index (bmi) and educational level at the time of enrollment are shown (table 1) .data collected from subject diary cards show that all 10 subjects (100%) experienced at least one mild injection site symptom fol- lowing a vaccination (pain/tenderness, swelling and redness) with pain/tenderness at the injection site being the most common complaint. five of the ten (50%) subjects reported at least one mild systemic symptom (myalgia, malaise, headache, chills, or fever) following vaccination. among the solicited symptoms, none of the subjects reported nausea. none of the subjects reported moderate or severe symptoms following vaccination ( table 2 ). all subjects were followed for 32 weeks for safety and immune response. nine of 10 subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule. one subject (subject "g") received an oral glucocorticoid to treat poison ivy contact dermatitis after the second vaccination maximum local (a.) and systemic (b.) reactogenicity. the local injection site reactions were recorded by clinicians at 30-45 min post-injection and were then recorded as self-assessments at home by subjects on a 5-day diary card. systemic reactions were recorded as self-assessments at home by subjects on a 5-day diary card following each injection. there were no reports of severe local symptoms following vaccination (a). there were no reports of severe systemic symptoms following vaccination (b). and consequently was withdrawn from the vaccination schedule. there were no serious adverse events and there were no grade 3 or 4 (severe or life-threatening) adverse events. overall, study vaccinations were well tolerated and found to be safe in healthy subjects, ages 21-49 years.sars spike glycoprotein specific antibody was detected by elisa in 8 of 10 (80%) of subjects at one or more timepoints (table 3) . neutralization was not detected in the microneutralization plaque- table 3 sars specific antibody titer assessed by elisa.week

assay. sars specific neutralizing antibody as assessed by pseudotyped lentiviral vector reporter neutralization assay was detected in 8 of 10 (80%) of subjects at one or more timepoints (fig. 1) . the neutralizing antibody response peaked between week 8 and 12 with 6 subjects remaining positive at week 32. pseudovirus neutralization assays are highly sensitive, and this is a possible reason for the discrepancy in the results between the two neutralization assays.sars spike glycoprotein specific, cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell responses induced by the vaccine were assessed by ics and elispot. cd4+ t-cell responses to sars cov spike antigen were detected by ics in all subjects (10/10) between week 2 and 32. cd8+ t-cell responses were detected in 2 of 10 (20%) of subjects. cd4+ t-cell responses were of greater frequency and magnitude than cd8+ responses (fig. 2) . cd4 and cd8+ t-cell responses as assessed by elispot were detected in 7 of 10 (70%) of subjects during the course of the trial, and all 7 were positive by week 6 (2 weeks after the 2nd dose of vaccine). the peak t-cell response occurred between week 8 and 12 and when present, was sustained throughout the 32-week trial.sars represents a recently emergent infectious disease that has caused severe illness, global panic, and economic disruption. the rapid response to the 2003 sars outbreak defines the quintessential response by public health and biomedical communities for a newly emerging infectious disease. the ability to quickly identify, describe, characterize and develop countermeasures, including vaccines, against future emerging infectious pathogens is critical to maintain public health and economic stability. the global response to the sars epidemic provided insight and education for public health experts and scientists, which can now be utilized to more optimally respond to future emerging infections, including viruses such as avian influenza.in response to the 2003 sars infections, several laboratories rapidly developed vaccine candidates including the sars candidate dna vaccine described in this report. after preclinical evaluation for safety and demonstration of efficacy in a lethal murine challenge model [9] , a phase i human trial reported here was initiated within 17 months. similar candidate dna vaccines for hiv, ebola virus, and west nile virus (wnv) have previously been evaluated as safe and shown to elicit vaccine-induced cellular and humoral immune responses, including neutralizing antibody responses to the wnv vaccine [21] . like the previously evaluated vrc dna vaccines, the sars vaccine induced vaccine-specific t-cell and antibody responses, including neutralizing antibody against sars spike glycoprotein in a sensitive pseudotyped lentiviral reporter assay. in studies of sars patients, antibodies to sars cov spike, membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid proteins are present as assessed by elisa, but neutralizing antibody is only elicited by the spike glycoprotein [22] [23] [24] .in this open-label phase i clinical trial, the vrc sars dna vaccine was evaluated as safe and well tolerated. the vaccine was immunogenic with sars spike glycoprotein-specific t-cell responses induced in all subjects and neutralizing antibody responses detected in 8 of 10 subjects. sars spike protein-specific cellular responses were primarily cd4+ t cells, and a minority of subjects had detectable sars spike protein-specific cd8+ t-cell responses. the cd8+ t-cell response is an important effector mechanism for viral clearance and induction of this population is a goal for gene-based vaccines. in prior vrc clinical trials of dna vaccines against hiv, ebola, and west nile virus, vaccine-specific cd4+ t-cell responses were detected in nearly all subjects, while the frequency of measurable cd8+ t-cell responses varied from 7% to 64% [14] [15] [16] 21] . this aspect of dna vaccine-induced immunity will require additional development.an investigational inactivated sars vaccine candidate developed by sinovac biotech co. ltd. was found to be immunogenic in a phase 1 study conducted in china [13] . thirty-six healthy subjects received 2 doses of the inactivated sars-cov vaccine (either 16 or 32 sars-cov units) or placebo control, and all vaccine recipients seroconverted by day 42 post-vaccination. the geometric mean titer of nab (measured in a plaque-reduction format) peaked 2 weeks following the second immunization, and decreased after 4 weeks, similar to the kinetics observed in the sars dna vaccinated subjects described in this report. vaccine-induced cellular immune responses were not reported. studies of recovered sars patients have demonstrated long-lived effector/central memory tcell responses to sars s-protein [25] , as well as to the other sars viral proteins [26] [27] [28] , and cd8+ t cells are thought to play an important role in sars immunity [24] .these safety data and immune responses along with data from previously reported trials evaluating similar dna vaccines against other pathogens, including ebola, wnv and hiv, indicate that this sars dna vaccine should be further considered in expanded clinical evaluations for potential future sars outbreaks [14] [15] [16] 21] , alone or in prime-boost combination with other vectors. the sars dna vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies which are strongly associated with recovery from natural sars infection [13] as well as cellular immune responses that may be an important component of sars immunity. the neutralization activity was detected by a sensitive pseudotyped lentiviral assay, but not by a less sensitive microneutralization plaque-reduction assay. because the sars cov has been contained by careful surveillance and other public health measures, licensure of such a vaccine is likely to require use of the animal rule in models that reflect the pathogenesis in humans, and the identification and validation of immune correlates. this vaccine also demonstrates the feasibility of rapid manufacturing and regulatory review and provides additional safety and immunogenicity data to support the concept of dna vaccination as a potential vaccine platform for future emerging infectious diseases.have killed millions of domestic fowl in southeast asia (tens of millions more have been culled). it has also infected >130 persons and killed >70 in vietnam, thailand, cambodia, indonesia, and china ( figure 1 ) (1). if the virus acquires the ability to transmit readily among humans, an influenza pandemic could ensue, with the potential to kill millions of people (2) . reports in both the popular press (3) and scientific literature (4) (5) (6) (7) have raised alarms in the united states and throughout the world. the prospect of pandemic influenza provides good reason to be concerned. rather than react in panic, however, we need to determine what can be done now with the knowledge and resources currently available to prevent or minimize the impact of a potential pandemic. at the same time we must ask how we can improve our infrastructure and technology to prepare for future outbreaks.unlike seasonal influenza epidemics caused by viruses that mutate in small but important ways from year to year, a process known as antigenic drift, pandemic influenza is caused by a virus that is dramatically different from those that have circulated previously, which can occur through a phenomenon referred to as antigenic shift (2) . such viruses can cause pandemics because few people, or none at all, have had prior immunologic exposure to surface proteins of these viruses. in a typical interpandemic influenza season, people may have some residual immunity from exposure to previously circulating influenza strains or from vaccinations (8) . for example, the predominant circulating influenza virus in the northern hemisphere during the 2004-2005 influenza season was an h3n2 virus that had drifted somewhat but was still fundamentally similar to the h3n2 viruses that had circulated in 2003-2004 and previously. nonetheless, a virus that has undergone antigenic drift can cause illness and death; vaccination provides varying degrees of protection from severe illness and death from influenza complications (8) . pandemic influenza, however, can cause a public health crisis because most people would be immunologically naive to the new virus. in addition, the pandemic virus might be inherently more virulent than interpandemic strains. whereas seasonal influenza rarely threatens the lives of young and otherwise healthy persons, pandemic influenza frequently has exacted a serious toll in healthy, young adults (2, 9) .as of december 2005, outbreaks of h5n1 avian influenza viruses had occurred in domestic poultry populations in at least 16 countries in asia and eastern europe (10) . h5n1 viruses have also have been isolated from wild birds. disease caused by h5n1 and presence of the virus among thousands of migratory wildfowl have been observed in western china, and more recently, in kazakhstan, mongolia, and croatia, which raises the possibility that h5n1 may be spreading from its stronghold in southeast asia through migratory flyways (11-13). in addition to a growing list of avian species, the virus has infected several mammalian species, including tigers, leopards, and pigs, and transmission among domestic cats has been observed in the laboratory (14) (15) (16) . together, these findings suggest that both the geographic and host ranges of h5n1 viruses are expanding.the true extent of human h5n1 infections is not precisely known; preliminary reports suggest that the extent of bird-to-human transmission may be more widespread than originally thought (17) . thus far, the virus has not acquired the ability to be efficiently transmitted from human to human, although a recent report describes the possible transmission of h5n1 within a family in thailand (18) .the h5n1 avian influenza viruses now circulating may be the most likely candidates for triggering an influenza pandemic because of ongoing reports of new cases in humans (19) . however, other avian influenza viruses also are being monitored for their potential to infect and cause disease in humans ( figure 2 ). the h9n2 influenza virus, although not highly pathogenic, has circulated widely among birds in hong kong and china; it infected 2 children in 1999 (20,21) and 1 child in hong kong in 2003 (22) , each of whom recovered. five additional human infections with h9n2 viruses were reported in the chinese literature (23) . another avian influenza virus, h7n7, is worrisome because it is highly pathogenic in birds and appears to be more readily transmissible from human to human (24, 25) . during a large outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in europe in 2003, an h7n7 virus was detected in at least 86 poultry workers and 3 family members who had no contact with chickens; these persons were treated for conjunctivitis, influenzalike symptoms, or both. a veterinarian who handled infected chickens died of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress (24, 25) . with the exception of this fatal case, the h7n7 virus appeared to be relatively benign for humans. recent reports indicate that an h7 influenza a virus may be circulating among chickens in north korea (26) . if a virus such as h5n1 (which is highly pathogenic in humans) were to acquire the genetic capability that enabled the efficient transmissibility observed with h7n7 or human h1n1 or h3n2 influenza viruses, while maintaining most or all of its pathogenic potential, a deadly pandemic could ensue.predicting or preventing the natural events that could facilitate efficient transmission of a pandemic influenza virus among humans is difficult. however, we must be prepared to react quickly and decisively should such an event occur. critical to the containment of a potential influenza pandemic is diligent surveillance for novel viruses in both human and animal populations using appropriate diagnostics; we must also monitor the viruses for changes that could signal increased virulence or transmissibility. equally important are the development and production of effective countermeasures, such as vaccines and antiviral drugs (27). vaccine development is a critical component of pandemic influenza preparedness. in this regard, the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) at the national institutes of health (nih) in april 2005 initiated a phase i clinical trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of different doses of an inactivated h5n1 influenza vaccine manufactured by sanofi pasteur (28). in this study, 451 healthy adult volunteers were vaccinated at 3 sites in the united states. preliminary evaluation indicates the vaccine is safe and able to stimulate an immune response that may be protective. the vaccine is currently being tested in the elderly, and testing in children is expected to begin by january 2006.the h5n1 seed virus used to make this vaccine was developed in a matter of weeks through the use of reverse genetics, whereas the traditional process of genetic reassortment usually requires a longer period of time and is less predictable (29) . additional pilot lots of inactivated vaccine are being produced by another manufacturer, chiron corporation, and are expected to undergo testing by early 2006.chiron also has produced 40,000 doses of an inactivated h9n2 influenza vaccine formulated with and without mf59 adjuvant. clinical trials to test the safety and immunogenicity of the inactivated h9n2 vaccine are underway, with promising preliminary results. in addition, the us department of health and human services (hhs) has awarded several contracts to pharmaceutical companies to produce large quantities of bulk h5n1 vaccine as part of the hhs pandemic influenza preparedness program. these contracts are a critical step toward pandemic influenza preparedness because they pave the way for the manufacturer to commence efficient, large-scale production of any pandemic vaccine if or when it is needed. hhs has also awarded a separate contract to sanofi pasteur to accelerate the development of cell culturebased technologies for influenza vaccine production (28).in addition, the intramural research program of niaid has generated live, attenuated, cold-adapted h9n2 and h5n1 vaccine candidates that have proven protective in mice. the h9n2 vaccine candidate has been tested in a phase i clinical trial, and data are currently being evaluated; clinical evaluation of the h5n1 vaccine is planned for the spring of 2006. live, attenuated vaccines are especially promising because they generally trigger more rapid and robust immune responses compared with those induced by inactivated vaccines. live, attenuated vaccines may also offer more cross-reactivity and therefore greater protection against different variants of the same virus (30) .the concept of extending vaccine supplies also is being pursued. research has suggested that delivering vaccines intradermally might allow successful immunization with less antigen (31) (32) (33) ; clinical trials to compare intramuscular versus intradermal delivery of h5n1 vaccines began in 2005. preliminary safety data showed no adverse effects and immunogenicity data are expected soon. studies to assess the effect of alum and mf59 adjuvants on inactivated h5n1 vaccine safety and immunogenicity also are anticipated.other research efforts are focused on medications to treat influenza infection. unfortunately, most currently circulating h5n1 influenza viruses are resistant to 2 inexpensive antiinfluenza drugs, rimantadine and amantadine, that target the viral m2 protein. newer drugs such as oseltamivir phosphate and zanamivir that target the influenza neuraminidase protein appear to be effective against most current h5n1 strains (34) . hhs and the centers for disease control and prevention have begun developing a stockpile of antiinfluenza drugs that includes oseltamivir phosphate, zanamivir, and rimantadine for future use should pandemic influenza occur. numerous other projects are under way to identify novel drug targets and develop compounds that inhibit viral entry, replication, and maturation (28).underpinning these efforts are basic research studies. for example, niaid coordinates the influenza genome sequencing project, a collaborative effort to create complete genetic blueprints of known human and avian influenza viruses. as of december 7, 2005, a total of 559 influenza genome sequences have been made publicly available in genbank by the niaid project (35) . in a separate but related contract awarded to researchers at st. jude children's research hospital, animal influenza viruses from wild birds, live bird markets, and pigs in hong kong and north america are being sequenced, and surveillance has expanded to include additional sites in asia. the goal of these projects is to rapidly sequence influenza genomes derived from a variety of human and animal sources to enable scientists to understand how the viruses evolve, spread, and cause disease. the long-term goal is improving methods of prevention and treatment.as we develop strategies to prepare for an influenza pandemic, we need to address the overall fragility of the entire vaccine research and manufacturing enterprise (27, 36, 37) . many pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to enter or remain in the business of manufacturing vaccines. unpredictable consumer demands and lack of financial incentives make vaccine manufacturing a risky business in today's marketplace. this situation is particularly true with influenza vaccine. strong collaborations among government, academia, and industry are needed to ensure a reliable vaccine supply. the biomedical research community can help by developing state-of-the-art technologies and sharing them with industry to streamline the manufacturing process and make it more flexible, predictable, and able to adapt to the evolving nature of influenza viruses and other pathogens. financial and economic incentives, including fair pricing and guaranteed purchase of unsold supplies, regulatory relief, tax incentives, liability protection, and intellectual property considerations, are needed to ensure a steady supply of vaccines (27, 36, 37) . although the fragility of the vaccine industry cannot be fixed overnight, the process needs to be initiated now to adequately prepare for future pandemics.recent experience with an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) serves as an instructive example in preparing for a potential influenza pandemic (38, 39) . in 2002, the deadly respiratory disease emerged and rapidly spread to canada, vietnam, hong kong, and other sites in china, ultimately resulting in 8,098 cases and 774 deaths. the outbreak, which elicited a classic study in epidemiologic investigation with regard to identifying the point source, tracking the spread, and instituting containment measures, taught us many important lessons. academic scientists, public health officials, and commercial pharmaceutical companies acted together in an unprecedented way, leading to the development of promising vaccine candidates in record time. the etiologic agent of sars, a previously unrecognized coronavirus, was identified in march 2003 and sequenced within 2 weeks, and a vaccine candidate was developed by the following march. in december 2004, a clinical trial of a candidate sars vaccine began at the nih vaccine research center (40) .because the sars coronavirus is not as easily transmitted as influenza viruses, we do not know whether the actions that led to the containment of sars would be as successful if an avian influenza virus acquired the ability to spread efficiently from person to person. however, we have an added advantage in bracing for pandemic influenza that we did not have with sars. as noted, sars is caused by a coronavirus that was unknown before the 2003 outbreak. in the current situation, we have identified the h5n1 virus as a likely candidate for triggering a pandemic.we cannot be certain when the next influenza pandemic will emerge, or even whether it will be caused by h5n1 or an unrelated virus. however, we can be certain that an influenza pandemic eventually will occur. the efforts currently under way to monitor the evolution and spread of h5n1 and other influenza viruses and to develop candidate vaccines and appropriate countermeasures will help in developing the infrastructure and manufacturing capacity that will be required to scale up vaccine and antiviral production when the pandemic occurs.because quantities of vaccine and antiviral drugs against a pandemic influenza virus will be limited, deciding beforehand how to best use our resources throughout the world to minimize the impact of pandemic influenza is critical. global cooperation will be vital. during the sars epidemic, the world health organization created an outstanding network of laboratories and public health agencies from countries around the globe that were indispensable in identifying and ultimately containing the spread of the virus. to adequately address the many research issues surrounding avian influenza and other potential pandemic pathogens, niaid's office of clinical research is establishing a southeast asia clinical trials network to evaluate influenza interventions. this network builds upon existing infrastructure where possible and will be a true partnership between the investigators and the healthcare leadership of the target countries. such international teamwork is essential as we prepare for an influenza pandemic.the rapid emergence of a highly pathogenic, readily transmissible coronavirus has resulted in a global pandemic, affecting millions and destabilizing economies. this catastrophe triggered a clarion call for the immediate deployment of a protective vaccine. we describe the unique challenges of developing a vaccine against sars-cov-2 in a pandemic setting.historically, human coronaviruses have received limited attention from the research and medical communities. although infections by human coronaviruses (e.g., hcov-229e and hcov-oc43) frequently cause common cold symptoms in healthy individuals, severe clinical illness is relatively rare even in immunocompromised individuals, infants, and the elderly. considerably more has been known about animal coronaviruses, leading to vaccines to prevent the infection of commercially important domesticated animals (e.g., cats, dogs, and cattle). experiments over many years with murine hepatitis virus (mhv), a neurotropic and hepatotropic coronavirus, have provided substantial insight into the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis and central nervous diseases, including multiple sclerosis. while these studies enhanced our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses, only the recent explosive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans has sparked intense interest in developing countermeasures for human viruses in this family.in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) virus emerged from bats and possibly civet cats in china. within eight months, sars-cov spread to 27 countries around the world, resulting in 8,096 human infections and 774 deaths (de wit et al., 2016 ). an unprecedented level of containment, made possible by extensive collaboration among international public health organi-zations, limited transmission and human disease. ten years later, a second coronavirus, the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), was isolated from an individual suffering from severe respiratory disease and renal failure. as observed with sars-cov, mers-cov spread via travel and contact with infected individuals, resulting in transmission and mortality within and beyond the arabian peninsula (2,494 human cases, 858 deaths). serological studies identified dromedary camels as the principal reservoir for mers-cov. since the discovery of sars-cov, two additional human coronaviruses that cause lower respiratory tract infections (hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1) have been discovered. sequencing studies of bat reservoirs identified a large number of novel coronaviruses with an unknown potential to emerge in humans (graham et al., 2013) .an appreciation of the considerable threat of coronaviruses to global health prompted remarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of sars-cov and mers-cov as well as efforts to develop vaccines. in this forum, we discuss how the prior study of sars-cov and mers-cov enabled the extraordinarily rapid development of candidate vaccines that hopefully can curtail the incendiary spread of a novel, highly pathogenic zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). however, this unprecedented pace has eclipsed some of the funda-mental basic and translational studies that customarily guide vaccine development and evaluation under non-pandemic circumstances. accordingly, we discuss the challenges of rapid vaccine development during a pandemic response.the sars-cov-2 pandemic sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense singlestranded rna virus first isolated in wuhan, china, in december of 2019 from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases (zhou et al., 2020) . sars-cov-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome, coronavirus-induced disease-19 (covid-19), which is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation (guan et al., 2020) . the elderly, immunocompromised, and those with co-morbid metabolic, pulmonary, and cardiac conditions are at a markedly greater risk of death from covid-19. virtually all countries and territories have been affected, with major epidemics in china, italy, spain, germany, france, iran, and the united states and epicenters in large urban cities. most cases are spread by direct human-to-human and droplet contact, with a contribution from transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. sars-cov-2 has caused a global pandemic with more than 2,400,000 infections to date, 165,000 deaths (as of 19 april 2020), and a case-fatality rate estimated at 4%. the extensive morbidity, mortality, and destabilizing social and economic consequences highlight the critical need for the accelerated development of countermeasures. rapid implementation and deployment of an effective sars-cov-2 vaccine has the potential to lessen the deleterious effects of infection, especially in vulnerable populations, curb transmission, end the pandemic, and prevent its return.coronaviruses are round, 120-nm-diameter virus particles that derive their name from the incorporation of the viral spike (s) protein in an arrangement that resembles a crown on the virion surface. three the m and e proteins function during virion morphogenesis, and their expression is sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles, although their value as immunogens may be limited because they lack the s protein thought to be an important target for neutralizing antibodies. interactions between the m glycoprotein and the other three structural proteins coordinate virion assembly. the small structural e protein has multiple functions including stimulating the membrane curvature required for virion budding and promoting lipid membrane scission of virions once formed. the nucleocapsid protein binds to the viral genome and facilitates its incorporation into the virus particle.the s protein exists on virions as homotrimeric spikes that promote coronavirus entry into cells via attachment and membrane fusion (de wit et al., 2016) . in some circumstances, the s protein also promotes the formation of syncytia enabling direct cell-to-cell transfer of the viral genome. the s protein is a class i viral fusion protein related functionally to the entry-fusion proteins of other wellcharacterized viruses including influenza (hemagglutinin [ha], hiv-1 [gp160], and ebola [glycoprotein, gp] ). this class of viral fusion proteins characteristically regulates fusogenic activity by proteolytic cleavage. accordingly, the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s proteins are cleaved sequentially during the entry process to yield s1 and s2 fragments, followed by further processing of s2 to yield a smaller s2 0 protein. cleavage also may occur during viral egress. the s1 fragment includes the receptor binding domain (rbd), whereas the carboxyl terminal s2 portion of the molecule contains regions that drive membrane fusion. the structure of a soluble, stabilized prefusion form of the sars-cov-2 s protein was solved to a resolution of 3.5å using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing considerable similarity to the sars-cov s protein ( figure 1b ; wrapp et al., 2020) . both vi-ruses utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as a cellular receptor, consistent with the high conservation of the rbd.the application of strategies that have worked for related viral family members provides a path for rapid vaccine development against a newly emerging virus. for example, several of the antigen targets, vaccine platforms, and clinical trial approaches used for zika virus (zikv) after its emergence in 2015 were based on prior studies and successes with related flaviviruses. several vaccine strategies against sars-cov and mers-cov, many focused on the s protein, have been developed and tested extensively in pre-clinical models (zhou et al., 2018 within months of publication of the sars-cov-2 genome sequence, work began on dozens of vaccine candidates (https://www.who.int/blueprint/prioritydiseases/key-action/novel-coronaviruslandscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1), enabled by insights from the sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine development and well-characterized vaccine antigen expression platforms, including those shown to be safe in humans. several vaccines, described below, have entered phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate safety in small numbers of subjects (table 1) . however, given the lack of established and tractable pre-clinical disease models of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis, these vaccines have advanced to human trials without data in animals establishing efficacy against covid-19. mrna-1273 modified mrnas are synthetic molecules optimized for high-level and durable protein expression. this technology has shown promise as a vaccine platform for influenza virus (nct03076385 and nct03345043) and in preclinical studies with other infectious disease targets including zikv. developed by the national institute of allergy and infectious . these studies identified stabilizing proline substitutions in the central helix of s2 that reduced the fusion activity and allowed high-level expression of trimeric s in an antigenically native prefusion context. the structure of the stabilized sars-cov-2 antigen encoded by mrna-1273 has been solved ( figure 1b) . a phase 1 clinical trial of mrna-1273 (nct04283461) was initiated in march of 2020 as an open-label, doseranging study in 45 subjects who were administered the vaccine in two doses 29 days apart. subjects will be followed for 12 months following the second dose for safety, with immunogenicity as a secondary objective.ino-4800 is a dna plasmid vaccine candidate encoding the sars-cov-2 s protein being developed by inovio pharmaceuticals. a similar approach was evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials as a vaccine for mers-cov and was shown to be immunogenic (gls-5300; nct02670187). three doses of gls-5300 elicited s-protein-binding antibodies in a majority (94%) of vaccinated individuals, although neutralizing anti-bodies were observed less frequently (50% of subjects) and titers waned substantially during the course of study follow-up (modjarrad et al., 2019) . vaccine-elicited, mers-cov-specific t cell responses also were detectable in most recipients. these experiences informed the sars-cov-2 vaccine candidate ino-4800, which is now being evaluated in an open-label phase 1 clinical trial. volunteers will receive two doses of dna administered intradermally by electroporation 28 days apart. adenovirus vectors adenovirus (ad) vectors, derived from multiple species, have been employed to deliver vaccine antigens for multiple infectious disease targets. multiple advectored sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines have been characterized in preclinical models. these vaccines elicited both humoral and cellular coronavirus-reactive responses and protected against infection. a simian ad vector expressing the mers-cov s protein is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (nct04170829). a phase 1/2 study to explore the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a sars-cov-2 vaccine using this platform has been initiated by investigators at the university of oxford (nct04324606). a similar approach using the human ad5 serotype is being tested by beijing institute of biotechnology and cansino biologics inc. (nct04313127).multiple clinical studies are underway to explore the use of bacille calmette-gue-rin (bcg) as an immunomodulatory vaccine to protect against covid-19 disease (table 1) . bcg is a live-attenuated isolate of mycobacterium bovis delivered as a low-cost vaccine to more than 100 million children each year to protect against mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb). multiple studies in humans and mice suggest bcg administration confers a non-specific protective effect against viral infections (moorlag et al., 2019) . the mechanisms of bcg-mediated cross protections may include enhanced th1 and th17 responses to heterologous antigens and the induction of non-specific memory or ''trained immunity'' in innate immune cells capable of producing inflammatory cytokines when challenged secondarily by virus infection.despite the expedited design of vaccine candidates against a newly emerging virus in a pandemic setting, there remain substantive challenges for implementation due, in part, to a need to concurrently unravel fundamental aspects of virus biology and immunity along with product development efforts. this approach contrasts with vaccine efforts against viruses that have been studied for many years (e.g., influenza, dengue [denv] , and respiratory syncytial viruses) for which we understand in great detail both the antigenicity of the viral structural proteins and the nature of protective and potentially pathological immune responses. while multiple vaccine platforms against sars-cov-2 focus on the s protein, questions remain regarding the key elements of a protective immune response.(1) will neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection? do protective responses require antibody targeting of specific epitopes? is there a threshold neutralizing antibody response that protects against sars-cov-2? (2) do some of the assays commonly used in vitro to measure neutralization (e.g., pseudotyped viruses) faithfully predict protective activity in vivo?(3) what is the role of non-neutralizing anti-s antibodies that bind the surface of infected cells? could non-neutralizing antibodies promote effector-function-mediated virus clearance via fc-g-receptor interactions? (4) what is the contribution of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract for protection against infection or dissemination? (5) are humoral responses to other viral open reading frames (orfs) important for immunity, especially those with immune antagonist activity that are displayed on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly? and (6) how important are cd4 + and cd8 + t cell responses to vaccine-mediated protection? while some of this information can be gleaned from pre-clinical and early vaccine trials with sars-cov and mers-cov, how certain are we that these correlates of protection will transfer to the pandemic sars-cov-2?the emergence and rapid spread of sars-cov-2 has provided a very short window to address knowledge gaps about coronavirus immunity. indeed, a major challenge has been the absence of high-throughput small animal disease models to facilitate vaccine candidate down-selection and the detailed study of protective immunity. pre-print manuscripts indicate that conventional laboratory strains of mice are not susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection (https://doi. org/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389), likely because mouse ace2 cannot act as a cellular receptor for sars-cov-2 (letko et al., 2020) . transgenic mice that express human ace2 (hace2-tg) develop pneumonia after infection; however, these mice are not yet widely available for vaccine testing. beyond this, pathogenesis and immune response evaluation studies in different non-human primate species or other possible animal models (e.g., ferrets and hamsters) still are in early stages of development.safety is the primary consideration of any vaccine development program, given the anticipated administration to large numbers of people. beyond the expected reactogenicity profiles, studies with other distantly and closely related coronaviruses have raised concerns that humoral vaccine responses might potentiate sars-cov-2 infection via immune enhancement mechanisms. immune enhancement might occur via at least two distinct mechanisms, detailed below. antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of infection describes a phenomenon in which poorly neutralizing antibodies bind viruses and increase attachment, internalization, and infection of myeloid cells expressing fc-g or complement receptors. ade of denv infection contributes to severe clinical disease in a small fraction of individuals infected for a second time by a heterologous serotype of denv or in newborns that have subneutralizing levels of maternal denv-immune igg. ade is an obstacle for denvvaccine development, as illustrated by adverse events experienced by denvnaive children that received the licensed tetravalent vaccine dengvaxia. through a possibly similar, yet undefined, mechanism, immunization of cats with a vaccinia virus-vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus s protein vaccine resulted in greater rates of death upon challenge of cats with this animal coronavirus (vennema et al., 1990) . in cell culture experiments, sars-cov entry and infection were enhanced by some anti-s antibodies through both fc-g-receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms (jaume et al., 2011; wan et al., 2020) . extensive studies with flaviviruses revealed that ade assays in cell culture do not correlate directly with in vivo outcomes, as enhancement can be demonstrated in vitro for many viruses for which there is no immune-enhanced disease in vivo. this may be explained by the very reductionist format of traditional ade assays that do not integrate features of the immune response known to contribute to immunity. the inclusion of complement at physiological concentrations, which is omitted from many in vitro assays, reduces enhancement in an igg subclass-dependent manner. ade has been demonstrated using immunodeficient murine models of denv infection following passive transfer of immune sera, but disease severity is reduced considerably in the presence of antiviral t cells. coronavirus antibodies that enhance in vitro have not been tested for their ability to exacerbate infection and disease in animals. is the infection of fcg-receptor-expressing myeloid cells, which might be augmented by antibodies, an important contributor to covid-19 disease severity? studies to address these concepts await the development of appropriate disease models. for denv, the most compelling evidence for a role of ade in pathogenesis comes from epidemiological studies in humans.a second potential mechanism for vaccine-induced disease enhancement results from skewing of the cellular immune response. enhanced respiratory disease was observed in the 1960s in some recipients of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) vaccine. enhanced disease was characterized by lung infiltration by mononuclear cells, including eosinophils, along with a th2-directed t cell response (ruckwardt et al., 2019) . immune complex deposition after the induction of binding, but not neutralizing, antibodies has been proposed as an explanation for this response. while preclinical studies of multiple sars-cov vaccine candidates demonstrated significant protection from infection, a similar th2-driven immunopathogenic response was observed in some instances (bolles et al., 2011) . the structure of the immunogen, vaccine formulation including the adjuvant, and age of vaccine recipient may influence the immune response and subsequent outcome of natural infection, although this remains unclear. based on recent progress in rsv vaccine development, eliciting a neutralizing antibody response focused on the most protective prefusion s epitopes together with a th1 t cell response may be key features of a safe sars-cov-2 vaccine.the development of an effective viral vaccine is a challenge typically guided by decades of basic research on viral biology and the host response to infection. this traditional path is not feasible for a rapidly emerging, highly virulent pathogen like sars-cov-2 for which a dire need for a vaccine exists. although behavioral changes may stem the spread of infections, vaccination likely will be required to prevent the establishment of seasonal (or additional) waves of infection and disease. against the backdrop of the many unknowns about coronavirus immunity, there is some risk associated with expedited vaccine development during a pandemic. however, this uncertainty must be balanced by the enormous cost of inaction. studies of other pathogenic coronaviruses have enabled the rapid design of candidate sars-cov-2 vaccines, provided insight into aspects of immunity that may be important for protection, and identified features that merit attention with respect to vaccine safety. in this setting, carefully designed clinical trials in humans that establish and monitor safety and define correlates and durability of protection, may not only result in an effective countermeasure that curtails the pandemic but also provide key mechanistic answers into immune control of sars-cov-2 infection and possibly related highly pathogenic coronaviruses that could emerge in the future.this work was supported by the intramural program of the niaid (tcp), nih contracts and grants (75n93019c00062 and r01 ai127828), and the defense advanced

medicine has received sponsored research agreements from moderna.coronaviruses are crown-like particles with spikes protruding from their surface. they are enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense rna (+ssrna) genomes of approximately 26-32 kb, which is currently the largest known genome size for an rna virus. 1 rna viruses are divided into five branches. 2, 3 certain groups in a particular branch might be related to and/or share features with viruses classified in another branch. in branch 1 are the leviviruses and eukaryotic relatives (e.g., mitoviruses, narnaviruses, ourmiaviruses); branch 2 represents several +rna virus families (of eukaryotes) (e.g., orders picornavirales and nidovirales, and the families caliciviridae, potyviridae, astroviridae, and solemoviridae) and several dsrna viruses (e.g., partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses); in branch 3 are certain +rna viruses such as the supergroups of alphaviruses and offlaviviruses, the nodaviruses, tombusviruses, and many small and novel groups; in branch 4 are dsrna viruses such as the cystoviruses, reoviruses, and totiviruses; branch 5 consists of −rna viruses. 2 coronaviruses were classified as most likely related to branch 2, and belong to the order nidovirales, and the family coronaviridae. in 2018, the international committee on taxonomy of viruses divided the coronaviridae into the orthocoronavirinae and letovirinae subfamilies.according to their host targets, coronaviruses can also be divided into animal and human coronaviruses. many diseases in domestic animals are related to animal coronaviruses, such as canine respiratory coronavirus, which causes respiratory disease in dogs. 4 the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses belong to the subfamily coronavirinae from the family coronaviridae. the viruses in this subfamily group into four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus. the classic subgroup clusters are labeled 1a-1b for the alphacoronaviruses and 2a-2d for the betacoronaviruses. to date, including the recently discovered sars-cov-2, there are seven coronaviruses that infect humans. human coronavirus (hcov)-229e, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, or hcov-hku1 cause only the common cold, 5 whereas the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) or the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) cause relatively high mortality and emerged in 2002 6 and 2012, 7 respectively. notably, sars-cov-2 is currently causing a worldwide epidemic. sars-cov and mers-cov belong to subgroups 2b and 2c of the betacoronaviruses, respectively, 1, 8 whereas sars-cov-2 is a new member of the betacoronaviruses distinct from sars-cov and mers-cov. 9 figure 1 shows the phylogenetic tree of rna viruses.the estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses (covs) are moderate to high compared to those of other ssrna viruses. 1 there are two gene loci that are sites of variation in sars-cov. one of these sites is located in the spike (s) protein gene. the second major site of variation is the accessory gene open reading frame orf8. in mers-cov, the major sites of variation are located in the s, orf4b, and orf3 genes. 2 the major differences in the sequence of the s gene of sars-cov-2 are three short insertions in the n-terminal domain and changes in four out of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif. 9 the organizations of the genome and gene expression are similar for all coronaviruses. orf1a/b, located at the 5′ end, encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) (named nsp1-nsp16); other orfs at the 3′ end encode structural proteins, including the s, envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) proteins.the mutations in sars-cov-2 have become a hot research topic. the surface proteins of sars-cov and batcov-ratg13, the nearest potential bat precursors of sars-cov-2, have 76 and 97% sequence identity, respectively, to that of sars-cov-2. 10 compared to that of sars-cov, the antigenic surface of sars-cov-2 is highly divergent compared to other covs. since its outbreak began at the end of 2019, sars-cov-2 has acquired mutations throughout its genome, and there are already hundreds of virus strains distributed worldwide. according to gisaid.org, as of may 8, there were 16,004 full genome sequences available, and the s clade of the full genome tree contains the largest group of viruses, indicating that mutations in orf8-l84s are most frequent. the temporal resolution assumes an average nucleotide substitution rate of 5 × 10 −4 substitutions per site per year. based on these mutations, researchers found that sars-cov-2 can be divided into two subtypes. they reported that the snps at locations 8782 and 28,144 show strong linkage; the "ct" haplotype was defined as the "l" type because t28,144 encodes leucine, while the "tc" haplotype was defined as the "s" type because c28,144 encodes serine, 11 which is in accordance with another study that divided sars-cov-2 into two types. 12 the "l" type seems to be more prevalent and aggressive, but the "s" type may be ancestral, as sites 8782 and 28,144 were identical to the orthologous sites in the most closely related viruses. 13 patients may be infected by either or both types. 11 from the gisaid update, compared with ratg13, there are differences in the receptor-binding interface, which may have favored host switching. data related to the sequence and mutations of sars-cov-2 are also available and continuously updated online through the china national center for bioinformation (cncb) (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov).the history of sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 the first case of sars was discovered in foshan, china, in november 2002. 6 infections occurred through either direct or indirect contact with patients. by july 2003, sars-cov had spread to over 30 countries, 12 causing 8096 reported cases and 774 deaths. after that, no additional infections were detected, and the sars pandemic was declared over. sars-cov was first isolated from himalayan palm civets (hpcs) from a live-animal market in guangdong, china. 12, 14 other animals, such as raccoon dogs (nyctereutes procyonoides), along with human workers from the same market, also showed evidence of viral infection. 12 multiple studies have demonstrated that the reservoirs of several coronaviruses, including sars-cov-like and mers-cov-like viruses, were bats. 8, 15 although palm civets might have been intermediary hosts of sars-cov, 16 researchers often concluded there was no evidence that these animals were the ultimate sources of sars-cov, and the viruses cannot circulate directly in palm civets in the wild. 17 in 2003, guan and zheng's team investigated a live-animal retail market in guangdong, focusing on recently captured wild animals and human consumption. the animals sampled included seven wild and one domestic animal species. they collected nasal fig. 1 phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses based on full-length genome sequences. all complete genome sequences of coronavirus were downloaded from the ncbi reference sequence database, refseq. the tree was constructed using maximum likelihood estimation (mle) by mega x, with clustal omega as the multiple sequence alignment method, and 1000 bootstrap replicates. only bootstraps ≥50% values are shown. the seven known human-infecting coronaviruses are indicated with a red star and fecal samples with swabs and then used reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) to test for viral nucleic acid from the n gene of the human sars-cov. the rt-pcr assay results showed that samples from four of six hpcs were positive; the other seven species (beaver, chinese ferret-badger, chinese hare, chinese muntjac, domestic cat, hog-badger, and raccoon dog) sampled were negative. 12 mers-cov was first found in 2012 in a lung sample from a 60year-old patient who died of respiratory failure in jeddah, saudi arabia. on 15 september 2012, a similar type of virus named human coronavirus was isolated from a patient with severe respiratory infection. cases have also been reported in other countries. 18 mers has a 35% mortality rate, and since it emerged in the human population in june 2012, it has caused substantial morbidity and mortality. 19, 20 from 2012 until january 15, 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection cases reported globally to the world health organization (who) was 2506, with 862 associated deaths, covering 27 countries (www. who.int/csr/don/31-january-2020-mers-united-arab-emirates/en). cases of mers from other countries were linked to travel to the middle east. 20,21 mers-cov was identified from the saliva of a patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in jeddah (ksa). mers-cov can be detected in respiratory tract secretions, as well as in feces, serum, and urine. [22] [23] [24] in addition, it has been isolated from environmental objects such as bedsheets, bedrails, intravenous fluid hangers, and x-ray devices. 25 in the case of known camel infection, mers-cov was transmitted from a camel to a human, which was confirmed by rna sequencing. 26 at the end of december 2019, the first clusters of patients with pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 were reported in wuhan, china. 27 the basic reproduction number of sars-cov-2 is approximately 2.2, indicating that each patient would on average spread the infection to 2.2 people. 28 human-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 occurred rapidly, and the atypical symptoms during the early stage may be a further disadvantage. 29 moreover, human infection might have begun months prior to the official announcement of the outbreak. 30 to prevent further spread, stricter screening and surveillance are needed at travel hubs. 31 early detection, diagnosis, and treatment are also effective measures to contain the epidemic. 32 nonetheless, the fatality rate of sars-cov-2 is lower than that of sars, 33 with an estimated mortality risk of 2%. 34 sars-cov-2 was first isolated from clinical specimens using human airway epithelial cells and the vero e6 and huh-7 cell lines. 27 approaches to assess virions include isolation from lower respiratory tract specimens 35 and artificially infected specific pathogen-free human airway epithelial cells. 36 fluorescence quantitative pcr with primers designed according to specific sequences and serological testing aimed at igg and igm can be used to detect the virus. 9 sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 pose major challenges to global health, causing infections in large parts of the world. sars-cov was found in 30 countries and mers-cov in 27 countries, while sars-cov-2 was found in 213 countries by 8th may, 2020. details on the pandemics caused by sars-cov-2 are shown in box 1, highlighting the status of the coronavirus-caused diseases worldwide.epidemiological analysis and symptoms of sars, mers, and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) the clinical manifestations of sars include hypoxia, cyanosis, high fever (above 38°c), accelerated breathing or respiratory distress syndrome, and shortness of breath. x-rays show changes to the lungs to varying degrees. the who case definition (2003) includes the following: (1) fever higher than 38°c or history of such in the past 2 days, (2) radiological evidence of new infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, (3) chills, cough, malaise, myalgia, or known history of exposure, and (4) positive test for sars-cov by one or more assays. 37 similar to sars-cov infection, mers-cov infection manifests as a severe lower respiratory tract infection with extrapulmonary involvement and high fatality rates. 19 symptomatic patients may present fever, chills, stiffness, myalgia, discomfort, cough, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. pneumonia is common, and severe infection with acute respiratory failure, renal failure, and shock is particularly frequent among older patients. 20 previous studies have estimated that approximately 12.5-25% of mers-cov infections may be asymptomatic. 20, 38 it must be noted that immunocompromised people are at high risk of mers-cov infection. 21 for covid-19, fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue are most commonly observed at illness onset; less commonly observed are sputum production, hemoptysis, and headache, among others. 29, 35 similar to sars and mers, some patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). 39 around 81% of infected patients only develop mild symptoms, with mild pneumonia or no pneumonia. 14 and 5% are severe and critical status, respectively. 40 patients requiring icu care tend to be much older and are more likely to have underlying comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes. 29 additionally, symptoms such as pharyngeal pain and anorexia are reported at higher rates among those admitted to the icu than among non-icu patients. 29 histopathologically, symptoms such as diffuse alveolar damage (dad), loss of cilia, squamous metaplasia, denudation of bronchial epithelia, and giant-cell infiltrate often occur in the lungs of patients with sars. the number of macrophages increases prominently in the alveoli and the interstitium. 41 according to the morphological changes, observed, most authors have subclassified lung lesions in sars into two or three consecutive phases: an acute exudative inflammatory phase, a fibrous proliferative phase, and a final fibrotic stage, although there is considerable overlap in histological findings among these phases. 42 the main features of the first phase include extensive hyaline membrane formation, edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrin exudation in alveolar spaces. the second phase includes widening of septae, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and organizing fibromyxoid and cellular exudates. 42, 43 the third phase includes septal and alveolar fibrosis. 42 several autopsies of sars patients have demonstrated secondary bronchopneumonia, and the pathogens identified mainly consist of staphylococcus aureus, mucor sp., aspergillus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and cytomegalovirus. 43 sars-cov also greatly affects the immune system. for example, hemorrhagic necrosis is usually obvious in the lymph nodes and spleen. 44 as described above, sars-cov attacks immune cells, especially t cells and macrophages, with approximately 50% of lymphocytes and 30% of monocytes in the circulation becoming infected. 42, 45 under the influence of the virus, the patient's germinal centers disappear, and both t and b lymphocytes are depleted. in the spleen, the white pulp shrinks, hemorrhage and necrosis occur in the red pulp, and the periarterial lymphatic sheaths decrease. 42, 45, 46 with regard to the immune system, sars-cov can infect the lymphoid component of the intestine. for this reason, the patient's submucosal lymphoid tissue atrophies. 47 sars-cov can also infect epithelial cells in the mucosa of the small and large intestines, and the digestive tract may undergo mild diffuse inflammation and atrophy of the submucosal lymphoid tissues. 47 according to previous reports, symptoms in the liver include extensive hepatocyte mitosis, balloon degeneration of hepatocytes, mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltrates, fatty degeneration, and central lobular necrosis. 42 additionally, apoptosis of liver cells has been confirmed in some cases. 48 on autopsy, the kidneys of some sars patients showed focal bleeding and acute tubular necrosis of different degrees. one of the major complications of ards is acute kidney injury. 42, 49, 50 in many other cases, the features are nonspecific, including benign hypertensive nephrosclerosis and autolysis. 42 moreover, researchers have detected viral particles and genome sequences in the cytoplasm of neurons of the hypothalamus and cortex in the brain, 51 which suggests that the virus can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause degeneration and necrosis of neurons, edema, extensive glial cell hyperplasia, and cellular infiltration. 42 pneumocytes and epithelial syncytial cells are important targets of mers-cov. the lung tissue presents dad. severe peripheral vascular diseases, patchy cardiac fibrosis, and hepatic steatosis have also been found in other organs. 52 another symptom is bronchial submucosal gland necrosis. 52 renal biopsy may show acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and acute tubulosclerosis with protein casts. 22 in covid-19 patients, a bilateral (sometimes unilateral) distribution of patchy shadows and ground glass opacity in the lungs is typical, based on ct scans. 29 plasma concentrations of interleukins (ils) 2, 7, and 10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon (ifn)-γ-inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and tumor necrosis factor α are increased in most dying patients. 39, 53 in addition, neutrophilia related to cytokine storms induced by virus invasion, coagulation activation related to a sustained inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury related to the effects of the virus, hypoxia, and shock, may be involved in mortality. 29 those who survive intensive care may experience long-term lung damage and fibrosis due to aberrant and excessive immune responses. 39 moreover, researchers found that as sars-cov-2 spread and changed across generations, clinical symptoms started to differentiate those infected previously from those infected more recently. the initial symptoms are becoming more insidious, which indicates that the virus may gradually evolve into an influenza-like virus and lie dormant for longer in asymptomatic patients. 54 in conclusion, in terms of outbreak times, sars-cov was the earliest, followed by mers-cov, then sars-cov-2. to date, mers-cov has the longest duration of infection, and sars-cov-2 appears to be the most infectious. sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 infections have similar symptoms, including fever, cough, myalgia, and shortness of breath, among others. the common transmission methods and symptoms of the three coronavirus infection are shown in fig. 2 .structural studies of sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 sars-cov is a coronavirus with a diameter of approximately 100 nm. coronaviruses are the largest +ssrna viruses and contain at least 14 orfs, 16 protein combines with viral rna to form a nucleocapsid, which is involved in the replication of sars-cov and is the most abundant protein in virus-infected cells. 56, 57 the m protein is a membrane glycoprotein that is involved in budding and envelope formation. the s protein of sars-cov is a type i transmembrane (tm) glycoprotein that is responsible for viral binding, fusion and entry into cells, as well as antibody induction. 16, 58 the s protein contains a signal peptide (sp: amino acids 1-12) and three domains called the extracellular domain (amino acids 13-1193), the tm domain (amino acids 1194-1215) and the intracellular region (amino acids 1216-1255). 16 the extracellular domain consists of two subunits: s1 and s2. the fragment located in the middle region of the s1 subunit (amino acids 318-510) is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor-binding region. the s2 subunit comprises a fusion peptide (fp) and two x 7-valent element repeats (hr1 and hr2) that are responsible for fusion between the virus and the target cell membrane. 58 thus, the s protein may be key to develop a vaccine to generate antibodies and block virus binding and fusion in the coronaviruses (fig. 3) .the 3′ end of the sars virus genome encodes 12 structural proteins and helper proteins, of which orf3a, orf6, orf7a, and orf7b have been proven to be viral structural proteins involved in the formation of viral particles. the 5′ end of the genome encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), which are important for virus assembly, and may enable the design of small molecule drugs and/or vaccines.mers-cov belongs to lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus (βcov) in the family coronaviridae, order nidovirales, and it is the first lineage c cov and the sixth cov known to cause human infection. mers-cov is an enveloped +ssrna virus similar to other covs, but the amino acid sequence homology between mers-cov and other known covs is less than 90%. 19 orf1a and orf1b located in the first two-thirds of the mers-cov genome are involved in virulence and encode nsps (nsp1-16). the remaining third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, the s, e, m, and n proteins, as well as five accessory proteins (orf3, orf4a, orf4b, orf5, and orf8b). [59] [60] [61] the flanking regions of the genome contain the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (utrs). 62 most mers-cov proteins are found in the cytoplasm. 63 to date, the ns4b protein and the orf3a-encoded protein are the only known coronavirus proteins to be detected in the nucleus. 64 nsp1 suppresses host gene expression in infected cells, and its rna cleavage-inducing function promotes virus assembly/budding. 65 nsp16 is a viral 2′-o-methyltransferase (2′-o-mtase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection, suggesting that nsp16 is a conserved universal candidate for rapid design of a live attenuated vaccine. 66 orf4a's protein can mask viral dsrna to play a role in immune evasion, including type 1 ifn and protein kinase r-mediated antiviral stress responses. 67 mers-cov nsp13 is a full-length coronavirus helicase that contains multiple domains, including an n-terminal cys/his rich domain with three zinc atoms, a beta-barrel domain and a c-terminal superfamily (sf) 1 helicase (sf1) core with two reca-like subdomains. this protein might interfere with the nonsensemediated mrna decay pathway to avoid degradation of viral rna. 68 the mers-cov s protein can recognize dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) on the cell surface, promoting the fusion of the viral envelope and the cell membrane. the mers-cov s protein, a 1353-amino acid type i tm glycoprotein located on the viral envelope surface, is composed of s1 and s2 subunits. 69 the structure of the s protein consists of four parts: an sp located at the n terminus (amino acids 1-12), an extracellular domain (amino acids 13-1195), a tm domain (amino acids 1196-1215), and an intracellular domain (amino acids 1216-1255). 16 the s1 subunit contains two independent domains, an n-terminal domain (ntd, amino acids 18-353) 70 and a c-terminal domain (amino acids 367-588), both of which may function as receptor-binding domains (rbds); 71 these domains serve as critical targets for the development of vaccines and therapeutics 72, 73 and facilitate the involvement of the s1 subunit in cell receptor (dpp4) binding. the core structure of the mers-cov s protein rbd is a five-stranded antiparallel sheet with several short helices, in which three disulfide bonds stabilize the core by connecting c383 to c407, c425 to c478, and c437 to c585. 16, 73 the accessory subdomain of the c-domain is a hypervariable region for receptor recognition fig. 3 clustering of the spike protein of each coronavirus. fifty-four spike protein sequences filtered from each coronavirus coding sequences were clustered using the clans (cluster analysis of sequences) program on the website of mpi bioinformatics toolkit. each colored dot represents the spike protein sequence of each coronavirus. dots in the same color mean they are of the same genus, and each line shows the similarity of two sequences, with darker lines indicating higher similarity (lower e values). the coronaviridae family includes the following genera: alphacoronavirus (colored in green); betacoronavirus (red); gammacoronavirus (orange), and deltacoronavirus (blue). the indicated sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 belong to the genus of betacoronavirus and is called the receptor-binding motif (rbm). the accessory subdomains in sars-cov and mers-cov differ, resulting from divergent evolution and leading to the use of different receptors. 71 dpp4 consists of an n-terminal hydrolase and a cterminal β-propeller domain composed of eight lancets 74 and the rbd. the s2 subunit of mers-cov contains an fp (residues 943-982), an hr1 domain (residues 984-1104), an hr2 domain (residues 1246-1295), a tm domain (residues 1296-1317), and an intracellular domain (residues 1318-1353). 69 the s2 subunit is responsible for fusion between the virus and the target cell membrane. after the s1 subunit binds to dpp4, the s2 subunit inserts its fp into the target cell membrane to change its conformation. its hr1 helix then forms a homotrimer with an exposed surface that has three highly conserved hydrophobic grooves, and binds with hr2 to form a six-helix bundle (6-hb) core structure, which facilitates fusion by bringing the viral and cell membranes into close proximity. 69 the genetic material of mers-cov then enters the host cell via the fusion pore. 69 sars-cov-2, which causes covid-19, is a spherical betacoronavirus with a diameter of 60-140 nm and unique spikes ranging from 9 to 12 nm. 27 its rna has the typical betacoronavirus organization, containing a 5′ utr, a gene encoding the replicase complex (orf1a/b), the s gene, e gene, m gene, and n gene, a 3′ utr, and several unidentified nonstructural orfs. 27, 75 the length of the sequences is 265 nt for the 5′ terminal region, 229 nt for the 3′ terminal region, 3822 nt for the s gene, 228 nt for the e gene, 669 nt for the m gene, and 1260 nt for the n gene. 75 the 21,291nt-long orf1a/b gene contains 16 predicted nsps. 75 similar to sars-cov, there is a predicted orf8 gene that is 366 nt in length and located between the m and n orf genes. 75 nucleotides 1, 1029, and 1652 may be the recombination breakpoints because based on the fragments from nt 1 to nt 1029 and nt 1652 to the end, sars-cov-2 seems to be related to bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21; however, when considering the region from nt 1030 to nt 1651, sars-cov-2 is mostly likely to be grouped with sars-cov and bat sars-like covs. more research is required to analyze the recombination of the genome as a whole. 75 with over 10% of its conserved replicase complex being different from those of other betacoronaviruses, sars-cov-2 solely occupies a newly created subclade within the sarbecovirus subgenus. 27, 75 bats may be its natural host, but owing to several arguments including the complicated environment in the wet markets in wuhan, this remains unclear, and further research is needed. 36, [75] [76] [77] the free energy of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is much lower than that of sars-cov, indicating that sars-cov-2 is more stable than sars-cov. 78 the high similarity of the rbd sequences and of the spike protein structures between sars-cov-2 and sars-cov, 36, 75, 79 also the simulation of the spike protein of sars-cov-2 binding to ace2, 80 the receptor of sars-cov, and results shown that ace2 plays a vital role in sars-cov-2 entry into hela cells, 76 indicating that sars-cov-2 also uses ace2 for cell entry. structural modeling of the ace2-b0at1 complex (b0at1 is used to obtain stable ace2) suggests that the complex can bind two s proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis of coronavirus recognition and infection. 81 the rbd-ace2 binding free energy for sars-cov-2 is significantly lower than that for sars-cov, in accordance with the fact that sars-cov-2 is more infectious than sars-cov. 78 a recent study found that cd147, a kind of tm glycoprotein, facilitates cell entry of sars-cov-2 functionally, and its affinity constant with the s protein is 1.85 × 10 −7 m. 82 table 1 shows a comparison of the structures of sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2. the specific function of the sars-cov-2 proteins, including s, e, m, and n proteins, need further study.in conclusion, sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 are similar in structure. their major proteins are structural proteins, including the s, e, m, and n proteins, accessory protein, and nsps (nsp1-16). all these viruses rely on the s protein to identify cell targets and fuse with membranes. their s proteins are composed of s1 and s2 subunits. the s1 subunit contains an ntd and a c-domain, in which there is an rbd. the accessory subdomain of the c-domain is a hypervariable region for receptor recognition and is called the rbm. the difference is that sars-cov recognizes ace2, sars-cov-2 recognizes ace2 and cd147, but mers recognizes dpp4, which results from the difference between the accessory subdomains of sars-cov, sars-cov-2, and mers-cov. the function of the accessory and nonstructural proteins of these three viruses is related to viral replication and assembly, hence linked to virulence.pathogenesis of sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are nearly identical in terms of invasion and self-replication, whereas mers-cov has different targets. the cellular receptor of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is ace2, plus cd147 for sars-cov-2, while that of mers-cov is dpp4. the human ace2 protein is a typical zinc metallopeptidase that comprises 805 amino acids and contains a single catalytic domain. it is a type i integral membrane glycoprotein that is oriented with an extracellular n terminus and a catalytic site that functions in metabolizing circulating peptides. 83 it is believed that there is a virus-binding hot spot on ace2 that is not pre-existent or preorganized but is induced to form upon virus binding. 84 the hot spot consists of a salt bridge surrounded by hydrophobic tunnel walls. the general structural features of the hot spot favor virus binding: it is located in a region on ace2 that is furthest from the membrane, relatively flat, and free of glycosylation and is thereby easily accessible to viruses. the hot spot is mainly an intrinsic property of ace2, but it is also a dynamic structure and receives structural contributions from both ace2 and the viruses, with the contributions of ace2 being more pronounced. dpp4 is a type ii transmembrane glycoprotein that consists of approximately 766 amino acids. dpp4 contains an n-terminal hydrolase and a cterminal β-propeller domain composed of eight lancets. 74 the s protein rbd binds to the side surface of the dpp4 propeller and the amino acid residues in lancets 4 and 5, including k267, q286, t288, r317, r336, q344, a291, l294, and i295. 74 the pathogenic mechanism of sars-cov is believed to include two parts: the virus injures target cells directly, and subsequent immune system dysfunction leads to indirect injury. 42 sars-cov spreads via droplet and contact transmission and via the fecal-oral route. through droplet inhalation, the virus enters the respiratory tract and invades epithelial cells. infection and replication of the virus and local inflammatory changes contribute to lung tissue damage. subsequently, sars-cov infects circulating and resident immune cells. the key cells in this step consist mainly of t cells and macrophages. the viruses are then carried to other organs, including secondary lymphoid organs, by these circulating immune cells. 42 sars-cov resembles hiv because both viruses attack immune cells and cause immunodeficiency. 42 sars-cov causes lung injury mainly by inhibiting the function of ace2. the virus binds to ace2 via the spike protein, downregulating its function and contributing to lung injury. ace2 is an important component of the renin-angiotensin system (ras). in this system, angiotensinogen is first converted to angiotensini (angi) by renin, and then angiis converted to ang ii under the influence of ace2. ace2 downregulates the levels of angi and ang ii, which can bind to the ang ii type i (at1) receptor and cause certain types of lung injury, mainly pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute lung injury. 85 ang ii can directly induce pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells to grow or proliferate rapidly through at1, thus causing pulmonary hypertension. 86 ang ii contributes to pulmonary fibrosis by promoting the expression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-b1, causing fibroblasts to convert to myofibroblasts and accumulate collagen. 70 several strategies can be used by the virus to escape the innate immune response. normally, viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) are detected by host pattern recognition receptors (prrs). pamps include viral dsrna and mrna, and prrs include retinoic acid-inducible gene i protein (rig-i) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (mda5). production of type i ifn is induced via the nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) pathway. when ifn binds to the ifnα/β receptor, signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) proteins are activated, which increases the production of other antiviral proteins and thus blocks sars-cov replication for further infection. 11 additionally, sars-cov could encode several proteins that hinder the signaling cascades downstream of prrs.the cell receptor of mers-cov is dpp4, which is widely expressed on epithelial cells in the prostate, alveoli, kidneys, liver, and small intestine and on activated leukocytes; thus, the range of mers-cov tissue tropism is broader than that of any other similar coronavirus. mers-cov infection of dendritic cells and macrophages can lead to the continuous production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (such as tnf-α, il-6, cxcl-10, ccl-2, ccl-3, ccl-5, and il-8). 87 compared to sars-cov infection, mers-cov infection can cause higher expression levels of il-12, ifn-γ, ip-10/cxcl-10, mcp-1/ccl-2, mip-1α/ccl-3, rantes/ccl-5, and il-8. 87 induction of immune cell-recruiting cytokines/chemokines might lead to the infiltration of a large number of immune cells into the lower respiratory tract, causing severe inflammation and tissue damage. 87 mers-cov can also infect t cells and lead to apoptosis, avoiding the host immune response and facilitating faster spread. 88 mers-cov has also evolved a mechanism to escape the host cell immune system. when host sensors initiate signaling pathways, transcription of type i ifn genes begins, and the type i ifn response, which is an essential component of antiviral innate immunity, is initiated. [89] [90] [91] ifn activates the transcription of numerous ifn-stimulated genes (isgs) and synthesizes 2′,5′oligoadenylate (2-5a), which causes rnase l activation. [91] [92] [93] activated rnase l can cleave both viral and host ssrna, leading to translation stagnation and apoptosis and limiting virus replication and transmission in vitro and in vivo. 92, 94 however, the mers-cov protein ns4b has phosphodiesterase activity and antagonizes rnase l via enzymatic degradation, leading to inference with ifn signaling. although ns4b is mainly expressed in the nucleus, the expression level of the ns4b protein in the cytoplasm is sufficient to prevent activation of rnase l. 88 in addition, the mers-cov m, orf4a, orf4b, and orf5 proteins are reported to be strong ifn antagonists, among which the orf4a, orf4b, and orf5 proteins inhibit both type i ifn induction 61, 95, 96 and nf-κb signaling pathways, which are similar to the type i ifn signaling pathway, 96 providing a possible mechanism for mers-cov evasion of innate immunity. 88, 96 for sars-cov-2, the first cluster of patients was believed to be associated with a seafood market. 27 however, due to the identification of patients without direct exposure to the market, transmission between humans was proven. 97 hospital-related transmission has also been detected via infected medical workers and hospitalized patients. main routes of transmission include respiratory droplets, close contact, and extended exposure to aerosol environments loaded with high concentrations of virions. in addition to transmission through the respiratory tract, exposure of unprotected eyes to sars-cov-2 might cause acute respiratory infection. 98 notably, the virus can be transmitted during the incubation period. 99 the tm protease serine type 2 (tmprss2) primes the s protein of sars-cov-2 for cell entry. 100 based on analysis of the ace2 rna expression profile in normal human lungs, sars-cov-2 mainly infects type ii alveolar (at2) cells (only 0.64% of human lung cells can express ace2, 83% of which are at2 cells), and they express many other genes that facilitate sars-cov-2 infection; 101 moreover, cd147 was also reported that it probably functionally facilitates cell entry of sars-cov-2. 82 high expression of ace2 has also been detected in cells of the digestive system, such as upper esophageal cells; accordingly, this system is a potential route of infection. 102 in addition to the lungs and intestines, other organs, such as the heart, esophagus, kidney, bladder, testis, ileum, and adipose tissue, also express ace2, and the expression level is higher than that in the lungs. 103, 104 certain tumor tissues have higher expression of ace2, making cancer patients more vulnerable than other people. 104 in conclusion, sars-cov and sars-cov-2 bind cells expressing ace2. they affect the ras system due to the affinity for ace2 (much stronger with sars-cov-2 than with sars-cov), leading to the onset of symptoms. mers-cov causes symptoms by producing inflammatory cytokines and invading t cells. the specific pathogenic mechanisms of these three viruses are illustrated in fig. 4 .diagnostic methods in addition to clinical manifestations, definitive diagnosis and confirmation of a coronavirus infection requires specific testing. the criteria for the diagnosis of sars from the who include (1) fever higher than 38°c or history of such in the past 2 days, (2) radiological evidence of new infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, (3) chills, cough, malaise, myalgia, or known history of exposure, and (4) positive tests for by at least one assay. as for mers, the criteria for the diagnosis according to the who include (1) fever, cough, and hospitalization with suspicion of lower respiratory tract lesion, (2) history of contact with probable or confirmed cases, (3) history of travel or residence within the arabian peninsula, and (4) positive tests by a pcr-based detection method using respiratory samples, such as nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal or tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) and induced sputum, or by serological tests such as the rapid immunochromatographic assay using highly selective monoclonal antibodies at room temperature. the initial criteria for the diagnosis of sars included (1) a history of travel or residence in wuhan within 2 weeks before the onset of illness, (2) exposure to patients from wuhan with fever and respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks before the onset of illness or the existence of clusters of diseases, (3) fever accompanied by radiographic features of pneumonia, a normal or decreased total number of white blood cells, or a decreased lymphocyte count, and (4) fluorescence pcr testing positive for nucleic acids of sars-cov-2. 37, 59, [105] [106] [107] early diagnosis of mers is difficult, but several highly specific and sensitive molecular and serologic assays exist for diagnosis in both animals and humans. 108 among them, a rapid immunochromatographic assay can detect mers-cov antigens based on the detection of the mers-cov nucleocapsid protein in a short time frame; the relative sensitivity and specificity of this test are 93.9 and 100%, respectively. 105 nucleic acid tests, such as real-time pcr tests, were mostly used to detect virus in the early stage of the outbreak of sars-cov-2, although this approach requires a relatively long time and is not conducive to accelerating diagnosis or large-scale application. therefore, alternative, rapid diagnostic kits for sars-cov-2 may be used. for example, the colloidal gold detection kit uses serum, plasma, or whole blood samples to detect igm/igg antibodies for diagnosis on the 7th day of infection or the 3rd day after onset and requires only 15 min. the nucleic acid detection kit for six respiratory viruses, including sars-cov-2 and influenza a virus, uses thermostatic amplifier chips for diagnosis. by detecting different infections, it may help distinguish people with influenza from those with other viral infections. a newly developed fig. 4 pathogenesis of sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2. sars-cov and sars-cov-2 play a pathogenic role by inhibiting ace2. under the influence of renin and ace, angiotensinogen is converted into ang ii. through the at1 receptor, ang ii acts as a lung injury-promoting factor, and in some cases, may cause vascular constriction, an inflammatory response, cell proliferation, fibrosis, and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in diseases such as pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute lung injury. ace2 converts ang ii into ang (1-7), and through the mas receptor, ang (1-7) play roles in vasodilation, antiproliferative activity, and antioxidant activity. sars-cov downregulates the activity of ace2 and causes an increase in the amount of ang ii and lung injury. mers-cov infection of dendritic cells and macrophages can lead to the continuous production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a large number of immune cells infiltrating a patient's lower respiratory tract, causing severe inflammation and tissue damage. mers-cov can infect t-cells from human lymphoid organs and causes the peripheral blood inducing apoptosis by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, thus avoiding host immune response detection method, nanopore targeted sequencing, also has the potential for efficiently detecting viruses in a reasonable time. moreover, it could identify 40 other respiratory viruses and monitor changes in virulence and transmissibility caused by viral mutations. 109 therapeutic agents all patients should be treated in isolation. 53 based on previous studies, drugs may be developed to inhibit cell entry. several strategies have been investigated to identify specific antivirals targeting the s protein, including mers-rbd-targeted nabs that block viral attachment, peptide inhibitors targeting s2 to prevent the formation of the fusion core, and small molecules without defined mechanisms. 110 sdpp4 has been found to bind mers-cov rbd with high affinity, suggesting that sdpp4 could serve as a blocker for mers-cov attachment to and entry into cells. 111, 112 one study reported a monoclonal antibody, 7d10, that binds to the ntd to inhibit cellular entry of mers-cov. 113 experiments have shown that 7d10 not only inhibits the binding of mers-cov to cells but also has effects after viral-cell attachment. 7d10 inhibits virus invasion by blocking the binding of the s1 subunit to the receptor and interfering with the conformational transformation of the s2 subunit when the virus fuses with the cell membrane. 113 a peptide fragment spanning residues 736-761 of the s protein exerts neutralization activity by inhibiting membrane fusion and the entry of mers-cov, suggesting that it is possible to develop vaccines targeting this neutralizing epitope. 114 griffithsin, a lectin derived from red algae, binds to oligosaccharides on the surface of sars-cov s protein and may also prove effective against sars-cov-2. 34, 115 researchers found that antibodies raised against sars-cov, such as css-2, -3, -4, and -5, could cross-neutralize sars-cov-2 by reducing s-driven cell entry, although the efficiency was lower than that observed for sars-cov. 100 meplazumab, an anti-cd147 humanized antibody, binds with the cd147 in competition with the s protein, 116 thus significantly inhibiting virus from invading cells and reducing the time of negative conversion. 82, 106 chloroquine could effectively inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro, and hydroxychloroquine was even more potent than chloroquine. 117, 118 hydroxychloroquine could significantly help reduce the virus load, and azithromycin could reinforce its effect. 119 arbidol could also contribute to condition improvement. 120 note that these studies were generally limited and further trials and development are necessary.protease inhibitors also have the potential for coronavirus therapeutics. protease inhibitors, including disulfiram, lopinavir, and ritonavir, have been reported to be effective against sars and mers, and disulfiram, a drug for alcohol dependence, was reported to inhibit the papain-like protease (plpro) of mers-cov and sars-cov in cell cultures. 34, 108 in vitro, sars-cov can be inhibited by both 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine targeting plpro. 121 when used together with ribavirin, the protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir have improved the outcomes of patients with sars compared with those achieved with the use of ribavirin alone. 122 such inhibitors are also being tested in patients infected with sars-cov-2, but whether these inhibitors effectively suppress 3clpro and plpro of sars-cov-2 remains controversial. 34 drugs such as colistin, valrubicin, icatibant, bepotastine, epirubicin, epoprostenol, vapreotide, aprepitant, caspofungin, perphenazine, prulifloxacin, bictegravir, nelfinavir, and tegobuvir bind to the main protease of sars-cov-2, and thus, are potential candidates. 123 lianhua-qingwen formula, a kind of traditional chinese medicine, has been also recently described theoretically as a potential treatment candidate against the main virus protease. 124 the serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate could partly block sars-cov-2 infection of lung cells by inhibiting tmprss2. 100 viral rna synthesis blockers also have potential. remdesivir has broad-spectrum activity against mers-cov and sars-cov in cell cultures and animal models and is currently in clinical development for the treatment of ebola virus disease. 34, 125 it was also reported positively based on a patient with sars-cov-2 infection in the us, 126 and another study showed that it was able to inhibit the virus. 117 ribavirin is often used to treat sars and mers, but it is uncertain whether it is potent enough against covid-19. 34, 108 regardless, when used alone, ribavirin has minimal activity against sars-cov and may cause strong side effects. it is often used together with corticosteroids. 14,127 a preclinical study of galidesivir (bcx4430), an adenosine analog, revealed antiviral activity against sars-cov and mers-covcov. 115 a study of favipiravir (t-705), a guanine analog, proved its activity against sars-cov-2, and randomized trials of favipiravir plus interferon-α (chictr2000029600), and favipiravir plus baloxavir marboxil (chictr2000029544) are in progress. 34 corticosteroids may be used to treat sars patients to suppress lung inflammation; although this therapy is not associated with mortality in patients with mers, it is associated with delayed clearance of mers-cov rna. 14,128 moreover, clinical evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids for covid-19 treatment. 129 regarding antibodies, plasma therapy using convalescent plasma from fully recovered patients is effective against these coronaviruses, including sars-cov-2. 108, 130 tocilizumab (antihuman il-6 receptor) may curb immunopathology and trials are ongoing now. 131 a study of novel monoclonal antibodies against the mers-cov spike protein suggests that mabs can be utilized for the identification of specific mutations of mers-cov. 132 wang et al. provided an all-hydrocarbon-stapled peptide that likely mimics the native conformation of the c-terminal short α-helical region of the mers-cov s protein, which can block the formation of the hexameric coiled-coil fusion complex to inhibit viral-cell membrane fusion. 133, 134 current treatments for sars mainly include ribavirin, ifn α, plasma therapy, host-directed therapies, and systemic corticosteroids. 14, 41 due to the lack of clinical trial data, adequate supportive care supplemented with different combinations of drugs remains the main treatment for patients. 14, 41 for mers, despite many studies in humans, there is no consensus on the best treatment; thus, randomized clinical trials are needed to assess potential treatment options. 134 several therapeutics are in development, including convalescent plasma, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, ifn and novel therapies, including polyclonal antibodies and broad-spectrum antivirals. 108 antimicrobial peptides (amps) may be used as alternative therapeutic agents, 135 and many have been effective even against bacterial proteases agents. 136 antiviral drugs with effective activity in vitro include neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, antiviral peptides, mycophenolic acid, lopinavir, ifn, ribavirin, nitazoxamide, mycophenolate mofetil (mmf), alisporivir, silvestro, and corticosteroids. 19, 21, 59 although there is no agreement on the most ideal treatment option to cure covid-19, much research activities and pursued routes are underway.potential host-targeted agents the host-directed strategy is another approach for limiting viral replication. host proteases such as cathepsin b and cathepsin l can cleave the spike protein of sars-cov. drugs such as camostat inhibit host serine proteases and then interfere with the entry of sars-cov, but they may cause many significant side effects. 14, 135 pegylated ifn α-2a and -2b may be used to stimulate innate antiviral responses in patients, and chloroquine, an approved immune modulator, was reported to have inhibitory effects against sars-cov-2 under certain conditions. 34 researchers have also proposed that some commercially available drugs with suitable safety profiles, such as metformin, glitazones, fibrates, sartans, and atorvastin, as well as nutrient supplements and biologics, might reduce immunopathology, boost immune responses, and prevent or curb ards. in addition, ongoing cellular therapies using mesenchymal stromal cells from allogeneic donors have been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and are being evaluated in phase 1/2 trials in patients with ards; these therapies may be assayed in sars-cov-2-infected patients. 40, 137, 138 expansion of antiviral t cells as cellular drugs could aid in preparing t cell products for adjunct treatment of patients with severe infection. 40 overall, there are similarities and differences among the treatments for these three coronaviruses. notably, we summarize the potential drugs and vaccines in table 2 .vaccination could be used to prevent infection or to reduce disease severity. different kinds of vaccines, such as dna vaccines, recombinant proteins, subunit vaccines, and inactivated viruses, were described. 14 however, the highly sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms of viral pathogens and their high mutation rates make human vaccine development a major challenge. 136 the four nsps (3clpro, plpro, helicase, and rdrp), which are key enzymes in the viral life cycle, and the s protein, which is responsible for receptor binding during cell entry, are attractive targets for developing vaccines against coronaviruses. 115 among them, the s protein is most commonly targeted. 61 based on previous studies, it is believed that the s protein receptor-binding domain (s-rbd) located in the s1 subunit is an important target for the development of a sars vaccine, especially the key neutralizing region, cnd. indeed, cnd can induce a strong neutralizing antibody response and crossprotection against sars-cov mutants. one study showed that a recombinant fusion protein (designated rbd-fc) containing the 193-amino acid rbd and a human igg1 fc fragment can induce highly potent antibody responses in immunized rabbits. the antibodies inhibited sars-cov infection (serum dilution of 1:10,240), and they are believed to be safer than other types of vaccines. 139 additionally, with chloroplast transgenic technology, it is possible to combine the fusion gene s-rbd and the carrier molecule cholera toxin b subunit into the tobacco chloroplast genome to obtain a chloroplast transgenic tobacco plant that stably expresses the oral sars-cov subunit vaccine. 140 for mers, vaccines based on the viral s protein include full-length s or strimer protein-based vaccines such as a full-length s-based simian adenovirus vector vaccine (chadox1) and dna vaccine (gls-5300), 61 s1-based vaccines such as an ad vector encoding mers-cov s1 extracellular domain (ad5.mers-s1) and an rabv vector encoding an s1-elicited antibody, 141, 142 rbd-based vaccines, and vaccines based on other regions. it has been confirmed that the s proteins of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are quite similar, but researchers recently found that the three monoclonal antibodies developed to bind to the s protein of sars-cov, s230, m396, and 80r do not cross-react with the s protein rbd of sars-cov-2, simian adenovirus vector vaccine (chadox1);an ad vector encoding mers-cov s1 extracellular domain (ad5.mers-s1); an rabv vector encoding s1 elicit antibody; rbd-based vaccines 61, 138, 139, 140 overview of lethal human coronaviruses chen et al. suggesting that tailored vaccines and antibodies against sars-cov-2 must be designed. 143 dna vaccines are also quite promising. specific igg antibodies against sars-cov can be promoted by the s gene dna vaccine. as mentioned above, the s protein of sars-cov plays an important role during the pathogenic process, and synthetic peptides induced by dna vaccine in escherichia coli elicit specific antibodies against the sars-cov s protein which might provide another approach for further developing sars-cov vaccines. 42, 144 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a plasmid dna vaccine (gls-5300) that expresses the s protein of mers-cov, a phase i clinical trial on healthy volunteers was conducted in 2016, but the results were not reported. another phase i trial utilizing the viral vector, chimpanzee adenovirus, oxford university #1 (chadox1), containing the mers-cov s protein expression gene was started by oxford university in january 2018. 145 in addition, camel vaccines against mers-cov are a consideration. at present, at least two promising candidate camel vaccines are undergoing development, and field trial evaluation is in progress. 108, 146 one study found that the rbd fragment covering spike residues 377-588 is a key neutralizing receptor-binding fragment and an ideal candidate for mers vaccines. 147 another potential neutralizing epitope is a peptide fragment covering 736-761 residues of the s protein which blocks the membrane fusion and cellular entry of mers-cov 114 (fig. 5) .other approaches recombinant viruses may be employed to generate an immune response against the viruses. there are two kinds of recombinant viruses which are promising for designing a protective vaccine. the first is a defective or nonpathogenic vector capable of expressing viral proteins, and the second is a vector that can be assembled in a test tube to stimulate the assembly of virus-like particles.adenosine deaminase (ada), a kind of human enzyme, could interact with dpp4, therefore, ada could compete with mers-cov as a natural antagonist when the virus attempts to bind to cells. 148 in addition, anti-dpp4 can play a similar role, 149 however, it is not practical to use this method in vivo because dpp4 has important functions in the regulation of several different signaling pathways. 150 questions concerning the coronavirus-host interactions this topic has intrigued the community. understanding certain mechanisms about virus interactions will support drug research activities. for instance, it was found that sars-cov-2 has a stronger, more rapid spreading ability than many known viruses. is it possible that it invades host cells via additional novel routes, not limited to ace2? for example, cd147 is probably involved in virus invasion. 82 is there an s-like protein involved in invasion? the affinity of the human ace2 protein for the rbd of the new coronavirus is 10-20 times higher than it is for that of the sars virus, which likely explains why sars-cov-2 spreads more swiftly. there is a distinct insert present in the peptide fragment spanning of s1/s2 loop of the sars-cov-2 s protein, which is not shared the similarity with sars-cov or any sars-related viruses. does this peptide loop impact on the entry pathway type of sars-cov-2, compared to other known betacoronavirus lineage b? furthermore, the s protein is likely cleaved during virus assembly and delivery to the cell surface by golgi-resident proprotein convertases such as furin, 151 which is different from the behavior of its close relatives. furin is found in a variety of human tissues, including the lungs, liver, and small intestine. therefore, which are exactly the cell types that sars-cov-2 may attack? yet, in relation to the last two questions, it should be noted that studies are also necessary to investigate any possibility of receptor-independent virus entry.the sars-cov-2 genome encodes nonstructural proteins, structural proteins, and accessory proteins. 3clpro, plpro, helicase, and rdrp, which belong to the first type, and the s protein, which belongs to the second, have been recognized as promising targets for developing antiviral agents against sars-cov and mers-cov, which therefore may be applied to sars-cov-2. nonetheless, the rapid identification of effective interventions against sars-cov-2 is a major challenge. however, the subject of using currently known antiviral drugs has been frequently brought up by the community as a potential short-term strategy to combat sars-cov-2.drugs affecting such targets and their status for sars-cov-2 are listed below. the main candidates as inhibitors of 3clpro include other agents for sars-cov-2 fig. 5 the targets of the different drug candidates against the three coronaviruses. common targets against the three coronaviruses are mainly the s protein and the s1/s2 subunits, pl protein, rdrp, 3cl protein, and helicase. the figure shows drug candidates (in black) and vaccines (in red). among them, remdesivir has been trending in the news recently. it inhibits the rdrp, is in phase iii for sars-cov-2, and may have an effect on the three viruses. ribavirin in combination with a pegylated interferon may also have an effect against the three viruses. ritonavir and lopinavir, which inhibit the 3clpro and are in phase iii for sars-cov-2, have an effect on both sars-cov-2 and mers-cov. dna vaccines and vaccines based on the s protein or subunits of the s protein are in development lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, cobicistat, and asc09f (phase iii, in combination with oseltamivir, for sars-cov-2). 152 candidates as inhibitors of plpro include thiopurine analogs, compound 6 (preclinical), and remdesivir (phase iii for mars-cov). 121, 153 favipiravir, ribavirin (randomized trial for sars-cov-2), and remdesivir are among the candidate inhibitors of rdrp. 118 previously, compounds that may interfere with atpase and helicase activities were reported (before covid-19), such as bananins, 5-hydroxychromone derivatives, and triazole derivatives (preclinical). 34, 78 candidates that may suppress viral entry by targeting the s protein include peptide p9 and α-helical lipopeptides (preclinical), 154 and those targeting the s2 subunit of the s protein mainly include hr1p, hr1m, hr1l, hr2l, hr2p, and hr2l (preclinical). 155 due to the strong affinity between ace2 receptor and the rbd of sars-cov-2, another opportunity might be through the development of antibodies to block ace2. the second method is to use a large amount of soluble ace2 to directly block the spike protein. the third method is to find a drug that directly inhibits the spike membrane fusion process, such as the aids drug enfuvirtide. the fourth approach is to identify an agent that inhibits the activity of disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (adam17), which may also prevent viral release and proliferation in cells and protect ace2 and the lungs. 87 mrna vaccine technology sars-cov-2 vaccines are already under development. the mrna and dna vaccines are promising approaches to prevent cellular invasion by similar coronaviruses in the future. in january 2020, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) announced three partnerships to develop a new coronavirus vaccine. among them, moderna and inovio presented mrna and dna vaccine technologies, respectively. the goal of the three teams is to have at least one candidate vaccine capable of preventing coronavirus infection in 16 weeks, to be tested in a phase i clinical trial.moderna's vaccine model is designed to use mrnas to safely pre-expose the immune system to a small amount of encoded proteins usually generated by the pathogen, so that the immune system becomes prepared to fight future pathogens and prevent infection. the candidate genes developed by moderna contain mrnas, and combining multiple mrnas into a single vaccine might be useful to rapidly induce responses, which is an approach that may be applied for future, emerging pandemic threats too. at the same time, because the mrna in the cell will be degraded over time, the mrna vaccine will not continue to produce antigen components for a long time, which can avoid the risk of continued stimulation of the immune system. generally, mrna vaccines are also described as simple to prepare and to yield remarkable results. additional advantages, as well as disadvantages, of nucleic acid-based vaccines were described in detail. furthermore, the basis of traditional vaccines, proteins or polysaccharides, cannot be straight forward applied at present against many pathogens. therefore, mrna vaccines would be suitable for achieving rapid, mass production of emergency vaccines in the event of a major epidemic. however, because rna is easily degraded, inducing cells to absorb mrna quickly is a challenge. in recent years, the method for delivery of mrna into cells has been greatly improved, and stemirna and moderna have adopted nanolipid (lpp or lnp (lipid nanoparticle)) drug-loading technology. however, this is still to be developed for mrnas. furthermore, ensuring safety and effectiveness is another challenge for viral mrna vaccines, and clinical validation will have to be carried out carefully.moderna is a worldwide leader in mrna therapy, with currently nine mrna-type vaccine candidates (e.g., mrna-1273 against sars-cov-2). the national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) of the national institutes of health (nih) and the mrna vaccine giant moderna have teamed up to bring the new coronavirus vaccine possibly to phase ii within a few months, and phase iii late this year. simultaneously, in january 2020, the translational medicine platform of dongfang hospital affiliated with tongji university cooperated with stemirna (shanghai) biotechnology co., ltd. to rapidly promote the development of a new coronavirus mrna vaccine. in february 2020, the chinese scientific research team announced that animal testing of the newly developed coronavirus vaccine has begun. if animal testing goes well, this new vaccine will enter human clinical trials within a few months. also in february 2020, zhuhai livanda biotechnology co., ltd. announced that the first batch of new coronavirus mrna vaccine standard samples completed during the spring festival had been delivered to relevant national authorities on for animal testing and efficacy verification. the researchers detected the production of target antibodies in mouse serum at day 12 following immunization. the company claimed that this was also the first time worldwide that new coronavirus vaccines developed based on mrna technology have resulted in antibodies in animals. livanda is currently pushing ahead with the project through extensive cooperation with the academy of military medical sciences, the guangdong provincial institute of supervision, and the macau university of science and technology. the antigen used in its development is the same as that used by moderna.dna vaccine technology dna vaccine technology may have many advantages (e.g., safe, fast, less technical barriers), along with potential limitations too. 156 a phase i human clinical trial of the mers-cov vaccine has proven its safety and effectiveness. 157 the dna vaccine based on the sars-cov s protein developed by the team of barney graham and gary nabel of the us-nih vaccine research center (vrc) has achieved positive results in animal experiments and a clinical phase i trial. 158, 159 inovio pharmaceuticals has accumulated extensive safety and immunogenicity data for mers-cov vaccine studies. because of the high degree of similarity between mers-cov and sars-cov-2, lessons from such a vaccine development process may be beneficial for the development of a dna vaccine against sars-cov-2. since january 2020, inovio has been collaborating with several experts and companies (some in china), and has currently already begun phase i clinical trials of the dna vaccine ino-4800.china's cansino biologics might be the leader as it was announced it has moved to phase ii testing of a vaccine called ad5-ncov. the latter is currently often being reported as a dna vaccine, but to be precise, it uses viral vectors (adenovirus) to deliver dna related to sars-cov-2. part of the project is carried out currently with the chinese military medical research institute. the vaccine candidate is constructed using genetic engineering methods and defective human type 5 adenovirus as a vector that can express the sars-cov-2 s antigen, to stimulate the body to produce strong humoral or cellular immunity.sars-cov and mers-cov belong to subgroups 2b and 2c of the betacoronaviruses, respectively, and sars-cov-2 is a new member of betacoronaviruses, distinct from sars-cov and mers-cov. sars-cov and sars-cov-2 are similar in terms of invasion and self-replication, whereas mers-cov has different targets. the cellular receptor of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 is ace2, plus cd147 for sars-cov-2, while that of mers-cov is dpp4 (cd26). all of them evolved a mechanism to escape the host cell immune system. sars-cov and sars-cov-2 affect the ras system by suppressing ace2, leading to the onset of symptoms. mers-cov causes symptoms by producing inflammatory cytokines and invading t cells. sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 infections have similar symptoms, including fever, cough, myalgia, and shortness of breath, among others. current treatments for sars mainly include ifn-α, antiviral treatments (e.g., ribavirin), plasma therapy, host-directed therapies, and systemic corticosteroids. for mers, several therapeutics are in development, including convalescent plasma, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, ifn, and novel therapies, including polyclonal antibodies, broad-spectrum antivirals, and amps. for covid-19, candidates mainly include drugs targeting the s protein, nonstructural proteins (3clpro, plpro, helicase, and rdrp), and viral rna synthesis blockers such as remdesivir and ribavirin. vaccines such as dna vaccine, mrna vaccine, and recombinant vaccines are being rapidly developed.so far this century, human beings have experienced several epidemic outbreaks, and each outbreak had a negative impact at different levels, including health, economy, and even psychology and human behavior. in the future, more precautious measures should be available to guide individuals and groups to take effective emergency measures and to support social stability, and physical and mental health. furthermore, additional studies of coronaviruses and disease epidemics should continue, to support the preparation for future responses, medical therapies, vaccines, and methods of relieving personal anxiety. this review has highlighted several approaches, and the names and progress related to several compounds and biologics currently under research and development, as well as the companies and researchers involved in these efforts. for future directions, it has also described the differences and similarities, as well as the potential routes and possibilities for targeting each of the main three viruses investigated here.the rotaviruses (rvs) compose a genus within the family reoviridae, and comprise seven distinct groups (a-g), of which groups a-c rotaviruses are those currently found in both humans and animals, whereas viruses in groups d-g have been found only in animals to date (knipe and peter, 2007) . the rotavirus genome is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded rna and can undergo genetic reassortment during mixed infections, leading to progeny viruses with novel or atypical phenotypes. there were numerous descriptions of rotavirus strains isolated from human and animals that share genetic and antigenic features of viruses from heterologous species (matthijnssens et al., 2006; rahman et al., 2005; santos and hoshino, 2005) . recently, there were reports of novel rotaviruses that are apparently derived from transmission between human and sheep (ciarlet et al., 2008; matthijnssens et al., 2009) . the emergence of novel strains derived from interspecies transmission has implications for design and implementation of successful reassortant rotavirus vaccine strategies.group a bovine rotaviruses (brvs) are the most important cause of diarrheal diseases in neonatal calves and cause significant morbidity and mortality in the young animals, and epidemiologic surveillance of bovine rotavirus g genotypes conducted in various cattle populations throughout the world has shown that approximately 90% of the bovine rotavirus isolates belong to g6 and g10. based on the modified jennerian approach to immunization, we constructed and characterized a reassortant rotavirus stain, which bears a single bovine rotavirus vp7 gene encoding g genotype 6 specificity while the remaining 10 genes are derived from the ovine attenuated rotavirus llr-85. the reassortant rotavirus strain, named as r191, and its parental virus strain llr-85 were combined as bivalent vaccine candidates to inoculate the colostrums-deprived neonatal calves for evaluation of the immunogenicity. the calves were orally inoculated with the reassortant r191 (group 1), the parental rotavirus llr-85 (group 2), or combined the r191 and llr-85 (group 3), and serum specimens were detected to determine the immune response of igg and iga antibodies. results showed that seroconversion to positivity for igg and iga antibodies occurred at postinoculation day (pid) 10 in all of the inoculated calves, and the highest titers of the serum igg (range 1:800 to 1:6400) and iga (range 1:800 to 1:3200) antibodies were obtained at pid 21 for all calves. meanwhile, virus shedding was detected after inoculation, showing that the inoculated virus was positive in 2 of 77 fecal specimens (2.6%) collected from the inoculated calves during the first 7 days of oral inoculation with the rotavirus vaccine candidates. the results suggested that the rotavirus strains r191 and llr-85 are promising bivalent vaccine candidates for the prevention of bovine g6 and g10 rotavirus infection.ß 2010 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.in prior studies, a dual classification system based on the two major outer capsid proteins defines several g and p genotypes of group a rotaviruses. to date, 23 g and 31 p genotypes have been identified based on the glycosylated vp7 and the protease-sensitive vp4 (schumann et al., 2009; ursu et al., 2009) . recently, a novel classification system based on the nucleotide sequences of all rotavirus genome segments has been suggested (matthijnssens et al., 2008a,b) enabling a comprehensive characterization of rotavirus strains. based on nucleotide identity cut-off percentages, different genotypes were defined for each genome segment. the calculated cut-off values for the 11 rotavirus rna segments vp7, vp4, vp6, vp1, vp2, vp3, nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp5/6 are 80%, 80%, 85%, 83%, 84%, 81%, 79%, 85%, 85%, 85% and 91%, respectively. to designate the complete genetic makeup of a virus, the schematic nomenclature was proposed: gx-p[x]-ix-rx-cx-mx-ax-nx-tx-ex-hx, representing the genotypes of respectively the vp7-vp4-vp6-vp1-vp2-vp3-nsp1-nsp2-nsp3-nsp4-nsp5/6 encoding gene segments, with x indicating the number of the corresponding genotypes.group a rotaviruses, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route and selectively infect the mature villous absorptive epithelial cells (holland, 1990) , cause disease that varies in severity, including asymptomatic infection, mild and self-limiting diarrhea, or severe diarrhea with excessive fluid loss and severe electrolyte imbalance. diarrhea is one of the most important diseases of neonatal dairy and beef calves, and substantial economic loss occurs due to increased morbidity and mortality, treatment costs, and reduced growth rates (house, 1978) . for example, livestock and poultry production with $70 billion per year industry in the united states is estimated to suffer a 15-20% annual loss in potential productivity from disease and environmental problems (united states department of agriculture, 1987) , in which, calf loss from diarrhea is an important segment of total loss in cattle industry. it was reported in the late 1970s that enteric pathogens killed up to 25% of calves per year, resulting in more than $250 million in losses (hunt, 1985) . rotavirus, coronavirus, escherichia coli strain k99, coccidia and cryptosporidium parvum are the main infectious agents inducing enteric infections in neonatal calves less than 2 months of age. among the pathogens described above, rotavirus as a major cause of neonatal bovine diarrhea (bellinzoni et al., 1990; bendali et al., 1999; de la fuente et al., 1998; maes et al., 2003; reynolds et al., 1986 ) was found to be responsible for approximately 46% of the scours cases in dairy calves (snodgrass et al., 1986) . in addition to causing economic losses, diarrhea in livestock is important because of the public health implications. thus, the availability of a safe and effective bovine rotavirus vaccine capable of preventing this enormous economic and public health burden would represent a global goal.the advent in 1998 of the first licensed human rotavirus vaccine, a rrv (rhesus rotavirus) -based quadrivalent vaccine (rotashield tm , wyeth-lederle vaccines and pediatrics, philadelphia, pa) (kapikian, 2001) , provided an impetus for the expansion of programs of global human rotavirus strain surveillance and assessment of the rotavirus disease burden. in addition, availability in the early 1990s of a reliable and relatively easy methodology for rotavirus g and p genotyping accelerated this trend (das et al., 1994; fischer and gentsch, 2004; gentsch et al., 1992; gouvea et al., 1990) . such information has indeed influenced the approaches to the development of an effective rotavirus vaccine. for example, additional candidate human rotavirus vaccines have been constructed that would give antigenic coverage not only for g1-g4 but also g5, g6 and g8-10 as well as p1a[8], p1b[4] and p2a[6] . however, there was limited research in the field of animal rotavirus vaccine. the bovine rotavirus isolate (the lincoln strain, g6 genotype) was adapted to serial propagation in cell culture (fernelius et al., 1972; mebus et al., 1971) , which resulted in an attenuated virus for calves (mebus et al., 1973) . this attenuated strain was incorporated into a vaccine licensed by the us department of agriculture (usda) in 1973 for oral inoculation of newborn calves or intramuscular inoculation of pregnant cows to provide passive protection to their calves. apart from this, there was no advent of new bovine rotavirus vaccine in the world.field surveys have demonstrated that, so far, g genotype g6 and g10 are the epidemiologically most important bovine rotavirus genotypes worldwide, accounting for 90% of the rotavirus-caused diarrhea approximately. next to the g6 and g10 genotypes, g8 is the third typical bovine rotavirus genotype (alfieri et al., 2004; chang et al., 1996; falcone et al., 1999; garaicoechea et al., 2006; monini et al., 2008; parwani et al., 1993; reidy et al., 2006; snodgrass et al., 1990) . in china, our epidemiologic surveillance has shown that rotavirus diarrhea is one of the most important diseases of neonatal calves, and that g6 and g10 were also determined to be the most prevalent genotype of the bovine rotaviruses using nested rt-pcr and sequencing (chang et al., 2008) . since monovalent rotavirus vaccine cannot completely protect against heterologous rotavirus infection (feng et al., 1994) , the multivalent rotavirus vaccine candidates are the most important research goal for the protective immunity of rotaviruses. in addition, the reassortant rotavirus vaccine approaches have been successfully employed to develop various human rotavirus candidate vaccines that include rhesus rotavirus based and bovine rotavirus based multivalent vaccines listed earlier (hoshino et al., 2002 (hoshino et al., , 2003 midthun et al., 1985 midthun et al., , 1986 . in this study, an ovine rotavirus strain llr-85-based bovine rotavirus reassortant was constructed and combined with its parental virus llr-85 as bivalent vaccine candidates for providing an attenuation phenotype of an ovine rotavirus in bovines and antigenic coverage of the main bovine rotavirus genotypes for g6 and g10. our study showed that the bivalent vaccine candidates can induce immune response of igg and iga antibodies in the sera of the inoculated colostrum-deprived neonatal calves, and fecal shedding of rotavirus is uncommon following oral inoculation of calves with the rotavirus vaccine candidates.the bovine rotavirus strain ncdv (g6 p[1]), which was originally isolated in the stool of a neonatal calf with diarrhea in nebraska, usa, in 1971 (fernelius et al., 1972 , was obtained commercially from china institute of veterinary drug control, beijing. the ovine rotavirus strain llr-85 (g10 p[15]) (chen et al., 2009; knipe and peter, 2007) , which was initially derived from a lamb with diarrhea in qinghai province, china, in 1981 (zhou et al., 1985 , was propagated from monovalent human rotavirus vaccine llr (lanzhou institute of biological products, china) (bai et al., 1994) . these virus strains were adapted to growth in ma104 cell line, and passaged 10 times on dmem medium (gibco) before a triple plaque purification. colostrum-deprived newborn calves without antibodies to rotavirus were divided into three groups to orally inoculate candidate vaccines within 24 h after their birth. the calves were kept separate from each group and fed the substituted milk.primers for the amplification of gene segments vp4, vp6, nsp1, nsp2, nsp4 and nsp5 were synthesized (table 1 ) based on the previous study (park et al., 2006) . rt-pcr was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step of 60 min at 42 8c, followed by pcr for activation at 94 8c for 5 min, 30 cycles of amplification (45 s at 94 8c, 45 s at 55 8c, and 60s at 72 8c for vp4, vp6, nsp1, and nsp4 and 45 s at 94 8c, 45 s at 50 8c, and 60s at 72 8c for nsp2 and nsp5), with a final extension of 10 min at 72 8c. the pcr amplicons were purified with the gel extraction kit (tiangen biotech co., ltd., china) and sequenced by shanghai sangon biological engineering technology & services co., ltd., china. the sequences were analyzed with lasergene software, version 7.2.rna polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) was done as previously described (chudzio et al., 1989) . briefly, the supernatant of the culture lysates were mixed with an equal volume of rna extraction buffer (0.02 m trishydrochloride [ph 7.4], 0.3 m nacl, 0.01 m mgcl 2 , 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.005 m edta, 4% sucrose and 0.04% bromophenol blue), and each preparation was mixed with an one-tenth volume of phenol-chloroform (1:1) and vortexed for 30 s to yield a homogeneous suspension followed by spinning in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 â g for 10 min. the upper layer (dark blue solution) containing the double-stranded segments of rna was collected and stored at 4 8c or à20 8c for electrophoretic analysis by the standard 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. genomic rnas were electrophoresed at 10 ma for 16 h and the resulting migration patterns were visualized by staining of gel with silver nitrate.confluent cell line of fetal rhesus monkey kidney, ma104, was co-infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of one with bovine rotavirus strain ncdv and ovine rotavirus strain llr-85. when approximately 75% of the infected cells exhibited cytopathic effects, the cultures were frozen and thawed three times and the lysate was plated on ma104 cells in a six-well plate for selection of the desired reassortant. each desired reassortant was plaque purified three times in ma104 cells and then its genomic rnas were analyzed by page to confirm the origin of genes of each reassortant. when the parental origin of a gene was questionable by page, the indistinguishable rna segments were analyzed by sequence analysis for confirmation.the plaque assay was performed with techniques similar to those of matsuno et al. (1977) . briefly, ma-104 cell monolayers were prepared in six-well tissue culture dishes and washed three times with pbs buffer. serial tenfold dilutions of virus prepared in dmem (without fbs) were inoculated in 0.2-ml amounts. after 1 h of adsorption at 37 8c, each culture received 2 ml of agar overlay medium, which consisted of 1% purified agar in dmem containing 5 mg of trypsin per ml. after the agar overlay solidified, the dishes were placed in an inverted position in a co 2 incubator at 37 8c for 3-5 days. then an equal amount of a second agar overlay medium, containing 1% purified agar in dmem and 0.003% neutral red was added, and plaques were counted the next day.two calves were orally inoculated with 3.6 â 10 6 tcid 50 of the attenuated llr-85, two calves were orally inoculated with 3.2 â 10 6.5 tcid 50 of the reassortant r191, and seven calves were orally inoculated simultaneously with 1.8 â 10 6 tcid 50 of the attenuated llr-85 and 1.6 â 10 6.5 tcid 50 of the reassortant r191 (table 2) . rectal swab specimens were collected each day over the 7-day experimental period postinoculation to detect rotavirus. blood samples were collected at postinoculation days (pids) 0, 10, 21 and 28, processed for serum, and kept at à20 8c until they were tested.plates were coated overnight at 4 8c with semipurified brv or mock-infected cell culture supernatant in 0.1 m carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (ph 9.6), followed by a blocking step of 1 h at 37 8c with 5% nonfat dry milk. the plates were washed three times with 0.5% tween 20 in pbs, ph 7.4. serial twofold dilutions, starting at 1:100, of each test sample were added to duplicate wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 8c. after washing, the plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against bovine igg or iga (with dilution of 1:5000 and 1:2000, respectively) for 1 h at 37 8c. after washing, the plates were incubated with 1.8% tmb (3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine) substrate for 20 min at room temperature. the reaction was stopped with 2 m h 2 so 4 . the a 450 was read by using an elisa plate-reader (zenyth 3100, hvd anthos). the elisa antibody titer of each sample was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that had a corrected a 450 value (sample absorbance in the virus-coated well minus sample absorbance in the mock antigen-coated well) greater than the cut-off value (mean corrected a 450 of negative controls + 3sd) (parreno et al., 1999; to et al., 1998) .in view of rotavirus genotypes g6 and g10 predominating in cattle worldwide, and the jennerian and modified jennerian approaches being successfully employed to develop various rotavirus candidate vaccines, we constructed g10-based bovine rotavirus reassortant followed by molecular and biological characterization. ma104 cells were co-infected with bovine rotavirus strain ncdv and ovine rotavirus strain llr-85 at an m.o.i. of one, and the progeny viruses grew without selective pressure for generating resssortant. 450 plaques were picked to screen for llr-85-based reassortant with single ncdv-vp7 gene substitution. all plaques were routinely picked for initial screening by rna page analysis, and the indistinguishable rna segments were further analyzed by sequence analysis for confirmation. as indicated in fig. 1 , electrophoretic migration patterns of genomic rnas of the parental viruses table 2 inoculation of colostrums-deprived calves with rotavirus vaccine candidates and detection of rotavirus in the fecal specimens.calf no. inoculum postinoculation day on which rotavirus was detected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 1 r191 à à à à à à à 7 à à à à à à à 2 8 llr-85 à à à à à à à 11 à à à à à à à 3 2 llr-85 + r191 à à à à à à à 3 à à à à à à à 4 + à + à à à à 5 à à à à à à à 6 à à à à à à à 9 à à à à à à à 10 à à à à à à à ''à'' refers to being negative for rotavirus by rt-pcr.

evaluate the humoral immune responses induced by the oral administrations of the reassortant rotavirus r191 and one of its parental viruses llr-85, the colostrumsdeprived newborn calves without antibodies to rotavirus were orally inoculated with the reassortant r191 and/or the parental virus llr-85 within 24 h after their birth as described in table 2 . two calves in the group 1 were inoculated with the reassortant r191, another two calves in the group 2 were inoculated with the parental rotavirus llr-85, and seven calves in the group 3 were simultaneously inoculated with the reassortant r191 and the parental rotavirus llr-85. blood samples were collected at pids 0, 10, 21 and 28 to prepare serum. all sera were diluted hundredfold to detect igg and iga antibodies to group a rotavirus by indirect elisa. the kinetics of rotavirus-specific igg and iga antibodies in sera of the calves inoculated with the rotavirus vaccine candidates were depicted in fig. 3 . results showed that seroconversion of igg and iga antibodies to the rotavirus occurred at pid 10 in all of the inoculated calves, and increased to the peak at pid 21. serum samples at pid 21 in all of the calves were serially twofold diluted starting at a dilution of 1:100 followed by detection of the titers of rotavirus-specific igg and iga antibodies to group a rotavirus by indirect elisa.the results showed that the titers of serum igg antibodies were between 1:800 and 1:6400 and the titers of serum iga antibodies were between 1:800 and 1:3200 (table 4) .in order to determine the profile of virus shedding after inoculation of the rotavirus vaccine candidates, fecal rotavirus shedding was investigated each day over the 7-day experimental period postinocuation. low-speed centrifugation supernatants of suspensions of rectal swab specimens were detected and typed by rt-pcr (gouvea et al., 1990 (gouvea et al., , 1994 , and results are described in table 2 . results showed that in the three inoculated groups during the first 7 days of oral inoculation with the rotavirus vaccine candidates, 2 of 77 fecal specimens (2.6%) collected from the 11 inoculated calves contained the inoculated rotavirus. the two rotavirus-positive specimens were collected from the same calf (no. 4) in the group 3 at the first and third day postinoculation. no inoculated rotavirus was detected in other fecal specimens collected from the inoculated calves between 1 and 7 days postinoculation. in prior study (theil and mccloskey, 1995) , rotavirus was detected in 1 of 41 daily fecal specimens collected from the calves following oral inoculation with a usda-licensed modified live bovine rotavirus-coronavirus vaccine. in our study, the low shedding rate (2/77, 2.6%) was similar to the result (1/ 41, 2.4%) of previous study, indicating that our vaccine candidates are safe and well tolerated in the colostrumsdeprived neonatal calves.in 1969, a previously unrecognized virus recovered from diarrheic calves in nebraska, usa, was described and shown to induce diarrhea in experimentally inoculated, hysterectomy-derived, colostrum-deprived calves (mebus et al., 1969) . this virus was initially referred to as neonatal calf diarrhea virus, nebraska calf diarrhea virus, reo-like virus, or reovirus-like agent but is now known as bovine rotavirus; the name rotavirus was ultimately chosen because of the wheel-like appearance of the virus on transmission electron microscopy (tem). today rotaviral infections are proven to be a common, economically important cause of calf diarrhea throughout the world. genotypic analyses of a major neutralization protein vp7 of a bovine rotavirus in diarrheal stools collected in different cattle populations throughout the world have shown that the majority of typeable rotavirus isolates belong to g genotypes 6 and 10 (alfieri et al., 2004; chang et al., 1996; falcone et al., 1999; garaicoechea et al., 2006; monini et al., 2008; parwani et al., 1993; reidy et al., 2006; snodgrass et al., 1990) . since the first licensed bovine rotavirus vaccine was a monovalent one, monovalent rotavirus vaccine cannot completely protect against heterologous rotavirus infection (feng et al., 1994) . we constructed a reassortant rotavirus strain r191 that contains a single vp7 gene encoding genotype g6 specificity of bovine rotavirus ncdv strain and the remaining 10 genes of ovine rotavirus strain llr-85. the reassortant r191 and its parental rotavirus strain llr-85 were used as bivalent vaccine candidates to provide: (i) an attenuation phenotype of an ovine rotavirus in bovines; and (ii) antigenic coverage for g6 and g10 of the main bovine rotavirus genotypes. the attenuated virus strains r191 and llr-85 were shown experimentally in colostrum-deprived neonatal calves to be able to induce high levels of serum igg and iga antibodies to rotavirus, whereas fecal shedding of the rotaviruses was uncommon in the inoculated calves, and therefore are promising bivalent vaccine candidates for prevention of bovine g6 and g10 rotavirus infection.the benefits for using the llr-85 strain instead of an attenuated bovine rotavirus strain in production of the reassortant for vaccine purposes are that the former is attenuated in calves due to host range restriction, but the latter is often unstable and may develop back mutation, thus the llr-85 is more safe to calves; secondly, the passage history of the llr-85 is clear, it is an attenuated strain to lambs and children (bai et al., 1994) therefore should be safe to people and there is no public health problem; thirdly, the rna segments of the llr-85 are easily distinguished on the page electrophoretic migration pattern, which is useful to identify the reassortant; lastly and importantly, the llr-85 strain is highly immunogenic to neonatal calves.some nucleotide mutations of the vp4, nsp1, vp6 and nsp2 gene segments of the r191 occurred in the process of 1  7  8  1 1  2  3  4  5  6  9  1 0   igg  1600  1600  800  800  3200  6400  3200  1600  3200  800  3200  iga  800  800  800  800  1600  3200  1600  1600  1600 800 1600 a the calves in the group 1 were inoculated with the r191, the calves in the group 2 were inoculated with the llr-85 and the calves in the group 3 were simultaneously inoculated with the r191 and llr-85.generation and purification of the reassortant. there existed the insignificant differences of 2 nucleotides (nt), 1nt, 1nt and 1nt between the r191 and the parental llr-85 for the vp4, nsp1, vp6 and nsp2 gene segments, respectively. obviously, the possible reasons to induce these nucleotide mutations were serial tissue culture passage for the six-time plaque purifications of the reassortant r191 on ma104 cells. the mechanisms responsible for immunity to rotavirus infections and illness are not completely understood in animals (knipe and peter, 2007) . animal models have been particularly instructive in elucidating the role of antibodies and in dissecting the relative importance of systemic and local immunity. initially, the observations of some related studies suggested that antibodies in the lumen of the small intestine were the primary determinant of resistance to rotavirus illness, whereas circulating serum antibodies failed to protect offit and clark, 1985; snodgrass and wells, 1976; woode et al., 1975) . but the subsequent study showed that systemic rotavirus antibodies are present in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract of neonatal calves if the level of circulating antibodies is sufficiently high. such serum-derived mucosal antibodies can provide protection against experimentally induced infection and diarrhea (besser et al., 1988) . the association between the titers of serum anti-rotavirus igg and iga antibodies and protection against infection and illness was investigated in 100 children under 18 months of age attending day care centers in the united states for one or two rotavirus seasons (o'ryan et al., 1994) . these studies showed that preexisting serum anti-rotavirus iga titer of greater than 1:200 or igg titer of greater than 1:800 was associated with protection against infection. a similar study of mexican infants also demonstrated that both serum iga and igg were protective, but the titers needed to achieve significant protection were higher than those found in the us study (velazquez et al., 2000) . these previous studies about the association between serum anti-rotavirus antibodies and protection against infection and illness suggested that serum antibodies, if present at critical levels, are either protective themselves or are an important and powerful correlate of protection against rotavirus disease, even though other host effectors may play an important role as well. in this study, we want to evaluate the immunogenicity of the rotavirus vaccine candidates, so we used the major structural protein in virus particles of the semipurified brv as antigen to detect the igg and iga antibodies against the group a rotavirus in serum of the inoculated calves. and the results showed that the highest titers of serum igg and iga antibodies were obtained at pid 21, the calves in all inoculated groups developed high levels of serum anti-rotavirus igg antibodies (range 1:800 to 1:6400) and serum anti-rotavirus iga antibodies (range 1:800 to 1:3200). these results suggested that the animals inoculated with llr-85-based vaccine candidates would develop antibodies to the inoculated viruses, and indicated that the attenuated virus strains llr-85 and r191 were well immunogenic to neonatal calves, and preexisting serum anti-rotavirus iga titers (range 1:800 to 1:3200) reached to level of protective immunity. however, further evaluation is needed for a protective immune response of the llr-85based candidate vaccines in future trials.to date, there is no criterion for fecal shedding rate of the rotavirus vaccine strains. in prior study, vaccine rotavirus was detected in only 1 of 41 daily fecal specimens collected from the calves following oral inoculation with a usda-licensed modified live bovine rotavirus-coronavirus vaccine by using negative stain electron microscopy. in contrast, rotavirus was demonstrable by the same negative stain electron microscopic examination procedure in 17 of 19 fecal specimens collected from the calves after inoculation with virulent bovine rotavirus field strains (theil and mccloskey, 1995) . in our study, vaccine rotavirus was detected in only 2 of 77 daily rectal swab specimens collected from 11 neonatal calves following oral inoculation with the rotavirus vaccine candidates. this low shedding rate (2/77, 2.6%) was similar to the result of previous study (1/41, 2.4%), suggesting that the r191 and llr-85 are safe to calves based on the uncommon fecal shedding of the rotavirus.the procedure that we have used in the present study for the successful construction and selection of the single vp7 gene substitution reassortant rotavirus vaccine is relatively easy to perform. in recent years, rare genotypes of bovine rotavirus (such as g5 and g15.) were also isolated in calves (ghosh et al., 2008; park et al., 2006) . so with this procedure, additional llr-85-based reassortant rotavirus vaccine candidates that carry vp7 gene encoding a desired bovine rotavirus g genotype specificity can be generated readily in the future when the need for such g genotype(s) is warranted from epidemiologic studies.in recent decades, the world has been shaken by the emergence and spread of new viral diseases. although the world's response to the 2014-2015 ebola epidemic was laudable, there is a general consensus that much more could have been done to prevent the deaths of thousands of people and billions of dollars of economic damage as a result of this epidemic (1) . despite many laboratory studies of candidate vaccines, before the trials of the vesicular stomatitis virus-ebola virus vaccine (merck, kenilworth, new jersey) in guinea in 2016, no vaccine had ever been developed in time to alter the course of a new disease outbreak, and that vaccine arrived late in the epidemic (2) . until quite recently, coordination of stakeholder responses across institutions and sectors has lagged behind the epidemic curves of emerging infectious diseases (eids) (3) . research and development (r&d) priorities for improving preparedness have been driven primarily by bioterrorism concerns in some countries, leaving sparse product development pipelines for eids that fall outside national security agendas (2) . in addition, development of eid countermeasures has been unappealing for manufacturers, who see little commercial benefit, because of the sporadic disease burden and lengthy, risky, and costly product development (4) .these challenges notwithstanding, the west african ebola epidemic led to a paradigm shift in eid preparedness (5, 6) . experimental vaccines and therapeutics were deployed during this outbreak, thanks to over a decade of r&d into biodefense-related ebola countermeasures and because the vesicular stomatitis virus-ebola virus vaccine manufactured by merck demonstrated effectiveness in field trials (7) . how-ever, none of these products was ready to deploy in time to change the course of the outbreak, due to the insufficiency of clinical data on safety and efficacy plus absence of product stockpiles. although the trials assessing the vesicular stomatitis virus-ebola virus vaccine did not commence until late in the epidemic, their success suggested a pathway for better preparedness against future epidemics: namely, advancement of biomedical countermeasures through human trials in anticipation of emergencies and making the most promising of these quickly available for efficacy testing and use if and when emergencies were to occur.in acknowledgment that a better system would be needed to improve the world's preparedness and response capacity against future epidemic threats (3, (8) (9) (10) , several important initiatives were launched shortly after the 2014-2015 ebola epidemic had been contained. in may 2016, the world bank established the pandemic emergency finance facility to quickly release funds to affected countries for epidemic responses (11) . at the same time, the world health organization (who) published its blueprint priority diseases list for eid preparedness and response, identifying 11 pathogens with the potential to cause severe outbreaks in the near term. the initial list, as of may 2016 (8) (12) , comprised crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (priority list); ebola virus disease, marburg virus disease (priority list); lassa fever (priority list); mers-cov, severe acute respiratory syndrome (priority list); nipah and henipaviral diseases (priority list); rift valley fever (priority list); zika virus (priority list); disease x (priority list); arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers other than lassa fever (watchlist); chikungunya (watchlist); highly pathogenic coronaviral diseases other than mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome (watchlist); emergent nonpolio enteroviruses, including ev71, d68 (watchlist); and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (watchlist).earlier that year, inspired by a call for a new vaccine fund (5), global thought leaders from governments, industry, and civil society also met at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, and agreed to explore new ways to drive product innovation for high-priority epidemic threats (13) .after the davos 2016 meeting, 3 task teams convened in 2016 between february and june to define sustainable solutions for development of eid vaccines to improve global preparedness and response capacity (6, (11) (12) (13) . the task teams comprised 200 thought leaders and experts representing more than 80 organizations, who drew insights from who blueprint priorities (12) , industry, and civilsociety perspectives on the role of vaccines for the prevention of humanitarian crises caused by eids. each task team explored challenges for the development of eid vaccines that could be used in epidemics, including pathogen prioritization, clinical development, manufacturing capacity, regulatory pathways, models for product development partnerships, and funding strategies (13, 14) .task team recommendations led to the formation of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) (13, 14) . a coalition by design, cepi reflects an explicit awareness that no organization can drive vaccine development against known eids or unknown pathogens of epidemic potential (i.e., disease x) alone. only together, through a multilateral and collaborative approach, can the complexities of vaccine development and delivery be addressed for the public good. as such, cepi was formally launched at the 2017 world economic forum meeting in davos, with close to us$500 million initial funding from the governments of norway, japan, and germany, the bill & melinda gates foundation, and wellcome (15) .cepi's initial strategic objectives, established in 2016 (13) , were aimed at advancing vaccine candidates against each of its first priority pathogens (lassa virus, mers-cov, a nipah virus) through to evidence of safety and immunogenicity in humans (phase 2a) by 2022 and to establish a diverse portfolio of platform technologies that can accelerate development, manufacture, and clinical evaluation of vaccines in response to outbreaks of new eids, designated "disease x" by who. in january 2019, cepi expanded its list of priority pathogens to include chikungunya and rift valley fever. according to initial estimates, a minimum of $1 billion would be required to bring at least 4 eid vaccines through to the end of phase 2a trials and to fund investigational stockpiles of these in case of an international health emergency (16) .two years into operation, cepi has already secured more than $750 million to support its mission, through the contributions of 7 government donors, the european commission, and 2 philanthropic organizations. three calls for proposals have been issued, inviting applications for r&d investment. two of these calls invited applications for vaccine development against specific priority eids: initially against lassa virus, mers-cov, and nipah virus (17) , and more recently against rift valley fever and chikungunya. another call invited applications for rapid-response platform technologies to accelerate development of vaccines in response to epidemic outbreaks of known eids or of unexpectedly emerging infections (disease x) (18) . socalled vaccine platform technologies comprise standardized, reproducible manufacturing processes that can be adapted to produce vaccines against different pathogens. the flexibility of these platforms improves manufacturing efficiency and can shorten the overall time frame for vaccine development (19) (20) (21) .cepi has also recently invited proposals for bloodspecimen collection from survivors of lassa fever to support improved characterization of immune response and support development of assays and standards. should this approach prove effective for lassa virus, cepi will also consider expanding it for mers-cov and nipah virus. as of september 2019, cepi has signed 16 partnership agreements with vaccine development partners (table 1) . these agreements will enable accelerated development of lassa, mers-cov, nipah, and rift valley fever vaccine candidates over 5 years from the late preclinical phase to phase 2, and manufacture of an investigational stockpile for use in large-scale efficacy trials during an outbreak, as well as late-stage clinical development of advanced chikungunya vaccines to accelerate regulatory approval so at-risk populations have access to these vaccines.so far, cepi has initiated projects to develop 17 vaccine candidates against its priority pathogens-including 5 against lassa virus, 4 against mers-cov, 4 against nipah virus, 2 against rift valley fever, and 2 against chikungunya-and 3 vaccine manufacturing platforms. to demonstrate the advantage of these platforms, additional vaccine candidates will be produced and tested, including 2 against influenza, 2 against rabies, 1 against mers-cov, 1 against marburg virus, 1 against lassa fever, 1 against respiratory syncytial virus, and 1 against yellow fever. (26) . other approaches, such as rna vaccines, are in earlier phases of development but show great promise for application against multiple pathogens and rapid production. in addition, cepi has set aside funds to support the development of ebola vaccines. this research funding will be complementary to current efforts in this field, and investments will be coordinated with other funders, where necessary, to avoid duplication of work.over the past 2 years, cepi has made efforts to engage and coordinate its work with partners throughout global health and vaccine development. to ensure the sustainability of its approach to vaccine development, the coalition has been working with industry partners-from small biotechnology companies to large manufacturers-through partnerships that share the risks of vaccine development (table 1) .cepi also coordinates its efforts with several multilateral partners, principally through an interinstitutional roundtable, which we refer to as the joint coordination group. the joint coordination group includes who and key organizations responsible for vaccine procurement, delivery, and implementation, as well as representatives of important regulatory agencies, and works to identify ways in which predictable access to vaccines for priority populations can be achieved in emergency situations. the overall goal for the joint coordination group is to optimize allocation of resources across disease areas and vaccine development, to minimize funding overlap with partners, and to improve response times to unexpected epidemic threats. preparing for the next epidemic requires investment in platforms capable of rapid vaccine development and coordination among multiple stakeholders, to which cepi and its coalition partners have committed substantial resources and attention.as cepi begins to turn its promises into progress, several challenges ought to be acknowledged. first, vaccine development is widely acknowledged as a long, complex process, often lasting over 10 years from discovery to licensure (27) . second, vaccine development is inherently risky, with at least two-thirds of preclinical vaccine candidates likely to fail before reaching clinical proof of concept (28) .in view of this risk of failure, the full cost of successfully advancing a vaccine candidate from preclinical to clinical efficacy trials and readiness for emergency use can vary, on average, from $300 million to $500 million (28) . cepi has so far committed more than $458 million to eid vaccinedevelopment projects, and whereas the full costs of vaccine development are expected to be shared with funding and development partners, concrete clinical outcomes are likely going to take several years to materialize. if vaccines were to be developed for all of the eids prioritized by who, an average $2.8-3.7 billion would be needed to support vaccine development through phase 2 trials, depending on cost structures of vaccine development programs and r&d pipeline attrition (28) . improved coordination among industry, global health, and civil-society institutions, and guidance from regulators will also be needed to determine the public health needs for key diseases and to iron out technical and regulatory pathways for feasible vaccine development.as additional resources become available (29) , cepi is diversifying its current vaccine r&d investment portfolio to include additional pathogens, beginning with chikungunya, a debilitating mosquito-borne disease spread by aedes aegypti and a. albopictus, that affects millions of people globally, and rift valley fever, a viral zoonosis of cattle and other domesticated livestock that also infects humans (30) . chikungunya infection can lead to substantial morbidity; patients can experience arthralgia for months or even years, and chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease develops in small subset of patients (28) . the substantial burden of this disease, for example, coupled with a large vaccine pipeline relative to other eids, could justify investments that might yield clinically relevant outcomes in a shorter time. the quantity of antigen is generally expected to be different across eids; however, not knowing what quantity of antibody would be required to induce protection against chikungunya could make the identification of situations that would allow statistical demonstration of efficacy challenging. feasibility of development would consequently depend on technical hurdles and regulatory guidance for appropriate clinical trial design.in the case of rift valley fever, 9 outbreaks have occurred between 2000 and 2016, with more than 4,600 confirmed and suspected cases and more than 950 deaths (31) . viral transmission in people occurs primarily through contact with the blood or organs of infected animals (31) . however, aedes and culex mosquitoes can also act as viral reservoirs and vectors (31) . rift valley fever has a wide geographical range, spreading throughout africa and into the saudi arabian peninsula (32) . risk of further spread into europe and north america is also high (31) . no licensed vaccine is available for human use, but at least 2 vaccine candidates are currently in phase 2 trials (28) .definition of regulatory pathways for clinical trials and emergency use will need to account for the specifics of each vaccine and the challenges posed by each eid. at present, it is unclear how regulatory processes for vaccine candidates could be accelerated in the event of an outbreak of known eids or disease x. enhanced regulatory guidance and normative directions by coalition partners will be needed for approval of clinical trials and equitable access to eid vaccines during outbreaks.prioritization of various countermeasures (e.g., human vaccine vs. animal vaccines, or their combinations) might also be required to optimize development of the most effective preparedness strategies for unexpected emergencies related to eid outbreaks, such as rift valley fever and mers-cov. as eid threats evolve, increased coordination with who and public health agencies worldwide will be required to ensure product development is prioritized accordingly.sustainable manufacturing solutions will also need to be negotiated soon for vaccine candidates nearing completion of safety and immunogenicity testing in humans. mechanisms for funding and maintaining global stockpiles of investigational vaccines must be established. as vaccine candidates continue to move through development, cepi and its coalition partners soon must lay out a concrete plan for how such a procurement and stockpiling system could be established, how much a system would cost, by whom it would be operated, and when it would need to be operationalized.eids remain a major threat to global health security 4 years after the 2014-2015 ebola outbreak in west africa. this threat is only likely to grow in the coming years as various ecological, demographic, and economic factors accelerate disease emergence and re-emergence. in 2018 alone, there were outbreaks of 6 of the 10 who priority pathogens (33), including 2 separate ebola outbreaks in the democratic republic of congo. thankfully, thousands of doses of the vesicular stomatitis virus-ebola virus vaccine have already been manufactured and the vaccine's rollout will help avert a large-scale epidemic. in the context of ebola, cepi plans to make r&d investments that complement current research efforts.thanks to partnership efforts between cepi and a broad range of vaccine developers, 5 vaccine candidates against lassa fever, 4 for mers-cov, and 4 for nipah virus are under development; 2 rift valley vaccine candidates are about to initiate late-stage preclinical development; and 2 chikungunya vaccine candidates are about to resume latestage clinical development with additional cepi funding. some of these vaccine candidates hopefully will meet the safety and immunogenicity profiles required for investigational stockpiling and use in large clinical trials and humanitarian responses in outbreak conditions. the development of 3 rapid-response platform technologies for other threatening eids has also been initiated, including pilots for lassa fever, mers-cov, influenza, rabies, respiratory syncytial virus, marburg virus, and yellow fever. cepi will continue to enhance epidemic preparedness through targeted funding and technical oversight. ultimately, however, cepi's success will depend on the strength of the coalition's collaborative efforts across sectors, institutions, and geographic regions to develop effective eid vaccines and to ensure equitable access to them in global health emergencies.in recent decades, the world has been shaken by the emergence and spread of new viral diseases. although the world's response to the 2014-2015 ebola epidemic was laudable, there is a general consensus that much more could have been done to prevent the deaths of thousands of people and billions of dollars of economic damage as a result of this epidemic (1) . despite many laboratory studies of candidate vaccines, before the trials of the

to the insufficiency of clinical data on safety and efficacy plus absence of product stockpiles. although the trials assessing the vesicular stomatitis virus-ebola virus vaccine did not commence until late in the epidemic, their success suggested a pathway for better preparedness against future epidemics: namely, advancement of biomedical countermeasures through human trials in anticipation of emergencies and making the most promising of these quickly available for efficacy testing and use if and when emergencies were to occur.in acknowledgment that a better system would be needed to improve the world's preparedness and response capacity against future epidemic threats (3, (8) (9) (10) , several important initiatives were launched shortly after the 2014-2015 ebola epidemic had been contained. in may 2016, the world bank established the pandemic emergency finance facility to quickly release funds to affected countries for epidemic responses (11) . at the same time, the world health organization (who) published its blueprint priority diseases list for eid preparedness and response, identifying 11 pathogens with the potential to cause severe outbreaks in the near term. the initial list, as of may 2016 (8) (12) , comprised crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (priority list); ebola virus disease, marburg virus disease (priority list); lassa fever (priority list); mers-cov, severe acute respiratory syndrome (priority list); nipah and henipaviral diseases (priority list); rift valley fever (priority list); zika virus (priority list); disease x (priority list); arenaviral hemorrhagic fevers other than lassa fever (watchlist); chikungunya (watchlist); highly pathogenic coronaviral diseases other than mers and severe acute respiratory syndrome (watchlist); emergent nonpolio enteroviruses, including ev71, d68 (watchlist); and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (watchlist).earlier that year, inspired by a call for a new vaccine fund (5), global thought leaders from governments, industry, and civil society also met at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland, and agreed to explore new ways to drive product innovation for high-priority epidemic threats (13) .after the davos 2016 meeting, 3 task teams convened in 2016 between february and june to define sustainable solutions for development of eid vaccines to improve global preparedness and response capacity (6, (11) (12) (13) . the task teams comprised 200 thought leaders and experts representing more than 80 organizations, who drew insights from who blueprint priorities (12) , industry, and civilsociety perspectives on the role of vaccines for the prevention of humanitarian crises caused by eids. each task team explored challenges for the development of eid vaccines that could be used in epidemics, including pathogen prioritization, clinical development, manufacturing capacity, regulatory pathways, models for product development partnerships, and funding strategies (13, 14) .task team recommendations led to the formation of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) (13, 14) . a coalition by design, cepi reflects an explicit awareness that no organization can drive vaccine development against known eids or unknown pathogens of epidemic potential (i.e., disease x) alone. only together, through a multilateral and collaborative approach, can the complexities of vaccine development and delivery be addressed for the public good. as such, cepi was formally launched at the 2017 world economic forum meeting in davos, with close to us$500 million initial funding from the governments of norway, japan, and germany, the bill & melinda gates foundation, and wellcome (15) .cepi's initial strategic objectives, established in 2016 (13) , were aimed at advancing vaccine candidates against each of its first priority pathogens (lassa virus, mers-cov, a nipah virus) through to evidence of safety and immunogenicity in humans (phase 2a) by 2022 and to establish a diverse portfolio of platform technologies that can accelerate development, manufacture, and clinical evaluation of vaccines in response to outbreaks of new eids, designated "disease x" by who. in january 2019, cepi expanded its list of priority pathogens to include chikungunya and rift valley fever. according to initial estimates, a minimum of $1 billion would be required to bring at least 4 eid vaccines through to the end of phase 2a trials and to fund investigational stockpiles of these in case of an international health emergency (16) .two years into operation, cepi has already secured more than $750 million to support its mission, through the contributions of 7 government donors, the european commission, and 2 philanthropic organizations. three calls for proposals have been issued, inviting applications for r&d investment. two of these calls invited applications for vaccine development against specific priority eids: initially against lassa virus, mers-cov, and nipah virus (17) , and more recently against rift valley fever and chikungunya. another call invited applications for rapid-response platform technologies to accelerate development of vaccines in response to epidemic outbreaks of known eids or of unexpectedly emerging infections (disease x) (18) . socalled vaccine platform technologies comprise standardized, reproducible manufacturing processes that can be adapted to produce vaccines against different pathogens. the flexibility of these platforms improves manufacturing efficiency and can shorten the overall time frame for vaccine development (19) (20) (21) .cepi has also recently invited proposals for bloodspecimen collection from survivors of lassa fever to support improved characterization of immune response and support development of assays and standards. should this approach prove effective for lassa virus, cepi will also consider expanding it for mers-cov and nipah virus. as of september 2019, cepi has signed 16 partnership agreements with vaccine development partners (table 1) . these agreements will enable accelerated development of lassa, mers-cov, nipah, and rift valley fever vaccine candidates over 5 years from the late preclinical phase to phase 2, and manufacture of an investigational stockpile for use in large-scale efficacy trials during an outbreak, as well as late-stage clinical development of advanced chikungunya vaccines to accelerate regulatory approval so at-risk populations have access to these vaccines.so far, cepi has initiated projects to develop 17 vaccine candidates against its priority pathogens-including 5 against lassa virus, 4 against mers-cov, 4 against nipah virus, 2 against rift valley fever, and 2 against chikungunya-and 3 vaccine manufacturing platforms. to demonstrate the advantage of these platforms, additional vaccine candidates will be produced and tested, including 2 against influenza, 2 against rabies, 1 against mers-cov, 1 against marburg virus, 1 against lassa fever, 1 against respiratory syncytial virus, and 1 against yellow fever. (26) . other approaches, such as rna vaccines, are in earlier phases of development but show great promise for application against multiple pathogens and rapid production. in addition, cepi has set aside funds to support the development of ebola vaccines. this research funding will be complementary to current efforts in this field, and investments will be coordinated with other funders, where necessary, to avoid duplication of work.over the past 2 years, cepi has made efforts to engage and coordinate its work with partners throughout global health and vaccine development. to ensure the sustainability of its approach to vaccine development, the coalition has been working with industry partners-from small biotechnology companies to large manufacturers-through partnerships that share the risks of vaccine development (table 1) .cepi also coordinates its efforts with several multilateral partners, principally through an interinstitutional roundtable, which we refer to as the joint coordination group. the joint coordination group includes who and key organizations responsible for vaccine procurement, delivery, and implementation, as well as representatives of important regulatory agencies, and works to identify ways in which predictable access to vaccines for priority populations can be achieved in emergency situations. the overall goal for the joint coordination group is to optimize allocation of resources across disease areas and vaccine development, to minimize funding overlap with partners, and to improve response times to unexpected epidemic threats. preparing for the next epidemic requires investment in platforms capable of rapid vaccine development and coordination among multiple stakeholders, to which cepi and its coalition partners have committed substantial resources and attention.as cepi begins to turn its promises into progress, several challenges ought to be acknowledged. first, vaccine development is widely acknowledged as a long, complex process, often lasting over 10 years from discovery to licensure (27) . second, vaccine development is inherently risky, with at least two-thirds of preclinical vaccine candidates likely to fail before reaching clinical proof of concept (28) .in view of this risk of failure, the full cost of successfully advancing a vaccine candidate from preclinical to clinical efficacy trials and readiness for emergency use can vary, on average, from $300 million to $500 million (28) . cepi has so far committed more than $458 million to eid vaccinedevelopment projects, and whereas the full costs of vaccine development are expected to be shared with funding and development partners, concrete clinical outcomes are likely going to take several years to materialize. if vaccines were to be developed for all of the eids prioritized by who, an average $2.8-3.7 billion would be needed to support vaccine development through phase 2 trials, depending on cost structures of vaccine development programs and r&d pipeline attrition (28) . improved coordination among industry, global health, and civil-society institutions, and guidance from regulators will also be needed to determine the public health needs for key diseases and to iron out technical and regulatory pathways for feasible vaccine development.as additional resources become available (29) , cepi is diversifying its current vaccine r&d investment portfolio to include additional pathogens, beginning with chikungunya, a debilitating mosquito-borne disease spread by aedes aegypti and a. albopictus, that affects millions of people globally, and rift valley fever, a viral zoonosis of cattle and other domesticated livestock that also infects humans (30) . chikungunya infection can lead to substantial morbidity; patients can experience arthralgia for months or even years, and chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease develops in small subset of patients (28) . the substantial burden of this disease, for example, coupled with a large vaccine pipeline relative to other eids, could justify investments that might yield clinically relevant outcomes in a shorter time. the quantity of antigen is generally expected to be different across eids; however, not knowing what quantity of antibody would be required to induce protection against chikungunya could make the identification of situations that would allow statistical demonstration of efficacy challenging. feasibility of development would consequently depend on technical hurdles and regulatory guidance for appropriate clinical trial design.in the case of rift valley fever, 9 outbreaks have occurred between 2000 and 2016, with more than 4,600 confirmed and suspected cases and more than 950 deaths (31) . viral transmission in people occurs primarily through contact with the blood or organs of infected animals (31) . however, aedes and culex mosquitoes can also act as viral reservoirs and vectors (31) . rift valley fever has a wide geographical range, spreading throughout africa and into the saudi arabian peninsula (32) . risk of further spread into europe and north america is also high (31) . no licensed vaccine is available for human use, but at least 2 vaccine candidates are currently in phase 2 trials (28) .definition of regulatory pathways for clinical trials and emergency use will need to account for the specifics of each vaccine and the challenges posed by each eid. at present, it is unclear how regulatory processes for vaccine candidates could be accelerated in the event of an outbreak of known eids or disease x. enhanced regulatory guidance and normative directions by coalition partners will be needed for approval of clinical trials and equitable access to eid vaccines during outbreaks.prioritization of various countermeasures (e.g., human vaccine vs. animal vaccines, or their combinations) might also be required to optimize development of the most effective preparedness strategies for unexpected emergencies related to eid outbreaks, such as rift valley fever and mers-cov. as eid threats evolve, increased coordination with who and public health agencies worldwide will be required to ensure product development is prioritized accordingly.sustainable manufacturing solutions will also need to be negotiated soon for vaccine candidates nearing completion of safety and immunogenicity testing in humans. mechanisms for funding and maintaining global stockpiles of investigational vaccines must be established. as vaccine candidates continue to move through development, cepi and its coalition partners soon must lay out a concrete plan for how such a procurement and stockpiling system could be established, how much a system would cost, by whom it would be operated, and when it would need to be operationalized.eids remain a major threat to global health security 4 years after the 2014-2015 ebola outbreak in west africa. this threat is only likely to grow in the coming years as various ecological, demographic, and economic factors accelerate disease emergence and re-emergence. in 2018 alone, there were outbreaks of 6 of the 10 who priority pathogens (33), including 2 separate ebola outbreaks in the democratic republic of congo. thankfully, thousands of doses of the vesicular stomatitis virus-ebola virus vaccine have already been manufactured and the vaccine's rollout will help avert a large-scale epidemic. in the context of ebola, cepi plans to make r&d investments that complement current research efforts.thanks to partnership efforts between cepi and a broad range of vaccine developers, 5 vaccine candidates against lassa fever, 4 for mers-cov, and 4 for nipah virus are under development; 2 rift valley vaccine candidates are about to initiate late-stage preclinical development; and 2 chikungunya vaccine candidates are about to resume latestage clinical development with additional cepi funding. some of these vaccine candidates hopefully will meet the safety and immunogenicity profiles required for investigational stockpiling and use in large clinical trials and humanitarian responses in outbreak conditions. the development of 3 rapid-response platform technologies for other threatening eids has also been initiated, including pilots for lassa fever, mers-cov, influenza, rabies, respiratory syncytial virus, marburg virus, and yellow fever. cepi will continue to enhance epidemic preparedness through targeted funding and technical oversight. ultimately, however, cepi's success will depend on the strength of the coalition's collaborative efforts across sectors, institutions, and geographic regions to develop effective eid vaccines and to ensure equitable access to them in global health emergencies.structural analyses have shown that this novel virus uses host cell receptor known as angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 for its binding [4] . transmission dynamics confirmed that reproductive number (r0, which signifies the number of people who can get infected from one contagious person) of sars-cov-2 can be in the range of 2-3, and thus has the potential to spread rapidly [5] . based on the clinical and epidemiological data from the chinese health authorities, clinical manifestations of the disease by severity have shown that mild cases occur in 81% of cases, severe disease is seen in 14% of cases and critical disease has occurred in 5% of cases [6] . considering the infectivity and the severity of covid-19, vaccines and therapeutics to tackle this deadly disease are the greatest need of the hour.global pandemic is a major public health concern. modern means of travel and the volume of travel make it easier for any virus to rapidly spread across the world. pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime low-probability event but a high-cost problem that should not be ignored. the next pandemic was anticipated to be a more virulent form of influenza but the world is currently in the midst of a novel coronavirus pandemic.though middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and sars were featured in the who's list of critical infectious diseases in 2018, it was not anticipated to cause a global disease within a short span of time [7] . such is the unpredictability of a global pandemic that the world is currently facing.as the infectivity of the sars-cov-2 virus is very high compared to other corona viruses reported so far, an effective vaccine is the best way to contain the rapidly escalating proliferation of this infection. although the mortality rate is lower compared to other similar viral respiratory diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), the magnitude of the infection caused by sars-cov-2 is severe and higher, to a large extent, leading to increased number of deaths worldwide.sars-cov-2 infection has the potential to become a seasonal disease like influenza and persist with humanity in the future [8] . an effective vaccine can help in reducing the rate of infection, and can significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of covid-19. vaccine can also the world is currently facing an unprecedented global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). predicting the next source of the pandemic can be very challenging. as vaccination is the best way to prevent an infectious disease, the development of an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 can not only reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with it, but can also lessen the economic impact. as the traditional method of vaccine development takes many years for a vaccine to be available to the society, the vaccine development for sars-cov-2 should be speeded up using a pandemic approach with fast-track approvals from the regulatory authorities. various challenges associated with developing a vaccine during the pandemic such as technological hurdles, clinical development pathways, regulatory issues, and support from global funding agencies are expressed here.published online: april 15, 2020; pii: s097475591600163 decrease the probability of resurgence of the disease and its future impact. the implementation of an effective vaccination is the only way to moderate the economic burden of this unprecedented pandemic.there is an urgent need to expedite the development of covid-19 vaccine. the vaccine industry was able to develop h1n1 vaccine fairly rapidly because the technology and regulations were already in place to develop influenza vaccine. global experiences with influenza vaccines have outlined the urgency for investing in modern technologies for faster vaccine development as well as increasing the scale of production. customizing these technologies to various other viruses can speed up vaccine development during a pandemic.organizations such as coalition for epidemic preparedness innovation (cepi), an innovative global partnership between public and private organizations are striving to quicken vaccine development for various potential and critical diseases, as well as facilitate uniform availability of these life-saving vaccines. cepi aims to develop vaccines for various pathogens till phase 2a stage, which can be expedited to full-scale development during future outbreaks [9] .cepi and the world bank organized a conference on the three main imperatives for covid-19 vaccine effort: speed, manufacture and deployment at scale, and global access, which has ultimately led to the formulation of covid-19 vaccine development taskforce [10] .the wide ranges of technologies that are being developed for sars-cov-2 include nucleic acids, protein subunit, replicating viral vector, non-replicating viral vector, and inactivated virus approaches. newer approaches based on nucleic acids such as dna or mrna can facilitate potentially rapid production, as they do not need fermentation [9] . for some platforms, adjuvants could improve the immune responses with lower doses thus ensuring vaccination of larger populations without any reduction in efficacy [11] . currently, several platforms are being developed and the list of sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates in development is given in web table 1 .the development of a vaccine for sars-cov-2 can cause distinct challenges.• developing a viable immunogen using the various proteins of sars-cov-2 such as s protein, n protein, m protein is the initial challenge.• development of successful animal model for covid-19 may be challenging although two animal models; one hace2 transgenic mice model and another, primate macaques model have been successfully developed. this may be due to the highly infectious and pathogenic nature of the virus [12] .• vaccine development is a lengthy process, starting from product development to the competition of the phase iii clinical trial before marketing the vaccine, which can take several years, usually 10 to 20 years.• preclinical experience with other sars vaccine candidates has created red flags about worsening of the disease, which may be attributed to antibodydependent enhancement.• correlates of protection are not known.• planning and coordinating clinical trials in these emergency-like situations can be difficult, both for predicting the trial sites for outbreak as well as ensuring the site's preparedness.• in a high-mortality situation such as covid-19 pandemic, regulators may not accept conventionally designed clinical trials such as comparison with a placebo arm.• viral mutation may lead to different subtypes thus causing difficulty in vaccine design.• vaccines are generally manufactured using good manufacturing practices (gmp) to ensure that quality is controlled and consistency is maintained. for many vaccine candidates in the current pipeline for sars-cov-2, these gmp processes need to be developed, which can be time consuming.• for vaccines that will be developed with novel technologies, gmp needs to be developed from the beginning, thus adding to the financial burden and delaying the production of vaccines.• issues related to vaccine ownership, funding, pricing and supply chain, and the coordinated administration strategy can pose significant barriers.the traditional vaccine development process follows various phases such as product development, preclinical, clinical trial phases (phase i, ii, and iii) before the vaccine gets regulatory approval for marketing although phase iv and post-marketing surveillance studies are volume 57 __ may 15, 2020 ella and mohan coronavirus vaccine: light at the end of the tunnel conducted after marketing the product. this traditional approach is time consuming and not feasible to follow during the pandemic.keeping greater benefit of the vaccine for the societal need, vaccine development using pandemic approach will be the best approach for rapid development of vaccines as shown in fig. 1 . this type of innovative approach can save the time spent in pre-clinical and clinical trial phases. the regulators should consider this approach for faster approval of vaccines.vaccine development during a pandemic should be considered as a global health emergency and not as any specific disease related issue, which is a prerogative of vaccine manufacturers. public funding for vaccine development should be the top priority as any vaccine development, particularly during a pandemic can be a very risky investment, and public funding can reduce the potential risk for vaccine manufacturers, especially in the low and middle income countries.pioneering finance mechanisms such as the international finance facility for immunization (iffim) that have been successful in the past should be used to fund the development of covid-19 vaccines [10] . global alliance for vaccines and immunizations (gavi) board members also expressed support for the use of gavi's innovative financing instruments, such as its iffim and gavi's advance market commitment to accelerate vaccine development and access where needed [13] .there should be a global consensus and urgency for the development of a pandemic vaccine, at both national and international level to ensure that the vaccines are available and affordable to those who need them the most [14] .• for novel platform technologies, large-scale manufacturing can pose a significant financial risk as these facilities necessitate huge investments.• high-income countries can procure large doses of vaccine for their own population, creating disparities in the global supply and demand.• high risk populations should be identified through epidemiological and serological studies and vaccine delivery should be prioritized. this can halt the spread of the disease.• as sars-cov-2 is a newer disease without adequate exposure in the population, any new vaccine may probably necessitate more than one dose of the vaccine and protective immunity is usually achieved after the second dose. massive effort will be needed to ensure vaccine distribution and administration.• there can be a scenario, albeit low-probability, where the pandemic threat has been abruptly curtailed. in such cases, vaccine development should be continued for potential vaccine candidates to restrict future threats. the global vaccine development efforts for covid-19 pandemic are unparalleled. in the current scenario, there is an indication that vaccine could be available as early as 2021. this would be an extraordinary shift from the usual vaccine development timeframe which can range between 10-20 years. a new virus target and newer technologies can multiply the vaccine development risks, and dictates meticulous evaluation of safety and efficacy at every stage of vaccine development.robust coordination between vaccine manufacturers, regulatory authorities, public health authorities and governments is essential to make sure that potential vaccine candidates are fast-tracked for approval, manufactured and distributed seamlessly, particularly for low-income countries.considering the economic impact that covid-19 has already caused in the initial 3-4 months of this global calamity, it is worthwhile to start investing in vaccines against emerging viruses, including neglected diseases, which can potentially cause significant human deaths and also impact the global economy. global pandemics are inevitable. there should be strategically prepared protocols and emergency plans to develop vaccines in months rather than years. lessons learned in managing the covid-19 pandemic should pave the way for creating better roadmaps to face the next pandemic.the coronavirus disease 2019 begin in december 2019, like a viral outbreak in wuhan city of china [1] . it gained rapid foothold across the world resulting in who declared it as a pandemic [2] . as on april 5 th , worldwide total 1,205,825 cases and 64,978 deaths were reported by who [3] . in this period of time when the continuous transmission of the virus across borders and health burden on the global scale is rapidly increasing, more urgent studies are required and in the absence of effective cures majorly drugs, vaccination or immunization therapy is imperative in order to target whole population. likewise to move forward vaccine development pipeline, immunoinfomatics tools have been proved crucial [4] . since the covid19 has affected almost all of the world's population, promiscuous epitopes binding to a variety of hla alleles for larger dissemination is vital. for that, in silico approaches will be remarkably useful in helping develop a cure in as fast manner as possible [5] . the antibody generation by activation of b-cell as well as acute viral clearance by t-cells along with virus-specific memory generation by cd8+ t-cells are analogously important to develop immunity against the virus [6] . the s protein is considered highly antigenic and thereby can evoke strong immune responses and generate neutralizing antibodies that can block the attachment of virus to the host cells [7] .in reverse vaccinology, various tools of in silico biology are used to discover the novel antigens by studying the genetic makeup of a pathogen and the genes that could lead to good epitopes are determined. this method is a quick easy and cost-effective way to design vaccine [8] . it is a process of vaccine development where the novel antigens are identified by analyzing the genomic information of a virus or other organism. reverse vaccinology approach facilitates an easier and productive process of antigen discovery [9] .herein, we explored the proteome of sars-cov-2 of indian geographical origin against human host to identify potential antigenic proteins and epitopes that can effectively elicit cellular mediated immune response against covid-19, to do so, we collected sars-cov2 genome from indian geographical origin against human host and applied in-silico approach. this significant research disclosed two promising antigenic peptide gvyfastek and nfrvqptesiv from surface glycoproteins (protein accession no. -qia98583.1 and qhs34546.1) of sars-cov-2, they were predicted to be interacted with class i and class ii mhc alleles and displayed up to 90% conservancy and significant antigenicity. further, molecular docking analysis were confirmed the molecular interaction of such prime antigenic peptides with the residues of hla-a*11-01 allele for mhc class i and hla drb1*04-01 allele for mhc class ii. after careful evaluation, these peptides were foreseen to be appropriate epitopes proficient to elicit the strong cell-mediated immune response against the sars-cov-2. the reverse vaccinology approach facilitates an easier and productive process of vaccine candidate's determination. the outcomes from this very significant analysis could help selecting sars-cov-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines soon. this novel research will certainly pave the way for a fast, reliable and virtuous platform to provide timely countermeasure of this dangerous pandemic disease, covid-19.the highly virulent strain sars-cov-2 was chosen for in-silico analysis. the genome of viral strain is available on the national center for biotechnology information or ncbi (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with refseq nc_045512.2twelve viral protein sequences of sars-cov2 against (host: human, country: india) were retrieved from vipr database [10] .the various physicochemical properties of the protein sequences were determined by expasy's online tool protparam [11] .vaxijen v2.0 [12] was utilized to predict antigenicity of proteins. this software requires fasta-submitted amino acid sequences and uses the physicochemical properties of proteins to predict their antigenicity. this feature is denoted according to an antigenic score respectively [13].the b-cell and t-cell epitopes of the selected two surface glycoprotein sequences were predicted via iedb (the immune epitope database). the iedb database holds large amount of experimental data on epitopes and antibodies.it allows robust analysis on many epitopes in the context of some tools like: conservation across antigens, population coverage, and clusters with similar sequences [14] . in order to obtain mhc class-i restricted cd8+cytotoxic t-lymphocyte (ctl) epitopes of the selected surface glycoprotein sequences, netmhcpan el 4.0 prediction method was applied for hla-a*11-01 allele. for mhc class-ii restricted cd4+ helper t-lymphocyte (htl) epitopes were obtained for hla drb1*04-01 allele using sturniolo prediction method. top ten mhc class-i and mhc class-ii epitopes were randomly selected on the basis of their percentile scores and antigenicity scores (as). five random b-cell lymphocyte epitopes (bcl) were selected based on of their higher length using bipipered linear epitope prediction method [8] .vaxijen v2.0 was utilized to predict protein antigenicity. this software requires fasta-submitted amino acid sequences and uses the physicochemical properties of proteins to predict their antigenicity. this feature is denoted according to an antigenic score respectively [12] . the allergenicity of the selected epitopes was predicted via allertop v2 (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/).the transmembrane topology of the selected epitopes was identified using the transmembrane topology of protein helices determinant, tmhmm v2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/). the server predicts whether the epitope would be transmembrane, remain inside or outside of the membrane. the toxicity prediction of the selected epitopes was carried out via toxinpred server https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/protein.php.the conservancy analysis of the earlier selected epitopes was performed via the epitope conservancy analysis tool of iedb server [14] . during analysis, the sequence identity threshold was kept at '>=50'.cluster analysis was carried out by mhccluster 2.0 [15] . during cluster analysis, the number of peptides to be included was kept at 50,000, the number of bootstrap calculations were kept at 100. for cluster analysis, the netmhcpan-2.8 prediction method was used.the 3d structures of the selected best epitopes were generated using online 3d generating tool pep-fold3 (http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/pep-fold3/). the server is a tool for generating de novo peptide 3-dimensional structure [16] [17] [18] .pre-docking was carried out by ucsf chimera [19] . the peptide-protein docking of the selected epitopes was performed by online docking tool patchdock (https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/patchdock/php.php) results of patchdock were refined and re-scored by firedock server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/firedock/php.php). later on, docking was performed by hpepdock server [20] . docking pose analysis was done by using ligplot [21] .the sars-cov-2, strain was identified. twelve viral protein sequences of sars-cov2 against (host: human, country: india) were retrieved from vipr database and selected for the possible vaccine candidate identification ( in the physicochemical property analysis, the number of amino acids, the molecular weights, theoretical pi, extinction coefficients (in m-1 cm-1), est. half-life (in mammalian cell), instability indexes, aliphatic indexes and grand average of hydropathicity (gravy) of the twelve proteins were predicted (table-2) . for antigenicity prediction threshold value kept at 0.4, all proteins were found to be antigenic (table-3 ). the physicochemical study revealed that the surface glycoproteins qia98583.1 and qhs34546.1 had the highest extinction co-efficient of 148960m-1 cm-1 and 147470 m-1 cm-1 and lowest gravy value of -0.077 and -0.071. in addition, both surface glycoproteins were stable and antigenic. we selected both surface glycoproteins for further analysis.the t-cell epitopes of mhc class-i for both of the proteins were determined by netmhcpan el 4.0 prediction method of the iedb server keeping the sequence length 9. the server generated epitopes further analyzed on the basis of the antigenicity scores (as) and percentile scores, top ten potential epitopes were selected randomly for antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and conservancy tests. the server ranks the predicted epitopes based on the ascending order of percentile scores (table-4a & 4b) .the t-cell epitopes of mhc class-ii (hla drb1*04-01 allele) of the proteins were also determined by iedb server (table-5a & 5b) , where the sturniolo prediction methods was used. for each protein, ten of the top epitopes were selected randomly for further analysis. moreover, the b-cell epitopes of the proteins were selected using bipipered linear epitope prediction method of the iedb server and epitopes were selected based on their higher lengths (fig-1) .the topology of the selected epitopes was determined by tmhmm v2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/). table 4a and table 4b list the potential t-cell epitopes of surface glycoproteins qia98583.1, table 5a and table 5b list the potential t-cell epitopes of surface glycoproteins qhs34546.1, and table 6 list the potential b-cell epitopes with their respective topologies.in the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and conservancy analysis, the t-cell epitopes that were found to be highly antigenic as well as non-allergenic, non-toxic, and had conservancy of over 90% were selected. among the ten selected mhc class-i epitopes and ten selected mhc class-ii epitopes of both of the proteins, total four epitopes were selected based on the mentioned criteria: gvyfastek, tladagfik, nfrvqptesi and llivnnatnv.the cluster analysis of the possible mhc class-i alleles that may interact with the predicted epitopes were performed by online tool mhccluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/mhccluster/). the tool generates the clusters of the alleles in phylogenetic manner. results illustrate the outcome of the experiment where the red zone indicates strong interaction and the yellow zone corresponds to weaker interaction (fig-2) .all the t-cell epitopes were subjected to 3d structure generation by the pep-fold3 server. the 3d structures were generated for peptide-protein docking (fig-3) .the docking was performed to find out, whether all the epitopes had the ability to bind with the mhc class-i and mhc class-ii molecule. the selected epitopes were docked against the hla-a*11-01 allele (pdb id: 5wjl) andhla drb1*04-01 (pdb id: 5jlz). the docking was performed using patchdock online docking tool and then the results were refined by firedock online server. results were also analysed by hpepdock server (additional file :   fig-1) . among the four epitopes of two selected glycoproteins qia98583.1and qhs34546.1, gvyfastek (mhc class i epitope) and nfrvqptesi (mhc class ii epitope) showed the best result with the lowest global energy of -52.82 and -42.00. further, docking pose was analyzed via ligplot (fig 4) .we identified highly antigenic and non-allergenic b-cell vaccine candidates ltpgdsssgwtag and vrqiapgqtgkiad from surface glycoprotein (qia98583.1) and qiapgqtgkiad and ilpdpskpskrs from surface glycoprotein (qhs34546.1).vaccine is one of the most important and extensively produced pharmaceutical products. millions of infants and people are getting vaccinated every year. however, the development and research processes of vaccines are costly and sometimes, it takes many years to develop an appropriate vaccine candidate against a pathogen. in modern times, various tools and methods of immune-informatics, bioinformatics, and reverse vaccinology are extensively used for vaccine development, which save time and cost of the vaccine development process [8, 22] .in current study, the physicochemical study revealed that surface glycoproteins qia98583.1 and qhs34546.1 had the highest extinction co-efficient of 148960m-1 cm-1 and 147470 m-1 cm-1and lowest gravy value of -0.077 and -0.071. in addition, both surface glycoproteins were highly stable (instability index of less than 40) andantigenic. antigenicity of the proteins was determined by vaxijen v2.0 server. if a compound had instability index of more than 40, then the compound is referred to be unstable [23] . the extinction coefficient means the amount of light, that is absorbed by a compound at a certain wavelength [24, 25] . the various physicochemical properties like number of amino acids, molecular weight, theoretical pi, extinction co-efficient, instability index, aliphatic index, gravy was determined by protparam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) server. the two selected proteins performed quite similarly in the physicochemical property assessment.in immune system, two of the major cells that functions are the t lymphocytic cell and b lymphocytic cell. after [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .the possible b cell and t cell epitopes of the selected sars-cov-2 proteins were identified by the iedb (https://www.iedb.org/) server. the iedb server generates and ranks the epitopes on the basis of their antigenicity scores (as) and percentile scores. the top ten mhc class-i and mhc class-ii epitopes were taken for analysis. the topology of the selected epitopes was determined by tmhmm v2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/). in the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and conservancy analysis, the t-cell epitopes that were found to be highly antigenic as well as non-allergenic, non-toxic, and had conservancy of over 90% . among the ten selected mhc class-i epitopes and ten selected mhc class-ii epitopes of both proteins, total four epitopes were selected based on the mentioned criteria: gvyfastek, tladagfik, nfrvqptesi and llivnnatnvv as well as antigenic and non-allergenic b-cell epitopes were selected for further vaccine candidate analysis. the cluster analysis of the possible mhc class-i and mhc class-ii alleles that may interact with the predicted epitopes were performed by online tool mhc cluster 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/mhccluster/).antigenicity, defined as the ability of a foreign substance to act as antigen and activate the b cell and t cell responses, through their epitope also called antigenic determinant portion [31] . the allergenicity is defined as the ability of that substance to act as allergen and induce potential allergic reactions within the host body [32] .moreover, the cluster analysis of the mhc class-i alleles and mhc class-ii alleles were also carried out to identify their relationship with each other and cluster them functionally on the basis of their predicted binding specificity [15] . in the next step, the peptide-protein docking was carried out between the selected epitopes and the mhc alleles. the mhc class-i epitopes were docked with the mhc class-i molecule (pdb id: 5wjl) and the mhc class-ii epitopes were docked with the mhc class-ii molecule (pdb id: 5jlz) respectively. the peptideprotein docking was performed to analyze the ability of the epitopes to bind with their respective mhc molecule.pre-docking was performed by ucsf-chimera and later on, we performed 3d structure generation of the epitopes.the docking was carried out by patchdock and firedock servers also analysed by hpepdock server based on global energy. gvyfastek, and nfrvqptesi generated the best scores in the peptide-protein docking respectively. all the vaccine candidates were proved to be potentially antigenic and non-allergenic, for this reason they should not cause any allergenic reaction within the host body. however, more in vitro and in vivo researches should do to finally confirm the safety, efficacy and potentiality of the predicted vaccines candidates.in the face of the enormous tragedy of suffering, death and social disaster caused by covid-19 pandemic. it is of utmost importance to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this highly pandemic disease. bioinformatics, reverse vaccinology and related technologies are widely used in vaccine design and development since these technologies reduce the cost and time. in this study, first the potential proteins belong to sars-cov-2against (host:human, country: india) are identified. further, the potential b cell and t cell epitopes that can effectively elicit cellular mediated immune response related to these selected proteins were determined through robust processes.these potential t-cell epitopes gvyfastek, nfrvqptesi and b-cell epitopes ltpgdsssgwtag, vrqiapgqtgkiad, qiapgqtgkiad and ilpdpskpskrs play vital role in subunit and multi-epitope vaccine construction in the near future. to conclude, reverse vaccinology justified as a powerful tool for identifying new vaccine candidates and their consequent precise application. this study will lead the research in a new and effectual direction and the outcome of our study will provide a fast, reliable and significant platform in search of effective and timely cure of this dangerous pandemic disease, covid-19 caused by sars-cov2. the recent emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) highlights the need to engineer new methods for expediting vaccine development against emerging diseases. however, several obstacles prevent pursuit of a licensable mers vaccine. first, the lack of a suitable animal model for mers complicates the in vivo testing of candidate vaccines. second, due to the low number of mers cases, pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to pursue mers vaccine production as the costs of clinical trials are high. in addition, the timeline from bench research to approved vaccine use is 10 years or longer. using novel methods and cost-saving strategies, genetically engineered vaccines can be produced quickly and cost-effectively. along with progress in mers animal model development, these obstacles can be circumvented or at least mitigated. keywords high-consequence pathogens continue to emerge or re-emerge globally, leading to increased public health concerns about potential pandemics [1] . current human viral disease outbreaks of concern include an ongoing ebola virus disease epidemic in west africa [2] , avian influenza caused by a novel influenza a virus subtype (h7n9) in china [3] , enterovirus d68 infections in the usa [4] and the topic of this review, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) caused by middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) (2012present) [5] . emerging infections often first present as limited disease outbreaks caused by rare or unknown pathogens, increasing the likelihood that their significance is overlooked. consequently, financial resources are routed toward other infectious diseases that are deemed more 'pressing' at a given time. examples of rare agents that caused very few human infections for many years, only to then erupt in outbreaks involving thousands are: rift valley fever virus (more than 100,000 cases from 1930 to 2015) [6] and ebola virus (1581 cases and 1136 deaths since its discovery in 1976 until late 2013; 24,701 cases and 10,194 deaths from december 2013 to march 18, 2015) [2] . other agents, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), emerge unexpectedly and eventually cause large epidemics (8096 cases and 774 deaths), only to seemingly disappear again [7] . consequently, global public health professionals are challenged with the ever more important task of rapidly developing improved methods for infectious disease detection, surveillance, control, prevention and containment.through widespread efforts to provide a swift response to an emerging disease, mers, an impressive spectrum of prevention and treatment strategies was established in vitro in a relatively short period of time. from antivirals to monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and vaccines [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing led us to the same predicament that the scientific community faced during the sars epidemic. laboratory research is all too often inefficiently translated into clinical testing of candidate therapeutics and prophylactics, delaying clinical licensure by the authorities and final administration during outbreaks. here we summarize and evaluate the progress made in mers vaccine development to provide an example of various challenges that are encountered on the path to medical countermeasure licensure.epidemiology of mers mers was first recognized as a new disease in a 60-year-old saudi male patient with respiratory distress admitted to a hospital in jeddah, saudi arabia in june 2012 [19] . soon after the index case was detected, more and more people were identified who suffered of the same ailment [20, 21] . the majority of mers infections were reported from western asia (in particular from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates, but also from jordan, lebanon, kuwait, oman, qatar and yemen). later, mers was also diagnosed in europe (austria, france, germany, greece, italy, the netherlands, uk), northern africa (algeria, egypt, tunisia), northern america (usa), southeastern asia (malaysia, philippines) and southern asia (iran) among people with a travel history to western asia [5] .human-to-human transmission of mers-cov is estimated to account for approximately 60% of the total mers cases [22] , and the origin of infection with mers-cov is unexplained in the rest of the cases. the risk of virus transmission is substantially greater from index cases than from secondary cases [22] . the increasing distribution of mers cases within the arabian peninsula is worrisome. for instance, for the past 2 years, concerns about the initiation of a mers pandemic prompted travel restrictions to makkah, saudi arabia, for millions of muslim pilgrims, preventing tens of thousands of potential travelers from making the religiously significant hajj journey. although a major outbreak of mers has not occurred as a direct result of recent hajjes, trepidations remained high [23, 24] .studies revealed that older men and individuals with comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes; hypertension; chronic cardiac, lung or renal disease) are at greatest risk for developing fatal mers, although the gender bias is epidemiologically unclear [20, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . whether physiological, genetic or cultural factors play a role in the increased risk toward men is unknown. at the time of writing, 1075 mers cases were confirmed, including at least 404 deaths [5] . however, increasing evidence of subclinical infections [30] suggests that the actual number of human mers cases is much higher than the currently confirmed number. the etiological agent of mers, a novel betacoronavirus, was rapidly identified and named 'middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov)' [19, 31, 32 ].how mers-cov was originally introduced into the human population and why mers cases were not recorded before 2012 remain to be determined. one-humped camels (camelus dromedarius) are currently suspected to be the animals from which mers-cov is transmitted to humans. this suspicion stems from the detection of mers-cov-neutralizing antibodies in one-humped camel herds of egypt [ and united arab emirates [41, 42] . mers-cov or mers-covlike genome fragments and coding-complete genomes, highly similar to human mers-cov genomes, were detected in one-humped camels [38, 39, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] , and mers-cov was directly isolated from several one-humped camels and grown in tissue culture [39, 49, 50] . one-humped camels experimentally infected with mers-cov develop only minor clinical signs of respiratory disease, but mers-cov replicates in the upper airways [51] . serologic evidence for mers-cov infection was not found in people with potential exposure to infected one-humped camels in three serosurveys [39, 52, 53] . therefore, zoonotic transmission from one-humped camels to people might be a rare event.however, such a conclusion should be regarded with caution until further serosurveys are performed and published. it is, therefore, possible that mers-cov is widely distributed among one-humped camels, but that particular genotype of the virus had to evolve to allow a jump into the human population. a genomic study, indeed, revealed the presence of several genetic variants of mers-cov in individual one-humped camels, whereas mers-cov in humans exposed to these onehumped camels appears to be infected with clonal mers-cov populations [44] . as one-humped camels are frequently exported from africa to the arabian peninsula of western asia, an animal native to africa could be transmitting mers-cov to onehumped camels prior to exportation (figure 1).based on the presence of genome fragments, genomes or replicating viruses, many betacoronaviruses seem to be maintained in africa, europe and asia by phylogenetically highly diverse bats. these viruses include sars-cov and sars-cov-related viruses from horseshoe bats (rhinolophus spp.) [54] , but several viruses even more closely related to mers-cov have not been detected in humans [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . therefore, researchers speculate that mers-cov could be a bat-borne virus. the batorigin hypothesis is based on betacoronavirus phylogeny and receptor usage [55, 56, [64] [65] [66] [67] and isolation of mers-cov from one individual egyptian tomb bat (taphozous perforatus) [66] . however, these studies are suggestive and epidemiological evidence of bat-to-human or bat-to-one-humped camel transmission of mers-cov (figure 1a ) has yet to be gathered [68] .after an incubation period of 9-12 days, mers generally presents in humans as a lower respiratory infection with fever (often with chills or rigors), dry or productive cough and dyspnea. more infrequently, patients develop chest pain, headaches, hemoptysis, myalgia and/or sore throat. in severe cases, the illness can quickly progress to severe atypical pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe hypoxemic respiratory failure [20, 26, 28, 29, 69] . mers often includes extrapulmonary manifestations involving the circulatory, renal and/or gastrointestinal systems (abdominal pain/nausea, diarrhea, emesis) that can rapidly advance to septic shock, renal failure or refractory multiple organ failure [20, 28, 70] . chest x-ray or computed tomography imaging often reveals subtle to extensive unilateral or bilateral abnormalities, such as consolidation, increased bronchovascular markings, pleural or bronchial wall thickening, reticulonodular airspace opacities or cardiomegaly. clinical chemistry is characterized by increased alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase concentrations in some patients and increased l-lactate dehydrogenase concentration in about 50% of the cases. low albumin and hemoglobin concentrations are frequent findings, as are lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, whereas lymphocytosis occurs more rarely [20, 26, 28, 29, 69] . viral loads are usually high in the respiratory tract (reaching >10 6 genome copies/ml) but may be low or absent in the blood [28, 69, 70] .at the moment, specific antiviral agents for the treatment of mers are not available. however, several in vitro studies identified drugs already in clinical use that potentially could be repurposed for treatment of mers. these drugs include an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor (mycophenolic acid) used to treat other coronavirus infections [13,15,16]; a pan-coronavirus inhibitor that targets membrane-bound coronaviral rna synthesis (k22) [71] ; the guanosine analog ribavirin used in the treatment of hepatitis c, respiratory syncytial virus and arenavirus infections; interferon-b [13, 16, 72] ; inhibitors of estrogen receptor 1 used for cancer treatment (toremifene citrate); inhibitors of dopamine receptors used as antipsychotics (chlorpromazine hydrochloride and triflupromazine hydrochloride); kinase signaling inhibitors (imatinib mesylate and dasatinib) [12] ; endocytosis inhibitors (chlorpromazine and chloroquine) [18] ; an antidiarrheal agent (loperamide); the hiv-1 protease inhibitor lopinavir [18] ; and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 protease inhibitor camostat [73] . unfortunately, few of these drugs have been evaluated in animal models of mers (an exception is [72] ), which, in part, is due to the absence of animal models that truly reflect the human disease (see below).in the absence of approved specific antiviral agents against mers-cov, treatment, therefore, is based on supportive care. after initial laboratory blood tests and chest radiography, patients are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to control (often nosocomial) secondary bacterial infections. however, the majority of in-patient mers cases escalate to respiratory failure, requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or renal replacement therapy and, therefore, admission to an intensive care unit [20, 26, 28, 29, 69] .potential costs associated with mers treatment and disease management for mers can be a tremendous financial burden to local economies. in the event of a pandemic, the financial burden may prove to be catastrophic, especially in countries with limited financial resources. based on the small number of treatment-cost analyses available from the 2003 outbreak of sars [74, 75] , at tourcoing hospital, france, additional hospital administration and material resource costs alone approximated us$79,150 per in-patient due to the need for increases in staff, containment apparatuses and personal protective equipment required when dealing with a highconsequence pathogen. moreover, the average mers in-patient incurs the added costs of a prolonged intensive care unit stay (94.5% of cases) with mechanical ventilation (86% of cases) and renal replacement therapy (50% of cases) (figure 2).the world bank estimates global economic losses of trillions of us dollars in the event of a severe influenza pandemic and considers mers to be a pathogen of pandemic potential [14] . global costs for the 2003 sars epidemic alone were estimated at us$40 billion [76] . the cost of developing a successful vaccine is approaching us$500 million. an effective vaccine for a high-consequence pathogen has the potential to save 10 times its cost in a single year of use, as estimated for the smallpox vaccine. however, a true cost-to-benefit analysis must be performed to determine if vaccine development efforts will provide benefit. if we assume that mers cases continue at the rate of roughly 450 per year with a 62% hospitalization rate [77] and that the additional cost per in-patient is approximately us$714,000 on average (cumulative average cost per day per intervention per in-patient multiplied by median stay per respective intervention), the cost of developing the vaccine would be justified within 2.5 years (figure 2) . therefore, if sustained human-to-human mers-cov transmission were to occur, the benefit would outweigh the cost. in general, vaccine development is a worthwhile pursuit, and steps should be taken to expedite approval of safe and effective vaccines for emerging pathogens. similar to many other coronaviruses, the major structural proteins, spike protein (s), envelope protein (e), membrane protein (m) and nucleoprotein (n), are the primary targets of the host antibody-mediated immune response and are the focus in vaccine development efforts. s is the surface glycoprotein of the mers coronavirion. s mediates the attachment of the virion to target cells and its subsequent entry into the cell by fusing viral and host cell membranes [79] . these functions involve two distinct domains of s, referred to as s1 and s2, respectively. s1 contains the host cell receptor-binding domain [42, 80, 81] , which engages the primary mers-cov cell-surface receptor cd26/dpp4 [11] . s2 contains epitopes that are crossreactive with homologous epitopes of other group a and b betacoronaviruses [79, 82] , suggesting that the development of a general, multivalent, betacoronavirus vaccine might be possible. the e and the m work to secure the structural integrity of the virion. the nucleoprotein (n) encapsidates the viral genomic rna [83] .the identification of the natural host reservoir of an emerging human pathogen is the first ideal step toward prevention of transmission. then, the human population could be educated to avoid the host or to implement proper safety measures when coming in contact with the reservoir. if contact with the reservoir host cannot be avoided (e.g., abundance, economic importance), vaccination of such a host may be a straightforward approach to prevent host-tohuman transmission. in addition, the development of an animal vaccine may ultimately be cheaper to produce and faster to achieve as regulatory hurdles to obtain licensure may not be as stringent as those in place for human vaccine development. for example, vaccination of wildlife reservoirs against rabies reduced human cases in the usa by 98% [84] . this strategy is also a relatively new pursuit for the eradication of tuberculosis in parts of europe through vaccination of cattle and wildlife [85, 86] .unfortunately, as described above, the natural mers-cov reservoir and the mers-cov transmission cycle remain to be defined. vaccination of one-humped camel herds could be feasible as these animals are often kept/raised/sold by humans, and wild animals could be identified relatively easily. however, some adult one-humped camels tested positive for mers-cov despite the presence of anti-mers-cov antibodies [38, 39] , and pre-existing neutralizing anti-mers-cov antibodies do not necessarily protect against re-infection with mers-cov [39] . this observation suggests that camel vaccination may have to review papaneri, johnson, wada, bollinger, jahrling & kuhn be repeated regularly or may not be effective at all. probably even more unrealistic is the vaccination of bats due to sheer number of these relatively small and (dependent on species) often quite abundant animals. the absence of a clearly defined zoonotic virus ecology prompts researchers to contemplate development of human vaccines. as mers tends to be acute and is not yet widespread, targeting specific human populations at high risk of infection for vaccination is a logical strategy for prevention or limitation of infections. development and distribution of vaccines should, therefore, be expedited for one-humped camel handlers and herders, healthcare workers and veterinarians, and travelers to areas where mers-cov infection is prevalent. if widespread infection throughout the general population is expected, other high-risk populations (e.g., aged people, persons with cormorbidities) should be targeted for vaccination.given the lack of a suitable mers animal model and relatively few clinical data on mers-cov patients, the nature of a successful immune response to mers-cov infection is difficult to establish. serology and pcr-based assays indicate that many . adenovirus 5 vector expressing s or s1 [116] . rbd fused with igg-fc fragment [40, 42, 80, 81, 143] 3 3 accessory structuralunknown, but not essential for replication [101] 4a 4a accessory structural . unknown, but not essential for replication [101] . interferon antagonist [144, 145] 4b 4b accessory structural. unknown, but not essential for replication [101] . interferon antagonist [144] 5 5 accessory structural . unknown, but not essential for replication [101, 142] . interferon antagonist [144] e envelope protein major structuralstructural integrity of the virion; required for propagation [101] recombinant [88] . the experiment was based on bronchoalveolar lavages obtained from two patients and identified that the one who succumbed to mers did not develop a th1 response. this patient had lower concentrations of interferon-a, interleukin-12 and interferon-g, compared to the patient who did not succumb. although the experiment involved a limited sample size, the data support the necessity of a th1 response. zhao et al. investigated knockout mice to evaluate the immunological requirements of clearance of mers-cov [89] . the authors demonstrated that interferon-a-and myd88-deficient mice could not clear mers-cov as rapidly as wild-type mice. similarly, t-cell and b-cell knockout mice could not clear the virus as efficiently as control mice. furthermore, vaccinated mice had reduced viral titers, and serum transfer experiments provided protection against homologous mers-cov infection. these data suggest that both an efficient t-and b-cell response are required for protection. indirect or direct b-and t-cell functional response should be included as criteria for candidate vaccine evaluation. until more clinical data become available, correlates of protection will be difficult to establish.vaccine design strategies applicable to mers historically, the first vaccines against viral pathogens were homotypic live-attenuated viruses. the virus isolate was passaged in an animal host or cell line until a nonvirulent (live-attenuated) strain evolved, and this nonvirulent virus was then used for vaccination [90] . a more recent method for developing vaccines is to genetically engineer the virus to be avirulent or replication incompetent [91, 92] . replication-deficient vaccine virus constructs were generated that expressed human parainfluenza virus-3 or human respiratory syncytial virus [93, 94] . similarly, replicationdeficient adenoviruses were developed as vaccines against ebola virus and hiv-1 infection [95, 96] . a phase iia clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy of a replicating modified vaccinia ankara (mva) expressing influenza a virus proteins [97] . replicating mva has also been used to boost the effect of replication-deficient adenovirus-based vaccine responses [98] .the main concern with replicating (live) viral vaccines is the possibility of disseminated infection in immunosuppressed populations (e.g., disseminated vaccinia virus infection) with heterotypic vaccine platforms or the possibility of reversion to virulence in the case of homotypic candidates [99] . new methods of replicating vaccine development typically incorporate fail-safe mechanisms. such mechanisms include deletion of a gene encoding a protein required for viral propagation or introduction of a sufficient number of genomic mutations to make reversion extremely unlikely [91, 100] . for instance, almazan et al. engineered a recombinant mers-cov lacking the e open reading frame as a mers candidate vaccine; however, its protective efficacy has not yet been demonstrated [101] .whole inactivated virion preparations often provide the immunogenicity of a replicating viral vaccine without the possibility of reversion to a virulent phenotype. virions are killed or inactivated by chemical or radiological methods prior to use in a vaccine. while the preparation is not able to replicate in the host, the recipient's immune system still mounts a response against the presented antigens. although examples of inactivated mers-cov virions are not yet published, inactivated sars-cov particle vaccines have been tested with minimal success in laboratory mice and domestic ferrets [102] [103] [104] .use of inactivated virion preparations has prompted several concerns. one concern is that toxic reagents used in virion inactivation must be completely removed from the product before administration. another concern is that irradiation, used as an alternative to toxic agents, may destroy crucial epitopes and, therefore, render the preparation nonimmunogenic. the third concern is that inactivation could be, for whatever reason, incomplete, resulting in preparations containing fully virulent viruses. these concerns are exacerbated by the increasing stigma that exists among the general public regarding vaccines, in general, and chemical additives in vaccine preparations, in particular [105, 106] .recombinant viral vectors are an upgrade to the replicating viral vaccine strategy. the ability to optimize for safety and immunogenicity via bioengineering is an obvious benefit. using vaccine platforms such as adenoviruses [107] , vesiculoviruses [108] or mva [109] [110] [111] [112] , the foreign gene of immunological interest can be inserted into a heterotypic viral genome with proven success as a vaccine. the recombinant virus will express the foreign protein, which will stimulate a protective immune response in the inoculated host. this approach has also been used successfully to develop multivalent vaccines. such vaccines can confer protection against not only multiple variants or strains of the same pathogen but also multiple pathogens simultaneously [98, [113] [114] [115] . recently, escriou et al. showed evidence of bivalent protection of laboratory mice from measles virus and sars-cov infection [115] . for such constructs, codon optimization for host recognition may increase attenuation and protein expression, yielding greater safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine. for instance, two vaccines, an mva vaccine and an adenovirus-based vaccine, expressing codon-optimized mers-cov s elicited serum antibodies in laboratory mice that were used to neutralize mers-cov in vitro [111, 116] .as an alternative method to immunogen presentation by a viral vector, nanoparticles of the protein of interest can be formulated with a suitable adjuvant for use as a candidate vaccine. for instance, micellular nanoparticles with mers-cov s trimers expressed on the surface (novavax, inc., gaithersburg, md, usa) were concentrated from preparations of a recombinant baculovirus (autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus [acmnpv]) expressing mers-cov s. the acmnpv genes were codon-optimized for expression in the insect cells in which the virus was propagated [117] . again, mers-cov-neutralizing antibodies were induced in immunized laboratory mice.dna vaccines typically consist of a viral genomic segment encoding a neutralizing epitope contained in a plasmid and combined with an adjuvant for administration [118] . while early fabrications failed to yield protective immune responses, more recent studies testing dna vaccines corrected this shortcoming by optimizing constituents and delivery methods. also, due to the relatively simple and low-cost processes for production and manufacturing, dna vaccines are a competitive pursuit. one such dna vaccine, a quadrivalent vaccine against hpv infection caused by types 6, 11, 16 and 18, is widely used in vaccination programs in numerous countries [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] . unpublished data from inovio pharmaceuticals suggest strong neutralizing antibody elicitation, possible multiple strain coverage and broad cd8 + t-cell responses in mice after immunization with a mers-cov dna vaccine. inovio's proprietary technology involves using the syncon dna vaccine platform. inovio's proprietary technology involves using the syncon dna vaccine platform. this platform incorporates dna from multiple strains and/or antigens. the dna is transfected by electroporation, resulting in a more efficient delivery into muscle or skin cells [124] .other novel vaccine development strategies of interest use immunoinformatics to predict the most immunogenic parts of a virus that should be included in a vaccine to achieve the most potent and relevant neutralization. the resulting candidate vaccines are also known as subunit vaccines. current mers candidate vaccines focus on the receptor-binding domain of s1 as a precise source from which the adaptive immune response would generate effective neutralizing antibodies [40, 42, 81 ]. using immunoinformatics, sharmin and islam chose to focus on an epitope found in rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) that is conserved across all human coronaviruses [125] . while blocking viral replication by affecting the rdrp may be effective in vitro, this method has yet to be proven effective in protecting a host from infection by an rna virus. one drawback to this approach is that the rdrp epitopes may not be readily detected by the host immune system as the rdrp is usually not a major structural component of virions. also, antigenic processing should lead to a wide range of t-cell and b-cell immunoreactive epitopes. therefore, focusing on rdrp epitopes would not provide broad, effective cellular and humoral responses.in combination with the aforementioned immunoinformatics technology, a more realistic approach is based on the use of b-cell and t-cell epitope predictions based on viral genome sequence. neutralizing antibodies to mers-cov structural proteins, primarily s, are believed to be required to inhibit infection [81, 111, 116, 117] . in addition to humoral immunity, t-cell responses are now considered to be a major determinant of protection from infectious diseases [126, 127] . such an approach using b-cell and t-cell epitopes was used by researchers such as terry et al. and oany et al. to develop a mers candidate vaccine [128, 129] . while this approach is innovative, no actual in vivo mers-cov neutralization has been demonstrated to date.the evaluation of any candidate vaccine against a highconsequence viral disease is critically dependent on the availability of animal models. the us fda 'animal rule' permits use of efficacy data from animal models that closely mimic human disease for approval of medical countermeasures, when evaluation in humans is not ethically feasible due to the high lethality of the virus under evaluation [130] . to the best of our knowledge, the fda has not determined that mers medical countermeasure development falls under the animal rule. however, the identification and development of a suitable animal model for any human disease has many challenges and caveats. upon exposure to mers-cov, animals should display respiratory distress, fever, tussis, dyspnea, gastrointestinal signs such as vomiting and diarrhea, and renal failure [20, 26, 29] .since mers-cov was first identified, several groups have attempted to develop such mers animal models. laboratory mice, syrian hamsters (mesocricetus auratus) and domestic ferrets (mustela putorius furo) were evaluated as potential models for medical countermeasure screening and for understanding mers-cov-induced pathogenic mechanisms [117, 131] . initial experiments included screening of wild-type balb/c and stat-1 knockout laboratory mice for susceptibility to mers-cov infection and development of disease. however, the mice did not develop clinical signs of disease, and infectious virus could not be recovered [117] . zhao et al. overcame this hurdle by transducing balb/c mice with human cd26/dpp4 using an adenovirus construct [89] . transduced mice were permissive to mers-cov infection and demonstrated minimal weight loss. however, candidate medical countermeasures in this mouse model can only be evaluated by comparing the changes in viral titer in the lungs at 4 days post-inoculation between treated and untreated animals. transduction-based models may also prove quite variable due to infection efficacy of the transducing vector.nonhuman primates, such as rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta), crab-eating macaques (macaca fascicularis), grivets (chlorocebus aethiops) or common marmosets (callithrix jacchus), are frequently used in the development of animal models for human viral disease because of their immunological similarity to humans. mers-cov inoculation into rhesus monkeys gave varied results, leading to disease with limited similarity to human disease [72, 132, 133] for instance, a study by yao et al. revealed that intratracheal inoculation of rhesus monkeys with mers-cov resulted in a nonlethal disease, and some limited pathology could be observed at 28 days post-inoculation [133] . de wit et al. described a study of nonhuman primates following inoculation with a combination of intratracheal, intranasal, oral and conjunctival routes [132] . rhesus monkeys were euthanized on days 3 and 6 post-inoculation with mers-cov and evaluated for virological, immunological and histopathological changes [132, 134] . at the euthanasia time points, the animals had signs of pneumonia, and replicating virus could be demonstrated in tissues and mucous membranes by quantitative pcr. however, inherent in the serialsampling design, the disease progression induced by viral infection was truncated, limiting the data gleaned from the study.middle east respiratory syndrome review informahealthcare.com a follow-up study by falzarano et al. demonstrated that administration of anti-inflammatory immunomodulators, interferon-a2b and ribavirin, reduced the viral burden and lessened disease severity following intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular challenge with mers-cov [72] . x-ray radiographs indicated lung infiltrates at days 3 and 5 post-inoculation, suggesting virusinduced lung disease. however, these two studies did not include mock-inoculated controls to demonstrate that the observed clinical signs were not due to generalized inflammation from inoculation and handling procedures. more recently, falzarano et al. described intratracheal inoculation of common marmosets with mers-cov, which resulted in partially lethal disease [135] . however, the animals received a large volume bolus of mers-cov (0.5 ml) intratracheally, which was disproportionate based on the small lung volume (15-25 ml) of a common marmoset [johnson rf, unpublished observation measured by computed tomography (n = 10)]. in addition, the experiment did not include animals that only received control inocula. therefore, the extent of virus-induced pathology compared to pathology due to animal manipulation remains unclear. overall, a suitable nonhuman primate model of human mers is still lacking.if one-humped camels are the reservoir of mers-cov (see above), then their vaccination against mers-cov infection may provide an intervention opportunity (figure 1b) . indeed, three one-humped camels, inoculated by intranasal, intratracheal and conjunctival routes with mers-cov developed benign clinical signs, but shed large quantities of the virus from the upper respiratory tract [51] . comparisons drawn from a uniformly lethal animal model against this one-humped camel model would be interesting.a mers animal model based on one-humped camels has many challenges. the large size of these animals, their relative scarcity in the western world and the classification of mers-cov as a who risk group 3 pathogen (requiring biosafety level 3 [bsl-3] containment) limit the number of facilities that could perform such studies. colorado state university, kansas state university, united states department of agriculture (ames, ia, usa) and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation (commonly known as csiro, clayton south, australia) all have bsl-3 labs that could handle such large animals. an alternative is the use of other camelids, such as alpacas (vicugna pacos), guanacos (lama guanicoe), llamas (llama glama) or vicuñas (vicugna vicugna), as these camelids are smaller and may be easier to obtain than bactrian camels (camelus bactrianus). such camels are as big as one-humped camels and rarer). however, the consequence of mers-cov inoculation in these animals requires evaluation.the recent emergence of mers-cov and the re-emergence of several other high-consequence pathogens in recent years have spurred a retooling of current vaccine strategies and development procedures. many current mers vaccine development strategies are based on sars research [136] . however, in the 11 years since the first description of sars, no vaccine to prevent sars-cov infection has been approved. this fact does not bode well for researchers and clinicians. while researchers are not deficient in mers candidate vaccines, more emphasis should be placed on improving translational research, licensure procedures and animal model development for emerging pathogens [89, 133] .for transient outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as mers, that appear to subside relatively quickly on their own, justification of funding and research efforts for vaccine development is figure 3 . idealized vaccine development timeline from post-discovery to pre-regulatory submission. a simplified timeline illustrates the potential pitfalls encountered throughout the development process. optimistic estimates for vaccine development from candidate selection to industrial production fall between 3.5 and 4 years, depending on the type of vaccine. after adding 2-3 years for research prior to candidate selection and 2-3 years for regulatory submission and licensure once a final formulation is in hand, total time is approximately 10 years. as discovery methods and bureaucratic processes and approvals are accelerating, the overall timeline could realistically shrink to 6-7 years.not always straightforward. unfortunately, vaccine development often seems reactionary rather than prospective. for instance, vaccine development against ebola virus disease was overall a niche activity until the current 2013-2015 outbreak affected thousands of people. for any rare or emerging pathogen, costbenefit analyses for vaccine development must be calculated based on a limited knowledge of its pandemic and/or re-emergence potential. as the example of mers-cov shows, even with sparse economical data available, cost estimates as shown in figure 2 warrant mers vaccine development, as economic losses from even small infectious disease outbreaks far outweigh the costs associated with vaccine development. however, faster methods to move a candidate vaccine from the laboratory bench into the clinic are essential. such on-demand acceleration strategies are in current evaluation, and support for these efforts should be advanced [137] [138] [139] . . the prediction of clinical trial success based on in vitro research results remains a major obstacle to timely vaccine development, particularly for vaccines against emerging diseases with high lethality as seen with mers.. emerging pathogen control via accelerated on-demand vaccine development is an idealistic approach.. the usual lag in disease identification from accurate clinical reporting of presentation and pathogenesis should be shortened, and the difficulties related to regulatory submission and licensure for vaccines should be addressed before on-demand methods can be practically implemented.. thus far, the most promising mers vaccine candidates are those that are proven to elicit mers coronavirus (mers-cov)-neutralizing antibodies and that use an approved platform for administration. these include vaccines by novavax (mers-cov s nanoparticles) andinovio pharmaceuticals (dna mers vaccine targeting multiple antigens). mers vaccines that focus on targeting the mers-cov receptorbinding domain also look promising. new and emerging infectious diseases continue to plague the world, and there is significant concern that recombinant infectious agents can be used as bioterrorism threats. microbiologists are increasingly being asked to apply their scientific knowledge to respond to these threats. the recent pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus illustrated not only how a newly evolved pathogen can rapidly spread throughout the world but also how the global community can unite to identify the causative agent and control its spread. rapid response research mechanisms, such as those used by the sars accelerated vaccine initiative (savi), have shown that the application of emergency management techniques, together with rapid response research, can be highly effective when applied appropriately to new infectious diseases.throughout human history, infectious diseases have had an important role in shaping and evolving our world. pandemics and epidemics have been commonplace as the density of the world's population and international travel and trade have increased to support the global spread of pathogens. microbial pathogens are constantly evolving, and new pathogens are continually emerging from nature. the recent emergence of many new pathogens, including hiv, enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, west nile virus, legionella pneumophila, cryptococcus neoformans subspecies gattii and various influenza a strains, is actually biology taking its normal course, as microorganisms evolve to exploit new or altered ecological niches 1, 2 . therefore, it is no surprise that the first pandemic of the twenty-first century appeared quickly, late in 2002, with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) causing significant morbidity (approximately 8,500 cases) and mortality (774 deaths), and had an estimated economic impact of us $90 billion worldwide 3 .the sars outbreak provided an excellent opportunity to attempt to harness the power of modern science to provide rapid solutions to a public health emergency and placed pressure on many microbiologists worldwide to identify and sequence the virus, characterize the disease, apply modern epidemiological techniques to track and trace the virus and its origins, and develop strategies to treat and control the pathogen. worldwide, scientists responded to these challenges with extreme vigour, and many achievements were made (fig. 1) , including identifying the causative agent, sequencing its genome, developing animal models of infection and determining where the pathogen originated in nature and how it was globally spread in human communities. however, despite the acquisition of this large body of scientific information, as sars was spreading around the world a method of controlling the virus was required in case it escaped containment measures. this meant that alternative therapeutic and preventative methods were urgently needed.the development of vaccines and other therapeutic agents usually takes at least a decade and costs hundreds of millions of dollars, yet a practical solution for sars was needed before the beginning of the next respiratory virus season. in addition, other new microbial threats are likely to emerge, and scientists will again be asked to provide rapid solutions. so, a fast and successful response to sars could provide an example of how science can be effectively applied in response to other new and emerging diseases.unfortunately, the usual scientific process is not designed to be focused on quickly solving a practical problem. grant applications, peer review and funding mechanisms are traditionally not rapid processes. responding to emerging infectious diseases of pressing public health importance requires a scientific process that is significantly different from traditional procedures. such a response must focus the science directly on a practical solution to the problem, and solve several scientific problems in parallel instead of in sequence. the sars pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to attempt to develop such a system. clinical trials, regulatory affairs and international collaborations were all developed in parallel instead of sequentially. as soon as the genome became available, a bioinformatics web site was created, which was used by savi scientists as well as many other sars researchers around the world (see sars bioinformatics suite in the online links box). in addition, there was a large demand worldwide for full-length sequenced clones of the various sars coronavirus genes. several programmes were put in place to clone and express viral proteins that could be used both as reagents and in vaccine studies. methods were developed for growing the virus in tissue culture (using vero cells), and a neutralization assay was developed, both of which were necessary for vaccine development.an important factor in producing a vaccine quickly is the early availability of information about the basis for immunological protection against disease. although the immune correlates for protection against sars-cov are not yet completely defined, individuals convalescing from sars are known to develop high titres of neutralizing antibodies 8 . the appearance of these neutralizing antibodies coincided with the onset of resolution of sars pneumonia 9,10 and, as with other coronaviruses 11 , there is an inverse relationship between disease severity and the levels of pre-existing serum antibodies. so, neutralizing antibodies are likely to be important in protection against sars. t-cell immunity is also likely to be necessary for protection from sars, as it is for many other viruses. for instance, low concentrations of cd4 + and cd8 + t cells during a sars infection are correlated with increased disease severity and mortality 12 , and specific human leukocyte antigen (hla) class i alleles have been correlated with sars susceptibility 13 . taken together, the data indicated that a vaccine for sars would need to induce neutralizing antibodies and, possibly, cd4 + and cd8 + t-cell responses. this knowledge proved helpful in selecting vaccine candidates and immunization approaches.there are many potential vaccine strategies that can be considered for the sars-cov, including a whole killed viral vaccine, an attenuated virus, such as adenovirus or vaccinia virus, expressing sars proteins, recombinant sars proteins or dna vaccines. successful vaccines have been developed for animal coronaviruses, indicating that one or more of these strategies might work. information about which sars proteins could be used as candidate vaccine antigens was also obtained from the development of other animal coronavirus vaccines 14 . thesewith the emergence of sars, many scientific groups worldwide began to study the disease. canada was particularly affected by sarsthere were 438 cases, 44 deaths and a world health organization (who) travel health advisory was issued -and therefore had a strong interest in the pandemic 3, 4 . the michael smith genome sciences centre in vancouver had an emergency management plan in place that allowed the entire facility to be dedicated to the rapid sequencing of an infectious agent. in collaboration with the british columbia centre for disease control and health, which supplied the sars clinical virus strain (known as toronto 2 or tor-2), this centre generated the first genome sequence of the sars-cov within six days of receiving the viral nucleic acid 5 . several other groups followed with other genome sequences shortly thereafter 6, 7 .the key to sequencing the genome so quickly was having a rapid response emergency management plan already in place. this entailed a top-down management approach to be taken, with team members in parallel projects able to dedicate their time and expertise to their assigned tasks. this success, coupled with the concern that, in canada, quarantine would not contain the sars-cov, led to the provincial british columbia government providing cdn $2.6 million in april 2003 to establish the sars accelerated vaccine initiative (savi) that was dedicated to developing a human sars vaccine as rapidly as possible. a vaccine approach was chosen for several reasons, including previous success with animal coronavirus vaccines, the ease of product development and the use of vaccines to prevent infection in cases of defined risk exposure (such as healthcare workers in hospitals).savi was established to apply rapid response research to a public health issue. it was designed with only one goal -to develop a safe and effective human sars vaccine as rapidly as possible. all savi-funded vaccine-development initiatives were evaluated with this goal in mind. a senior management committee was established that had significant expertise in animal coronavirus vaccines and epidemiology, clinical trials and grant-funding mechanisms. an emergency management strategy was adopted, with weekly teleconferences between all members, as well as regular management committee discussions. parallel research strategies were designed, with vaccine development as the ultimate goal. so, in addition to identifying vaccine candidates, immunological assays, intellectual property. to successfully commercialize a vaccine, a strong intellectual property position is needed 25 . savi was fortunate in that it is partnered with the group that sequenced the sars-cov, and they protected the genome sequence 5 . however, additional intellectual property issues will arise as the project progresses, and there will also be preexisting intellectual property in place that must be incorporated, such as the use of live attenuated vectors or protein expression systems. savi decided to not make itself a legal entity, but to leave the ownership of intellectual property with the inventors and their home universities. this saved significant time, as intellectual property mechanisms are already established at the various partner universities, and issues such as royalty rates are already settled. an appropriate way to deal with intellectual property remains a significant challenge worldwide for the development and commercialization of sars vaccines.regulatory issues. regulatory issues are another consideration when rapidly developing a vaccine. vaccines often take many years to develop, yet the need for a sars vaccine was urgent. so, at the beginning of the initiative, discussions were held with the appropriate regulatory bodies (health canada and the us fda) to gain their support and obtain documents describing regulatory guidelines for biological agents. in addition, savi worked with regulatory authorities and consultants to define the steps that were needed for vaccine development, including the use of clinically approved cell lines for vaccine generation, avoidance of animal products for vaccine production, identification of plasmids another important consideration in vaccine testing is the availability of a relevant animal infection and challenge model. when the vaccine studies were initiated, there were no animal models available, but it was assumed that they would be developed quickly. as rapid vaccine development was the ultimate goal, it was decided, assuming they became available, to initially test the vaccine candidates in the most relevant animal infection model possible -non-human primates. small-animal vaccine models can be misleading and time consuming. soon after, a macaque infection model was published 17, 18 , and significant efforts were made to secure primates for these studies. however, recently there have been significant concerns that primate models are not the best infection models, and tests in many laboratories indicate that they only exhibit mild respiratory infections 19 .at present, ferrets seem to be the most relevant disease model 20 , and relevant murine models have been developed that allow viral replication 21 . owing to the high costs of doing primate experiments in biosafety level iii containment facilities and the concerns about the relevance of a primate challenge model, at present savi vaccines are first tested in ferrets and mice, and then in non-human primates or other small animals for safety and immunogenicity. similarly, other groups are testing adenoviruses 22 , modified vaccinia viruses 23 and a dna vaccine 24 in both murine and macaque models. although this additional step adds time to the project, it is necessary and imperative to show protection in an animal infection model that closely mimics human disease. it was anticipated that testing in multiple animal models would also help eliminate concerns regarding vaccine-induced immune enhancement or immunopathology 14 .in addition to the fundamental scientific questions associated with vaccine development, there are several related issues that impacted directly on the success of the project (fig. 3) .include the spike (s) surface glycoprotein that is found on the viral surface (giving the viral particle a 'crown' and therefore its name) and the nucleocapsid (n) protein that is found inside the viral particle and which packages the rna viral genome (fig. 2) . deciding on which antigens and which vaccine approach to use posed significant challenges, as each has both advantages and disadvantages.most research groups chose a particular vaccine method that they were familiar with. by contrast, savi chose to develop three vaccine approaches in parallel, only making the final decision on which candidate should progress to human clinical trials after a direct comparison of the three vaccines in relevant animal infection models. this strategy also provided the opportunity to use more than one vaccine in a prime-boost strategy if necessary. although this approach initially required more work, it was thought that it would significantly increase the likelihood of a successful vaccine being developed. so, work began on the three strategies: developing whole killed inactivated virus; developing a recombinant s protein; and modifying adenovirus and vaccinia virus to express the sars-cov s and n proteins. both whole killed virus and recombinant s protein were targeted at inducing neutralizing antibodies, whereas the adenovirus and vaccinia virus vectors were targeted at inducing both cellular immunity and neutralizing antibodies. as the and proved important in bringing together disparate research communities into a common effort. researchers who obtained funding are still held accountable to standard grant regulations and research guidelines, including adequate accounting and reporting on completion of the project. a project director periodically reviews progress with each of the funded collaborators to ensure adequate progress and relevance, as well as coordinating diverse research groups.international collaboration and vaccine development. as sars was a pandemic, international coordination and collaboration was essential. the who had an important role in coordinating responses during and following the epidemic. in addition, in october 2003, the who hosted a meeting in geneva that was attended by nearly all of the main research groups working on the sars-cov and sars vaccines. this meeting was useful in many respects, including allowing the various groups to discuss strategies and progress, resolving intellectual property and regulatory issues, and selecting and developing animal models. several additional collaborations were formed at this meeting, as well as a better understanding of where the world stood with regard to vaccines. more recently, in february 2004, the who held a meeting in rotterdam to reach a consensus regarding which animal models represent the best infection models to test sars vaccine candidates. although a macaque model has been described for sars 17 , there were still questions regarding its suitability for vaccine testing. at least three north american laboratories have had little success in observing lung pathology and severe clinical signs in macaques after live sars-cov challenge 19 . factors such as the dose or strain of sars-cov, the route of administration and the day of autopsy might account for the variability between the laboratories.the consensus at the who meeting in rotterdam was that standardization of conditions for sars-cov challenge was needed in the different laboratories before nonhuman primates could be used for vaccine testing. some strains of mice, such as balb/c and c57, have been shown to support sars-cov replication, but do not demonstrate significant pathology or clinical disease 21 . other small-animal models for sars such as ferrets 20 and hamsters (unpublished observations at the who meeting in rotterdam, 2004; ref. 19) also support viral replication and demonstrate some level of pathology that is similar to humans. these animals offer in canada and the united states were extremely supportive and willing to work according to a 'risk-benefit' platform and if sars had developed into the next major pandemic, they would have done everything possible to expedite the approval process to counter the risk of disease. now that sars is currently not a major threat, most agree that normal regulatory approval mechanisms should apply, and expediting vaccine approval might be unnecessary.handling the media. any major disease outbreak receives significant media attention, and there is a continual demand for updates about research progress into potential therapeutics and preventatives such as vaccines. therefore, mechanisms need to be in place to deal responsibly with media requests as these projects progress. consequently, a system was established that enabled effective communication with the media as needed and provided a consistent message that handled (but did not expand) expectations and provided important messages about the progress of the project. media briefings were also provided every six months. scientific symposia were held every six months to keep the entire savi group of collaborators abreast of progress being made in different areas of the project.funding mechanisms. an important hurdle in rapid response research is distributing funds to researchers in a timely manner. the timeframe from starting to write a peerreviewed grant application to when funds are received in the laboratory is usually more than one year, which is unsuitable for rapid response research. so rapid funding mechanisms must be established to ensure that appropriate research is carried out in a timely manner. when savi was established, the michael smith foundation for health research, the provincial health research funding agency in british columbia, was used to control and dispense the research funds. using a five-member senior management committee consisting of senior scientists, a rapid review mechanism was established. short (2-page), focused research proposals, together with a proposed research budget, which dealt directly with aspects of vaccine development, were solicited and accepted from the research community. the committee reviewed and evaluated the projects on the basis of scientific merit and the direct need for the project, and funds were dispersed to successful applicants immediately -usually 24 hours after the application was submitted. while ensuring that applications were peer-reviewed, this rapid review process significantly enhanced the speed of the project, nature reviews | microbiology volume 2 | july 2004 | 6 0 5 infectious diseases that was exemplified by sars is patient consent. when clinical samples are taken, especially early during the outbreak, the potential research uses of such samples are not known, and it is difficult to specify exactly what they will be used for. however, having a large collection of clinical samples is crucial to understanding an infectious disease, and mechanisms for collecting and sharing such samples must be in place before an outbreak occurs.for any vaccine or therapeutic product to be used in human clinical trials, it has to be made under stringent gmp 26 . ideally, all rapid response research would be done under such conditions from the start, but this is nearly impossible, especially with infectious agents. instead, once a candidate vaccine or therapeutic is identified, the work has to be reproduced under such conditions, which significantly lengthens the production time. at the outset, if standardized cell lines (such as vero cells), attenuated viral vectors (such as adenovirus) and adjuvant (alum) are chosen that are already approved for human use, significant time can be saved in product development 15, 26 . sars is particularly challenging as it requires biosafety level iii containment. all animal studies must be done in stringent containment facilities, of which there are only a few in the world. similarly, if a whole killed viral vaccine is to be manufactured, highly specialized biosafety level iii gmp facilities are needed, again few of which exist worldwide 27 . owing to the perceived threat of biological agents, several biosafety level iii containment facilities have recently been approved for construction. however, performing rapid response research on highly infectious agents that are new to the world places a major burden on such specialized facilities, especially biosafety level iii large animal (primate) and gmp facilities. efficient use of such space requires global cooperation and judicial prioritization.commercialization. commercialization of a sars vaccine raises several complex issues. as it seems that sars is not a worldwide threat at present, there is not a significant commercial market. so vaccine companies are unwilling to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars that are needed to commercialize a vaccine, as they are unlikely to recover their expenses 28 . there are several reasons why industry is unwilling to commit to developing specific vaccines. first, the huge cost of vaccine development (up to us $500 million) and the small and uncertain revenue from traditional vaccines have made vaccine manufacturersthe ability to do rapid research in response to an emerging infectious disease has significant appeal. as sars was seen as a major public health threat in canada and several countries in asia, these countries in particular felt compelled to act.canada indicated that the concept of working together in rapid response research towards a sars vaccine was rapidly accepted by all researchers who were approached. in fact, other scholars from the non-life-science areas of academia also freely offered their time and skills to deal with related problems. all scientists were willing to contribute their relevant expertise and a portion of their laboratory's resources to work towards a common goal, with no particular individual gain immediately obvious. although this willingness is probably accentuated when one perceives a significant threat to one's country, it is also a powerful motivating factor when seeking to obtain particular expertise during rapid response research. similarly, international cooperation and coordination are needed to avoid significant duplication and redundancy of efforts, as well as to share progress. in an ideal situation, expertise around the world would be coordinated, but this poses major logistical and political challenges. the who had a pivotal role throughout the sars pandemic, not only in tracking the disease, but also by convening meetings of researchers working on potential vaccine therapeutics and diagnostics. in the face of future pandemics, a coordinated international rapid response research approach will be essential to develop new ways of controlling these scourges. a main difficulty with sars research was the limited availability of clinical samples to researchers and the standardization of such samples. some countries had national centres for disease control that collected and coordinated clinical samples, whereas in others it was left to the individual hospitals. an important problem with studying emerging an alternative inexpensive disease model compared with non-human primates, although reports on the use of these small animals for sars-cov vaccine testing is scarce. however, despite these different animal models, no single animal species has been shown to reproduce all of the clinical signs and lethality that is observed in humans that are infected with sars-cov.anticipating that a re-emergence of sars would be most likely to occur close to its original site of origin, savi initiated a collaboration with chinese scientists in guangdong province in southern china. this resulted in a bilateral agreement to work together on sars vaccine trials. this collaboration was greatly facilitated by strong political support from both china and canada, two countries that were significantly affected by sars. the most obvious question is how sars vaccines will be evaluated for human efficacy given the lack of human sars cases globally this year. ordinarily, phase i to phase iii human clinical trials are designed to provide an understanding of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in humans as well as identification of correlates of immunity. without an outbreak of sars that could be used to test the efficacy of the vaccines in humans, licensure of the vaccine under emergency conditions might have to take place under the fda's 'animal efficacy rule' , which states that vaccines or other biological agents can be licensed if they meet two criteria: human safety and the demonstration of adequate protection against a deliberate infection challenge in two species of animals (see vaccine policy in the online links). for the sars vaccines to go directly from animals to humans under these conditions, vaccine efficacy and safety must be evaluated in animals followed by phase i safety evaluation and immunogenicity testing in healthy human volunteers. such a phase i study is currently ongoing in china with an inactivated sars virus 19 . at present, there are not enough sars cases to test the vaccine further in phase ii and iii trials. despite the lack of an ongoing sars threat, rapid response initiatives such as savi will continue to be necessary as it is important to have a vaccine available should sars return. furthermore, such initiatives are strongly supported by internationally recognized scientists, each with a strong expertise in a particular area of research and development. this is in contrast to pharmaceutical companies where product focus is more diffuse and the expertise is suitable for gmp vaccine manufacturing and organizing clinical trials in humans."the concept of working together in rapid response research towards a sars vaccine was rapidly accepted by all researchers who were approached. all scientists were willing to … work towards a common goal"severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus (sars-cov) (marra et al., 2003; rota et al., 2003) . sars was detected for the first time in the guandong province of china in late 2002, spread rapidly around the world and resulted in more than 8000 cases, 10% of which resulted in death, in 33 countries, and areas of five continents (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mguide sars.en.html). world healh organization (who) declared the end of the sars outbreak in july 5th 2003, nevertheless, several isolated outbreaks subsequently occurred because of accidental contaminations in laboratories of taiwan, singapore, and mainland china (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). in late 2003 and early 2004, newly infected persons who had contact with animals infected with sars-cov strains significantly different from those predominating in the 2002-2003 outbreak were reported the 2002 outbreak, as sera samples collected in 2001 were positive in 1.8% of the cases (zheng et al., 2004) . furthermore, 40% of animal traders, whereas only a 5% of vegetable traders in guandong markets were seropositive for sars-cov without showing signs of disease (guan et al., 2003) .sars-cov vaccines are urgently needed to prevent potential sars epidemics. as sars-cov disease severity has been linked to age, with higher mortalities for ages over 45, special attention should be paid to vaccine development to protect elderly people. several types of vaccines are being developed, including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (vlps), dna vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from sars-cov genome by reverse genetics. this paper will review previously published sars vaccination strategies and announce new accomplishments in sars-cov based vaccination approaches while focusing on the correlates of protection, detected serotypes, vaccination side effects, and bio-safeguards that can be engineered into recombinant vaccine approaches based on the sars-cov genome.knowledge on the diversity of serotypes is essential information for vaccine design. phylogenetic analysis of sars-cov isolates from animals and humans strongly suggest that the virus originated from animals, most likely bats poon et al., 2005) , was amplified in palm civets, and transmitted to human population via live animal markets (kan et al., 2005) .the neutralization of a set of eight pseudoviruses expressing the spike glycoprotein of eight sars-cov strains selected from the three phases of the sars epidemic (early, middle and late), plus another human isolate collected at the end of 2003 (gd03), and two civet cat isolates from 2003 (sz16 and sz3) has been studied (chinese-consortium, 2004; yang et al., 2005) . human monoclonal antibodies against the s protein of the frankfurt isolate (fra-1), derived from epstein-barr virus transformed b lymphocytes were used. the virus tested in the neutralization assays included pseudotypes made with the s protein from members of the four main genetic clusters defined with the bayesian analysis of the sars-cov glycoproteins (fig. 1a ) :(i) group 1, originating from animals isolated in 2003. a prototype of this group is the isolate sz16 which primarily uses civet but not human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as a receptor. (ii) group 2, low pathogenic viruses originating from civets, raccoon dogs, or sporadic human cases, such as strain gd03 reported from a sporadic sars case in december 22, 2003 . this virus represented an independent introduction of a less pathogenic virus, having an s glycoprotein sequence that is the most divergent of all human strains (chinese-consortium, 2004) . in general, group 2 isolates appear to have a receptor binding domain (rbd) that is capable of recognizing the human ace2 receptor, and have been successfully cultured. gd03 s glycoprotein contains 18 amino acid substitutions relative to group 3 urbani s a multiple sequence alignment of the spike gene of each virus was created using clustalx 1.83 with default settings. bayesian inference was conducted with mr. bayes, with markov chain monte carlo sampling of four chains for 500,000 generations, and a consensus tree was generated using the 50% majority rule with a burn in of 1000. branch confidence values are shown as posterior probabilities. the three human isolates that fall within the animal cluster (gz0402, gd03, and gz0401) may represent infections where a human acquired the virus from animals. the dashed line between group 3 and group 4 is used to represent a much longer line in the tree (∼10 times longer), thus the distance of the line is not representative of the distance between bat and human sars.protein, many of which map within neutralizing epitopes between amino acids 130-150 and 318-510, corresponding to the rbd. recombinant viruses encoding the gd03 s glycoprotein have been isolated using reverse genetics . recombinant icgd03 virus replicates about 0.5-1.0 logs less efficiently in human airway epithelial cells (6.8 × 10 7 pfu/ml) as compared to wt urbani (3.0 × 10 7 pfu/ml) at 42 h postinfection. (iii) group 3, highly pathogenic viruses representing the 2002-2003 epidemic strains associated with the early, middle, or late phase. prototypes of these viruses are the early isolate and middle isolates gz02, and cuhk-w, respectively, and the late urbani, fra-1, or toronto 2 (tor-2) strains. (iv) group 4, bat sars-cov strains have not been successfully cultured but were sequenced from samples taken from rhinolophus spp. like the chinese horseshoe bat. these viruses differ from urbani by about 12-22% in amino acid sequence and generally have about 3-4 out of 13 contact interface residues with human ace2 receptor. using the s glycoprotein gene, an unrooted bayesian analysis suggests that bat strains are most closely related to early phase human strains.basically, all virus pseudotyped with s proteins from different strains were neutralized to the same extent, except the human gd03 and the two civet cat isolates sz16 and sz3, indicating that there were at least two human sars-cov serotypes, most likely originated from two independent transmissions of the virus from civet cat to human yang et al., 2005) . it will be important to determine if recombinant viruses bearing zoonotic s glycoproteins display similar neutralization kinetics as pseudotyped viruses bearing sars spikes.the sars-cov-like isolated from bats identified in rhinolophus spp. has a nucleotide identity with tor-2 strain higher than 92% li et al., 2005) . in addition, six novel coronaviruses from six different bat species have been described (woo et al., 2006) . four of these coronaviruses belong to group 1, and two of them to group 2. based on sequence data these authors have proposed the classification of bat cov in three subgroups (2a, 2b, and 2c). subgroup 2b comprises both sars-cov and a bat-sars-cov (rp3 isolate). the sequences of these sars-cov isolates differ in the s1 domain of the s protein, where sequence identity fell to 64%. this sequence divergence in the s1 domain corroborated the serum neutralization studies, which indicate that although bat sera have a high level of cross-reactive antibodies, they failed to neutralize human or civet cat sars-cov when tested in vero e6 cells . in contrast, other authors have reported that 42% of the bat sera samples tested neutralized human sars-cov isolate (hku-39849) using frhk-4 cells. the discrepancy could be due to the presence of a different sars-cov-like virus serotype in the bats studied by the two different groups, or to the two test systems used in the evaluation. consequently vaccine design should take into account this antigenic diversity. interestingly, recent characterization of the antigenic structure of sars-cov s protein with a large panel of mabs has shown that at least one epitope providing susceptibility to sars-cov that maps in the rbd for ace-2 is highly conserved in most virus strains and therefore, may confer protection to most sars-cov strains (he et al., 2006) .sars-cov has at least seven structural proteins (s, 3a, e, m, 7a, 7b, and n) (fig. 2) schaecher and pekosz, 2006; weiss and navas-martin, 2005) . sars-cov s, 3a, e, and m proteins are viral membrane proteins with domains exposed to the external face of the virus (ito et al., 2005; shen et al., 2005) that, in principle, could be involved in protection by induction of neutralizing antibodies. it has been shown that proteins s and 3a induce in vitro sars-cov neutralizing antibodies, with s protein being the main component of protective immunity (qiu et al., 2005; saif, 2004) . although strong immune responses are elicited against both s and n proteins subbarao et al., 2004; wang et al., 2005; zhu et al., 2004) , passive transfer studies illustrate that only s-specific antibodies confer protection from sars-cov replication in the mouse model (bisht et al., 2004; subbarao et al., 2004) .the relevance of s protein in protection against sars-cov has been reinforced by the identification of neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients. the majority of the coronavirus neutralizing epitopes are located within the spike protein of the virus hogan et al., 2004) . two domains are defined in the spike protein, the amino-terminus (s1) and the carboxy-terminus (s2) halves. in some coronaviruses, but apparently not in the case of sars-cov, the s protein is processed in these two halves (weiss and navas-martin, 2005; wong et al., 2004) . recent evidence has determined that sars-cov neutralization is sensitive to deglycosylation of the spike protein, suggesting that conformational epitopes are important in antibody recognition (song et al., 2004) . the rbd located in the s1 subunit of s protein contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes. this suggests that recombinant proteins containing rbd, and vectors encoding the rbd sequence, can be used to develop safe and effective sars vaccines . the continuous viral epitopes targeted by antibodies in plasma samples from convalescent sars patients have been identified by biopanning with a m13 phage display dodecapeptide library . these epitopes converged to very short peptide fragments, one on each of the spike, nucleocapsid, 3a, 9b and nsp3 proteins. immunoassays found that most of the patients (82%) that recovered from sars developed antibodies to the epitope-rich region on the spike s2 domain, indicating that this domain also is an immunodominant site on the s protein. these s2-targeting antibodies were shown to effectively neutralize sars-cov. moreover, it is possible that s2-specific antibodies provided protective immunity to help the patients recover from viral infection . in fact, among the rabbit antibodies elicited by different fragments covering the entire s protein expressed in e. coli, some of them were specific for aa 1029-1192, which include the heptadrepeat sequence of the s2 domain that interacts to form s protein trimers, and had neutralizing activities, indicating that this region of the s protein also carries neutralizing epitopes.sars-cov 3a protein consist of 274 amino acids, contains three putative transmembrane domains, and is expressed on the virus and cell surface (ito et al., 2005; tan et al., 2004b) . the topology of 3a protein on the cell surface was experimentally determined; the first 34 aa, located before the first transmembrane domain, are facing the extracellular matrix (akerstrom et al., 2006) , and its c-terminal, after the third transmembrane domain (aa 134-274), is facing the cytoplasm (tan et al., 2004b) . interestingly, in two separate cohorts of sars patients, one from taiwan and the other from hong kong , b cells recognizing the n-terminal region of 3a protein were isolated from patients. moreover, significant proportion (40%) of the convalescent sars patients examined in a dot blot assay using a synthetic peptide with a sequence corresponding to amino acids 12-27 of the n terminus of the protein were positive . in addition, it was recently reported that the n-terminal domain of 3a protein elicits strong and potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients (zhong et al., 2006) . accordingly, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 15-28 of 3a protein inhibit sars-cov propagation in vero e6 cells, in contrast to antibodies specific for the c-terminal domain of the protein (akerstrom et al., 2006) . sars-cov e, m, and 7a proteins have shown low immunogenicity (tan et al., 2004a) . sera from three convalescent phase sars patients do not recognize these proteins expressed in mammalian cells. accordingly, sars-cov e protein peptides were not recognized by convalescent patient antisera using a protein microarray (qiu et al., 2005) . in a study using rabbit antibodies to 13 recombinant fragments associated with sars-cov s, e, m, n, 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 9b proteins, strong neutralizing antibodies were only elicited by the s1 fragment (aa 241-591) of s protein (qiu et al., 2005) . the incorrect folding of the proteins expressed in e. coli could be responsible for the lack of detection of antibodies to other viral proteins, such as the 3a protein that is known to induce neutralizing antibodies (see above).the m protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (tgev) is required for virus assembly and budding, and m protein specific antibodies significantly, but weakly, neutralize tgev and mediate complement-dependent lysis of tgev infected cells (delmas et al., 1986; risco et al., 1995; woods et al., 1987) . consistent with the tgev data described above, it has been shown that sars-cov m protein also induced virus neutralizing antibodies in the absence of complement . in addition, a mixture of s and m proteins showed a synergistic effect in the in vitro synthesis of tgev neutralizing antibodies by immune leukocytes . in the case of sars-cov, immunization of hamsters with a parainfluenza virus vector has shown a differential role of s, m, e, or n proteins in protection . parainfluenza virus expressing s protein alone provided complete protection against sars-cov challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract. this protection was slightly augmented by co-expression with m and e proteins . nevertheless, expression of m, e, or n proteins in the absence of s protein did not confer detectable protection. these results identify s as a main sars-cov neutralization and protective antigen among the structural proteins, and confers a limited role to sars-cov m protein in protection.sars-cov n protein specific antibodies do not neutralize the virus in vitro as it could be expected for an internal virus protein (pang et al., 2004) . however, sars-cov n protein induces t-cell responses (gao et al., 2003) . accordingly, dna immunization using sars-cov n gene induces potent th1 polarized immune responses in mice, as well as specific antibodies in these animals. in fact, the highest levels of humoral response and t cell proliferation activity were induced by the n gene construct (jin et al., 2005) . analysis of the immune response to another coronavirus (tgev), using an in vitro antibody synthesis system, has shown that the optimum combination of viral proteins to stimulate the production of tgev neutralizing antibodies in vitro was a mixture of s and n proteins, or a combination of s protein oligomers (rosettes) and the n or n protein-derived peptides (anton et al., 1996; anton et al., 1995) . these data, in principle, suggest that n protein could be used in a vaccine to promote the synthesis of s-specific neutralizing antibodies.9b protein (98 aa) elicits antibodies in sars-cov patients, indicating that it is expressed in natural disease and that it is immunogenic (qiu et al., 2005; zhong et al., 2005) . in fact 100% of convalescent phase patients sera were positive for 9b protein.based on this data, it has been speculated that 9b protein could be structural (qiu et al., 2005) . nevertheless, the presence of 9b protein in sars-cov virions needs to be further proved.in summary, with the available data, sars-cov proteins s and 3a elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses, whereas protein m only induces a reduced neutralizing humoral immune response. these antigens probably are relevant in the protection against sars-cov. in addition, other structural proteins (such as e, m, 7a, 7b, and n), and possibly protein 9b, could also play a role in protection.to study the role of the humoral immune response to sars-cov, spike specific monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the virus have been developed subbarao et al., 2004; traggiai et al., 2004; zhang et al., 2004) . passive transfer of these monoclonal antibodies or immune serum into naïve mice protected them from infection with sars-cov . using epstein-barr virus transformed human b cells, the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from sars-cov infection has been rescued (traggiai et al., 2004) . some of the monoclonal antibodies exhibited neutralization activity in vitro, and some of them also conferred protection in a mouse model of sars-cov infection. in addition, human igg monoclonal antibodies neutralizing sars-cov developed using phage display libraries protected ferret from lung disease and virus shedding in pharyngeal secretions (ter meulen et al., 2004) . in both mouse and ferret models, administration of human monoclonal antibodies with in vitro neutralization activity reduced sars-cov titers in the lungs 3 to 6-log10-unit, protecting from lung pathology in ferrets (ter meulen et al., 2004) . overall, these data indicate that humoral immune responses alone can protect against sars.immune responses to sars-cov, elicited by a dna vaccine encoding a codon optimized sars spike protein , or the s1 fragment, induced neutralizing antibodies (zeng et al., 2004) , as well as t-cell responses. nevertheless, protection from sars-cov challenge was mediated by a humoral immune response but not by a t-cell-dependent mechanism .surprisingly, immunodeficient mice can clear a sars-cov infection, showing the role of innate immune responses in the defenses against sars-cov. c57bl/6 mice that lack nk-t cells (cd1 −/− ), or nk cells, or those that lack t and b cells (ragl −/− ) cleared the virus by day 9 after infection (glass et al., 2004) and displayed high induction of proinflammatory cytokines. these data suggest that the nk cells and the adaptative immune response were not essential for virus clearance in mice. possibly, interferon pathways were relevant in viral clearance. the importance of interferon response was reinforced by infecting stat1-deficient mice with sars-cov (hogan et al., 2004) . stat1 is important to the regulation of interferons, and stat1-deficient mice produced one hundred-fold increase in viral titer over control mice. additionally, the mutant mice developed interstitial pneumonia, not seen in control mice (hogan et al., 2004) but not alveolar damage, as seen in lungs of human patients. it is unclear at this time if the observed pathological differences between human and stat 1-deficient mouse lungs were due to time of sampling or to differences in host responses (hogan et al., 2004) .neutralizing antibodies were detected 2-3 weeks after the onset of disease in immunocompetent sars patients, and 90% of patients recovered without hospitalization . these data indicate that most patients successfully respond to sars-cov infection. although many types of vaccines for sars-cov have been attempted such as expression of recombinant proteins, or the use of virus vectors, these vaccines require considerable research set-up time (bradbury, 2003) . therefore, the classical approach using inactivated, cell-culture based sars-cov is likely to be the easiest way for sars vaccine development, based on the experience with available vaccines including inactivated or live polio and rabies vaccines (montagnon, 1989; zhou et al., 2005) . this is the case of companies that favored the development of an inactivated candidate whole virus vaccine, based on the well-established technologies for the development of such vaccines (spruth et al., 2006) .the fast spreading of sars initially prompted a chinese company (sinovac biotech of beijin) to develop a vaccine in collaboration with the chinese academy of medical sciences that started tests of the vaccine, an inactivated form of sars-cov as early as 2004, using 30 volunteers (marshall and enserink, 2004) . no side effects were reported for the first patients that were injected with the inactivated virus.sars-cov inactivation to produce the killed vaccines has been performed using different methods. for instance, sars-cov purified by ultracentrifugation has been inactivated with ␤-propiolactone and administered with or without alhydrogel as adjuvant (see et al., 2006) . the virus subcutaneously administered to mice was more efficient than recombinant adenoviruses expressing either the s or n proteins, provided by the intranasal or intramuscular routes. an alternative method was the inactivation of sars-cov by ␤-propiolactone before initiating the purification step. immunization with this virus was compared with vaccination using dna or adenovirus vectors. the humoral immune response was most effective using inactivated virus with adjuvants such as mf59 (chiron vaccines) or alum (pierce, rockkford, il), and was associated with stimulation of the cd4 but not the cd8 response, supporting the use of inactivated sars-cov as vaccine .sars-cov has also been purified up to 98% homogeneity by ultrafiltration, gel filtration, and exchange chromatography, and inactivated with ␤-propiolactone. cynomolgus macaques were immunized with different amounts of the purified virus in the absence or in the presence of adjuvant. monkeys were challenged by the nasal route 30 days post-immunization. high levels of neutralizing antibodies that prevented the replication of sars-cov and interstitial pneumonia were induced (qin et al., 2006) .interestingly, no side effects were observed even in the presence of low titer neutralizing antibodies, indicating that the purified sars-cov vaccine is safe in monkeys.in other approaches, sars-cov partially purified in sucrose cushions was completely inactivated with formaldehyde. this virus efficiently competed the binding of infectious virus to cells, indicating that the inactivated virus kept a functional rbs (qu et al., 2005) . polyethyleneglycol precipitated virus alone or in the presence of cholera toxin b (ctb, sigma) or cpg, administered to mice by the intranasal route elicited serum sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies, and iga specific antibodies in the trachea and lungs (qu et al., 2005) .in another approach, formaldehyde inactivated whole virus, prepared in vero cells, was used in intramuscular immunization of 2-5 year-old rhesus monkeys . after 3 weeks, monkeys were challenged with sars-cov. doses of 0.5 or 5 g/monkey protected most of the monkeys against challenge with 10 8 pfu of sars-cov, and higher doses (50 g) conferred complete protection. in contrast, the control animals developed a typical sars-cov infection after challenge. the immunization preferentially induced th1 responses, but also enhanced other cellular immune responses, including the production of ifn-␥ that can increase the activity of natural killer cells and inhibit virus replication. no systemic side effects were observed in vaccinated animals post-immunization, even at the high dose (5000 g/monkey) and after two injections.one vaccine manufactured to large scale using fermenter cultures of vero cells in serum free medium has been based in a double-inactivated, whole virus vaccine (spruth et al., 2006) . virus infection at a moi of 0.001 resulted in generation of high viral titers (around 10 8 tcid 50 /ml). culture supernatants were harvested and inactivated by formalin treatment followed by uv inactivation. this two step inactivation procedure was utilized in order to ensure a high safety margin with respect to residual infectivity. mice immunized twice with l g of sars-cov vaccine using adjuvant (0.2% aluminium hydroxide) developed high antibody titers against sars-cov spike protein, as determined by an elisa test. the use of the adjuvant al(oh) 3 had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine. in addition, cell mediated immunity, as measured by the production of inf-␥ and il-4 stimulation, was elicited. the vaccine confers 100% protection that was correlated to antibody titer against the sars-cov s protein and to neutralizing antibody titer. induction of neutralizing antibodies with titers ≥114 and an s-specific elisa titer ≥25,600 resulted in 100% protection against intranasal challenge with 10 5 tcid 50 of infectious virus.a polypeptide containing amino acids 14-762 of the sars-cov spike protein has been expressed using the baculovirus system (bisht et al., 2005) . the affinity purified protein was administered to mice with either saponin or ribi as adjuvants. both regimens induced binding and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, although the best results were obtained with saponin and polypeptide, which provided the highest antibody response. after challenge, protective immunity was shown by the reduction of sars-cov titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract. this subunit vaccine induced higher neutralizing antibody and more complete protection against an intranasal challenge than that achieved by inoculation of mice with live sars-cov , vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing the full length s protein (bisht et al., 2004) , or dna expressing the full-length s or s protein lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains .n protein by itself does not provide protection against sars-cov infections. still, a large number of reports using n protein as an antigen have been published. the immune response of mice vaccinated with a purified n protein fused to glutathione stransferase (gst) was analyzed and compared with the response of two dna-based vaccination approaches (gupta et al., 2006) . the immunization with n-gst elicited a strong t-cell il-4, and antibody responses but minimal ifn-␥ response. this response differed markedly with the immune response shown by mice immunized with both dna encoding unmodified cytoplasmic n protein, and dna encoding n as a lamp-1 chimera targeted to the lysosomal mhc ii compartment. dna immunizations elicited a strong t-cell ifn-␥ and ctl responses. nevertheless, the t-cell responses to the three immunogens were elicited by the same n peptides as shown by the elispot analysis of antigen-activated t cells. in vivo protection experiments were not performed with these vaccines.the n protein of sars-cov was expressed in e. coli and purified . balb/c mice were vaccinated with n protein emulsified in montanide isa-51 containing the oligodeoxynucleotide cpg, or in pbs. in the first case, anti-n antibodies were found to be mainly igg2a, suggesting a prevalence of th1 immune response. in contrast, anti-n protein antibodies of mice immunized with n protein in pbs were found to be mainly igg1. reactivity of antisera raised against n protein formulated in isa-51/cpg in mice and monkeys and that of sera from patients were tested with a panel of overlapping peptides. the region around residues 156-175 of n protein is immunogenic in the three models. in addition, peptides corresponding to residues 1-30, 86-100, 306-320 and 351-365 contained murine immunodominant t-cell epitopes. using and ifn-␥ secretion cell assay, peptides containing residues 81-95 were capable of stimulating cd4 + and cd8 + cell proliferation in vitro. peptides corresponding to residues 336-350 were capable of stimulating inf-␥ production in t-cell cultures derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of macaques immunized with the n protein emulsified in isa-51/cpg. no protection experiments were performed with this immunogen.the requirements for sars-cov vlp formation differs using different expression systems and cell types. production of viral proteins in insect cells using baculovirus has shown intracellular sars-cov vlps assembly by expressing m and e proteins (ho et al., 2004) . secretion of these vlps to the extracellular media required the co-expression of s protein (mortola and roy, 2004) . in these experiments secretion of vlps was relatively efficient (200 g per 1 × 10 9 infected cells). these results are at variance with those obtained by expressing sars-cov proteins in human 293 renal epithelial cells under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter, using dna plasmids . in this system, any combination of genes that expressed m and n proteins, with or without s or e proteins, gener-ated intracellular vlps, and the pseudoparticles did not form in the absence of the m and n proteins. no single viral gene was able to support the formation of viral capsids within these cells. the additional expression of the s protein allowed the formation of budding particles with morphology typical of sars and related coronaviruses. different types of vlps could be formed depending of the protein composition of these sars-cov vlps. protection by the administration of vlps has not been reported.the development of plant-based vaccines against different coronaviruses [tgev, infectious bronchitis virus (ibv), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv)] using the oral delivery of recombinant s protein that elicit protective immunity has been reported (bae et al., 2003; lamphear et al., 2004; tuboly et al., 2000; zhou et al., 2003) . one of these studies include a s protein plant-based vaccine candidate against tgev that has advanced into early phase farming trials (tuboly et al., 2000) . more recently, to develop a safe, effective, and an inexpensive vaccine candidate, the s1 domain of sars-cov s protein has been expressed in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants (pogrebnyak et al., 2005) . high expression levels of recombinant s1 protein (>0.1% total soluble protein) were observed in several transgenic lines by western blot analysis using s protein specific antibodies. plant-derived antigen induced systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice, which showed significantly increased levels of sars-cov specific iga after oral ingestion of tomato fruits expressing s1 protein (pogrebnyak et al., 2005) . sera of mice parenterally primed with tobaccoderived s1 protein revealed the presence of sars-cov-specific igg.several approaches based on dna vaccination have been described in order to elicit protection against sars. two of them used prime-boost strategies and showed that the combination of the dna vaccine and the whole chemically inactivated vaccine can be used to enhance the magnitude of the immune response, and also to change the balance of humoral to cellular immune response (zakhartchouk et al., 2005a) . a combination of the dna and inactivated virus induces th1 immune responses while the whole killed virus vaccine induces th2 immune responses.mice immunized intramuscularly with a dna vaccine expressing s protein and intraperitoneally boosted with e. coli expressing s peptides showed high neutralization titers (>1:1280). this vaccine might have a practical value to immunize in farms growing civet cats due to its low cost .other dna vaccines express n protein alone or linked to calreticulin. the first ones preferentially induce igg responses of the igg2a isotype, ifn-␥ and il-2, and cd8 + ctl responses to n protein, but produce strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) that could have undesired side effects . the expression of n protein linked to calreticulin increases major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i presentation to cd8 + t cells, in the absence of reported adverse effects in mice (kim et al., 2004) . these vaccines led to the generation of strong n-specific humoral and t-cell-mediated immune responses in mice, but no protection experiments were shown. n protein has also been expressed linked to hlamp (n-hlamp), that target antigen to the mhc class ii, leading to a stronger and higher memory cellular immune response associated to high ifn-␥ production than immunization with n protein alone (gupta et al., 2006) .studies on dna immunization to protect against sars, using three forms of the spike protein: full-length s, and s proteins with the cytoplasmic or the transmembrane domains deleted have been reported . these vaccines induced neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses, resulting in protective immunity in mice. viral replication was reduced more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these s plasmid dna expression vectors. protection was mediated by a humoral but not a t-cell dependent immune mechanism, as shown by adoptive t-cell transfer in which donor t-cells were unable to reduce pulmonary viral replication in recipient animals. by contrast, passive transfer of purified igg from immunized mice, but not control igg provided immune protection against sars-cov . the vector expressing the s protein with the cytoplasmic domain partially deleted induced the most potent neutralizing antibody response.using the highly attenuated modified mva, sars-cov s protein has been expressed by several groups (bisht et al., 2004; chen et al., 2005 ). the first one has shown that intranasal or intramuscular immunization of balb/c mice elicited protective immunity as shown by the reduction of sars-cov titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract after challenge. furthermore, passive transfer of serum from mice immunized with the recombinant mva expressing s protein to naïve mice also reduced the replication of sars-cov in the respiratory tract after challenge, demonstrating a role for s protein specific antibodies in protection. the second group showed the induction of neutralizing antibodies in mice, ferrets, and monkeys, although protection experiments were not performed. in an antibody absorption assay, the majority of the antibodies raised by the mva recombinant expressing the full-length s protein were absorbed by an s protein fragment including aa 400-600, that includes the rbd, indicating that the major sars-cov neutralization mechanism likely occurs through blocking the interaction between the virus and the cellular receptor ace2.in contrast, other authors immunized ferrets using mva expressing the sars-cov s protein, inducing a vigorous immune response that did not prevent virus infection and spreading (czub et al., 2005; weingartl et al., 2004) . liver inflammation was found in all mva-spike vaccinated ferrets. these authors suggested that their results indicate the induction of antibody dependent enhancement (ade) of disease similar to that caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv).sars vaccines based on the use of adenovirus vectors have shown that expression of s protein alone or in combination with n protein led to the protection of mice against the challenge with sars-cov. the efficacy of immunization with adenovirus vectors was compared with that of chemically inactivated partially purified virus. whole-killed virus vaccine was more effective in conferring protective immunity against live sars-cov (see et al., 2006) . other adenovirus vaccines tested in mice have expressed either the s or the n protein (zakhartchouk et al., 2005b) and shown that the s2 domain and the n protein contain strong t-cell epitopes, but reported no challenge experiments. in the monkey model, adenovirus-based vaccines induce strong sars-cov-specific immune responses, indicating that these vectors are promising vaccine candidates but, again, no information on protection have been provided (gao et al., 2003) . the adenovirus ad5 vector with a deletion in the e1 and e3 regions, have also been used to express the s1 domain of the sars-cov s protein (490 aa) . wistar rats immunized three times throughout consecutive weeks produce antiserum capable of protecting from sars-cov infection in cell culture. histopathological examination found no evident side effects in the immunized animals. nevertheless, in vivo protection experiments were not performed. therefore, additional experiments are required with the adenovirus based sars vaccines.severe disease and high death rates were noted in senescent human populations infected with sars-cov, while children under 12 years of age did not develop the severe disease that was seen in adults deming et al., 2006; . these data suggest that the quality of the immune response may play a role in the outcome of virus infection. the ability of vaccines to induce robust immune responses in senescent populations has been evaluated to determine if protection can be elicited in elderly populations with senescent immune systems. to evaluate vaccine efficacy against homologous and heterologous strains, the urbani s glycoprotein and nucleocapsid genes were inserted in vee virus replicon particles (vrp-s or vrp-n) deming et al., 2006) . in addition, expression of the influenza a ha glycoprotein (vrp-ha) was used as a control. using reverse genetics, synthetically resurrected recombinant viruses bearing the gd03 s glycoprotein that replicated to high titers in vero and human airway epithelial cells have been obtained deming et al., 2006) . importantly, human convalescent sera had plaque reduction neutralization titre of 50% (prnt 50 ) values of about 1:1600 against late phase isolates like urbani, yet were reduced about 10-15 fold against the heterologous icgd03 virus (prnt 50 1:150) (fig. 3a) . young and senescent balb/c mice with ages exceeding 1 year at the time of challenge, were vaccinated with vrp-ha, vrp-s, vrp-n, or a combination of vrp-s and vrp-n, and challenged with recombinant sars-cov expressing the urbani s protein or the antigenically different gd03 s protein (fig. 3b) . in vaccinated animals, vrp-s vaccines provided complete short-and long-term protection against homologous challenge, protecting both young and senescent mice from the urbani strain replication. after challenge, vrp-s and vrp-s + vrp-n vaccinated mice displayed little if any pathologic lesions in the lung, whereas vrp-ha vaccinated aged mice demonstrate pathological lesions in the lung similar to that reported in the literature (roberts et al., 2005a) . vrp-s vaccines also provided short-term protection in young mice challenged with the heterologous gd03 s strain, despite the significantly reduced ability of anti-urbani s antibody to neutralize virus expressing gd03 s. in contrast, vaccination of senescent mice with vrp-s provided limited protection (∼38%) and the combination of vrp-s + vrp-n vaccines provided little long-term protection against infection by the antigenically different sars-cov gd03, although virus titers were reduced about 10-fold compared with vrp-ha controls. the sars-cov gd03 challenge also produced pathological lesions in both the vrp-ha and sars-vaccinated animals that were virtually indistinguishable from those produced by infection with the sars-cov-urbani strain. therefore, it is likely that declining immunity of senescent animals in combination with the reduced ability of antibody to neutralize heterologous challenge viruses resulted in vaccine failure in aged animals. it seems that vaccine approaches that induce less robust neutralization responses like dna and killed vaccines, might completely fail in protecting senescent populations against sars-cov gd03 challenge.sars-cov disease severity was linked to age and other co-morbidities, with mortality rates increasing with age and exceeding 50% in individuals over 65. it is also known that elderly respond poorly to new antigens as compared to younger populations, but overall this phenomena is poorly studied. consequently, vaccine efficacy in the elderly is a key property of efficacious sars-cov vaccines. immunosenescence is common in animal models and in clinical studies that occur during aging, and vaccine efficacy is often attenuated in the elderly (frasca et al., 2005; song et al., 1997; zheng et al., 1997) . immune complications include a generalized decrease in the function of b and t cell and innate immune function, diminished macrophage and granulocyte function, diminished cellular traffic, cell growth and differentiation and decreased natural killer cell numbers and activity. new and different vaccine regimens should be developed and tested with the ultimate goal of eliciting complete protection against antigenically heterologous forms of sars-cov, especially in the most vulnerable elderly populations, and that there is a need for further testing developing vaccines that induce an anti-n response in more animal models, similarly to what has been described in other viral systems (frech et al., 2005; mcelhaney, 2005) .a vector based in an existing live attenuated parainfluenza virus, that is being developed for intranasal pediatric immu- nization against human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hpiv3) was used to express sars-cov s protein . vector administration to monkeys resulted in the production of systemic immune response by mucosal immunization. after challenge with sars-cov, all monkeys in the control group shed sars-cov. in contrast, no viral shedding occurred in the group immunized with the parainfluenza vector expressing the s protein. recombinant viruses expressing sars-cov structural s, m, and n proteins, individually or in combination, have been evaluated for immunogenicity and protection in hamsters that support the replication of both sars-cov and parainfluenza vector . a single intranasal administration of the vector expressing the s glycoprotein induced a high titer of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies, only two fold lower than that induced by sars-cov infection. this response provided complete protection against sars-cov challenge in the lower respiratory tract, and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract. in contrast, expression of m, n, or e pro-teins did not induce detectable serum sars-cov neutralizing antibodies.a recombinant rabies virus vector has been used to express the s protein of sars-cov (faber et al., 2005) . immunogenicity studies in mice showed the induction of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies after a single dose, but no protection studies have been shown. similarly, an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) vector was used to express the s protein of sars-cov (kapadia et al., 2005) . mice vaccinated with vsv-s developed sars-cov neutralizing antibodies that controlled challenge with sars-cov performed at 1 or 4 months after a single vaccination.in summary, immunization to prevent sars using different live vector systems has shown that protection is mainly mediated by humoral immune responses to the s protein. a warning signal was that, at least with some vectors such as vee virus, the expression of n protein may lead to side effects.the effect of the deletion of group-specific genes in different coronaviruses has been studied. reports using mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) as a model have shown that deletion mutants removing orfs 4, 5a, 7a, and he are attenuating in the natural host (de haan et al., 2002a) . similarly, studies deleting orf 7 of tgev (ortego et al., 2003) and orfs 3abc and 7ab of fipv (haijema et al., 2004) led to virus attenuation. however, sars-cov deletion mutants lacking orfs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, or 7b did not significantly influence in vitro and in vivo replication efficiency in the mouse model (yount et al., 2005) . all recombinant viruses replicated to wild-type levels in the murine model, suggesting that either the group-specific orfs play little role in in vivo replication efficiency or that the mouse model is not of sufficient quality for discerning the role of the group-specific orfs in disease. in fact it has been surprising that orfs like 3a, 7a, and 7b, that encode structural virus proteins, schaecher and pekosz, 2006; yount et al., 2005) have little influence on in vivo virus replication in the mouse model. only deletion of orf 3a has shown a minor decrease (about one log unit) in virus growth (yount et al., 2005) . furthermore, deletion of more than one gene, such as deletion of orfs 3a and 3b, and orf6, showed a 1-1.5 log reduction in vero cells but little effect on growth in the murine model at day 2 postinfection. moreover, little difference in growth or pathogenesis were noted in the mice model between wt and deletion mutants lacking orf3a and orf7. therefore, the effect of sars-cov gene deletions needs to be tested in more relevant animal models. interestingly, the simultaneous deletion of larger combinations of group-specific genes such as 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b has lead to the production of an infectious sars-cov deletion-mutant that propagates in cell culture with a titer similar to that of the parental wild type virus. the potential of this deletion-mutant as a promising vaccine candidate is being studied (m.l. dediego, and l. enjuanes, unpublished results).a recombinant sars-cov (rsars-cov) that lacks the e gene generated from a bacterial artificial chromososme (bac) was attenuated in vitro and in an animal model (dediego et al., 2007) . the e gene was previously shown to be a non-essential gene for the group 2 mhv coronavirus (kuo and masters, 2003) , although elimination of this gene from mhv genome reduced virus growth in cell culture more than one thousand-fold. in contrast, for group 1 tgev coronavirus, expression of the e gene product was essential for virus release and spread. propagation of e gene deleted tgev (tgev-e) was restored by providing e protein in trans (curtis et al., 2002; ortego et al., 2002) . the role of e protein in sars-cov propagation was studied by constructing sars-cov with a deleted e gene (dediego et al., 2007) . interestingly, viable viruses were recovered in vero e6 cells with a relatively high titer (around 10 6 pfu/ml) and also from huh-7 and caco-2 cells with reduced titers (fig. 4) , indicating that sars-cov e protein is not essential for virus replication in cell culture. electron microscopy observation of vero e6 cells infected with the sars-cov wt or the e deletion mutant showed much higher assembly efficiency for the wt virus (fig. 5) . in this respect, sars-cov-e behaves as mhv, the other group 2 coronavirus studied, although sars-cov-e grows to a considerably higher titer. the differential behavior of e mutant viruses from different coronavirus groups may indicate basic differences in virion assembly or life cycles among the different groups. the hamster model has been used to study sars-cov-e virus pathogenicity, because it demonstrates elements present in human cases of sars-cov infections including interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation (dediego et al., 2007) . an ideal animal model that completely reproduces human clinical disease and pathological findings has not been identified. nevertheless, the hamster model reproducibly supports sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract to a higher titer and for a longer duration than in mice or non-human primates. virus replication in this model is accompanied by histological evidence of pneumonitis, and the animals develop viremia and extrapulmonary spread of virus (roberts et al., 2005b) . although overt clinical disease is absent, the hamster model is a useful model for the evaluation of sars-cov infection. titers of recombinant sars-cov (rsars-cov) achieved in the respiratory tract of hamsters (fig. 6) were similar to those previously reported (roberts et al., 2005b) and were 100-1000-fold higher than titers of the rsars-cov-e virus, suggesting that this mutant virus is attenuated. histopathology examination of lungs from infected hamsters was performed at two and five days post-infection, because it has been shown that pulmonary disease was most notable at these time points. detection of viral antigen was reduced in lungs from rsars-cov-e infected hamsters and pulmonary inflammation was less prominent in these animals fig. 6 . growth of rsars-cov in the respiratory tract of hamsters. hamsters were inoculated with 10 3 tcid 50 of rsars-cov or rsars-cov-e. animals were sacrified and tissues were harvested at different times post-infection. viral titers in lung (a) and nasal turbinates (b) were determined in vero e6 cells monolayers. the non-parametric mann-whitney u-statistical method was used for ascertaining the significance of observed differences. statistical significance was indicated by ( * p-value < 0.05). the dotted line indicates the lower limit of detection. than in rsars-cov-infected animals, indicating that rsars-cov-e is attenuated in vivo (dediego et al., 2007) . in fact, reduction of sars-cov titers in patients has been associated with a considerable reduction in pathogenicity and survival rates hung et al., 2004) . in contrast, challenge of hamsters with recombinant viruses lacking single group specific orfs3a and orf7 did not result in significant reductions in virus titier or pathology (baric et al., unpublished) . therefore, sars-cov-e attenuated virus is a promising vaccine candidate that is being evaluated in different animal models (mice, ferrets and macaques).live attenuated virus vaccines face a series of potential concerns including reversion to wt and recombination repair with circulating heterogeneous human coronaviruses or zoonotic sars strains. consequently, live virus vaccine formulations should include rational approaches for minimizing the potential for reversion to wt phenotype and simultaneously resist recombination repair. it is clear that modifications of sars-cov genome could lead to viruses with an attenuated phenotype that could be considered safe and effective vaccine candidates. the replicase as a target for attenuating coronaviruses is undiscovered territory, likely ripe with alleles that might influence replication efficiency and virulence. the sars-cov replicase represents a major target of future research endeavors.coronaviruses have a characteristic, strictly conserved genome organization with structural genes occurring in the order 5 -polymerase (pol)-s-e-m-n-3 . mhv virus mutants with the genes encoding the structural proteins located in different order were constructed (de haan et al., 2002b) . these recombinant viruses were tested for the ability to replicate in the natural host, the mouse. the results indicate that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for in vivo replication. some of the mutants showed an attenuated phenotype, similarly to what has been observed for the vsv (ball et al., 1999) . therefore, deliberate rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of attenuated coronaviruses, which due to their reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses would make safer vaccines.vaccines based on modifications of the replicase gene could in principle be generated by mutagenesis, as modifications introduced in the mhv nsp-1coding regions have identified residues important for protein processing and viral rna replication that may affect virus virulence and could be introduced in vaccine candidates . sars nsp1 blocks host macromolecular synthesis and abrogates ifn signaling (kamitani et al., 2006) , providing further evidence that nsp1 coding regions represent potential virulence determinants. alternatively, tyr6398his substitution in open reading frame (orf) 1b-nsp14 has been demonstrated that attenuate mhv replication in mice (sperry et al., 2005) . similarly, deletion of the nsp2 gene in mhv and sars-cov has been shown to yield viable attenuated mutant viruses that replicate about one log less efficiently than wt virus in cell culture and in animals, and may also provide a foundation for the design of live vaccines . as the nsp14 tyr residue and nsp 2 are completely conserved, it may be possible to engineer common coronaviridae attenuating alleles via recombinant dna techniques. alternatively, changes in gene order within the replicase or even relocation to the 3 -end of the genome, if tolerated, may led to attenuated virus phenotypes.other options to include safeguards into the genetically engineered vaccines, particularly those that can prevent the recovery of the original virulent phenotype by recombination between the vaccine strain and viruses circulating in the field (such as hcov-229e, -oc43, or -nl63) have been developed. one of them is the construction of replication-competent, propagationdefective viruses (pseudovirions) that are defective in one gene conferring an attenuated phenotype or even the ability for virus propagation . these viruses could be grown in packaging cell lines providing in trans the missing protein. in the case of sars-cov, vaccine candidates without the e gene have been constructed. in order to prevent the rescue of the virulent phenotype by recombination with a circulating human coronavirus, the deletion of an essential gene, located in a position distant from gene e, and the relocation of the deleted gene to the position previously occupied by gene e has been proposed. a potential recombination leading to the rescue of gene e would lead to the loss of the essential gene .an alternative approach for developing safer, recombination resistant live coronavirus vaccines has been developed by modifying the transcriptional regulatory sequences (trs) of a vaccine strain to a sequence incompatible with the trs of any known circulating coronavirus. the idea being that recombinant events between wt coronaviruses and trs remodeled sars-cov would result in genomes containing lethal mixed regulatory sequences that block expression of subgenomic mrnas (fig. 7a ) . trs sequences among coronaviruses are highly conserved and direct the expression fig. 7 . (a) genome organization of sars-cov recombinant viruses to generate safe attenuated viruses. the wild-type sars-cov trs, acgaac (blue circles), were changed to ccggat (red circles). since the wild-type and mutant trs signals are not compatible in regulating subgenomic transcription , a recombination event resulting in a viral genome with mixed trs signals is not viable. (b) the icsars-cov trs sequence is unique from that of other described coronaviruses. trs sequences for select group 1, 2 and 3 coronaviruses are summarized. the trs selected for the remodeled virus is shown at the bottom. of subgenomic mrnas. using a molecular clone, the sars-cov trs network was remodeled from acgaac to ccggat (fig. 7b ). this rewiring of the genomic transcription network allows for efficient replication of the mutant virus, icsars-crg. the icsars-crg recombinant virus replicated to titers equivalent to wt virus and expressed the typical ratios of subgenomic mrnas and proteins. interestingly, some new transcripts were noted initiating from the replicase gene, most of which could encode n-terminal truncated orf1a polyproteins. it is not clear if these novel transcripts might influence pathogenic outcomes, although in some instances nsp3 is truncated potentially allowing for the establishment of dominant negative phenotypes on replication in cell culture and animals. an attractive sars-cov vaccine could further be modified by building attenuating mutations on the genetic template of the recombination-resistant trs rewired virus either for use as a safe, high titer seed stock for making killed vaccines or as a live virus vaccine. one interesting refinement of this approach would be to include secondary traps that are activated in recombinant genomes. in this instance, wt trs sequences can be designed into intragenic sites in essential orfs like the s and m glycoprotein genes. in recombinant viruses encoding wt leader trs sequences, subgenomic transcription might initiate from within the essential structural genes and the resulting n-terminal deletions would likely be lethal or severely attenuating.both humoral and t-cell-mediated responses to animal coronaviruses may exacerbate disease or cause new health problems . t-cell responses have been implicated in the demyelinization of the brain and spinal cord following infection with neurotropic mhv (castro and perlman, 1995; wu et al., 2001) , a group 2 coronavirus like sars-cov. adverse humoral responses to another group 2 coronavirus, bovine coronavirus (bcov), have also been linked to the development of "shipping fever" in cattle (o'connor et al., 2001) . moreover, previous exposure to fipv, or passive or active immunization against this virus, a group 1 coronavirus, was found to cause the "early death syndrome" instead of providing immune protection (pedersen et al., 1981; weiss et al., 1980) . this disease exacerbation was due to the virus-specific antibodies that facilitated and enhanced uptake and spread of the virus, causing ade of infectivity (porterfield, 1986; vennema et al., 1990; weiss and scott, 1981) , that is caused by spike protein specific antibodies (corapi et al., 1995; corapi et al., 1992; olsen et al., 1993; olsen et al., 1992) .with this scenario of side effects caused by some coronavirus vaccines, a safety concern is that sars-cov could induce similar antibody-or cell-mediated immune pathologies. this concern was increased mainly by three reports. one study utilizing lentivirus pseudotyped with various sars-cov s proteins indicated that within the s protein, the major target for vaccine and immunotherapy, there are minor differences among eight strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003, whereas substantial functional changes were detected in s derived from a case in late 2003 from guan-dong province (isolate gd03) and from two palm civets (sz16 and sz3). the gd03 spike pseudotyped virus is markedly resistant to antibody neutralization. alternatively, antibodies that neutralized most human s glycoproteins, enhanced virus entry mediated by two civet cat virus s glycoproteins related to the gd03 isolate . in another report, it has been shown that the administration into ferrets of mva-based sars-cov s vaccine, but not mva alone, followed by live sars-cov challenge, resulted in enhanced hepatitis . these side effects have not been reported in other studies with sars-cov in ferrets, in which it has been shown that ferrets are a useful model for sars-cov (martina et al., 2003) . similarly, these data were not reproduced by other groups (he et al., 2006) . furthermore, ade of disease has not been observed with any human sars-cov strain, therefore it will be important to assess vaccines in relevant animal models as they become available. antibodies directed against sars-cov were found to be protective and not to enhance viral infectivity in the mouse or hamster models (bisht et al., 2004; roberts et al., 2005b; yang et al., 2004) , using inactivated sars-cov or immunization with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the s and n proteins of sars-cov (see et al., 2006) , although their effect in humans remains unknown . side effects have not been observed in other animal models such as african green monkeys that, 2 months after administration of sars-cov into the respiratory tract, were challenged with sars-cov and no evidence of enhanced disease upon re-challenge was shown .consistent with these results, cynomolgus macaques immunized with different amounts of purified virus, in the absence or the presence of adjuvant, challenged by the nasal route 30 days post-immunization showed no side effects even in the presence of low titer neutralizing antibodies. temperature, breathing, appetite, mental state, and all biochemical indexes were normal for immunized monkeys, and no abnormalities were observed in major organs such as lung, liver, kidney, etc. all control nonvaccinated animals showed interstitial pneumonia. these results indicate that the purified sars-cov vaccine is safe in monkeys (qin et al., 2006) . in summary, immunization of mice using either s protein or whole inactivated virus (spruth et al., 2006) , or of monkeys with whole inactivated sars-cov (qin et al., 2006; zhou et al., 2005) , most frequently resulted in the absence of side effects after providing different types of sars-cov vaccines.in contrast, vee virus expressing n protein failed to induce protection in either young or senescent animals, and resulted in enhanced immunopathology following viral challenge between days 4 and 14 post-infection. therefore, caution has to be taken before including n in vaccine formulations by expressing n protein using dna immunization, or vee vectors , as no protection was elicited in mice against homologous challenge, and no benefit to vaccination with a cocktail of both s and n proteins was observed. rather, the co-expression of n protein in vaccine regimens which failed to simultaneously induce a strong neutralizing anti-s antibody response led to an increased number of lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates, which are also characteristic of the immune pathology observed with respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection fol-lowing vaccination with formalin inactivated rsv (de swart et al., 2002; hancock et al., 1996) . therefore, the concern has been raised that expression of n protein may result in vaccineenhanced pulmonary disease, as previously described for viruses like rsv (kim et al., 1969) . the data suggest that the presence of n protein in vaccines should be evaluated in each vaccine formulation . although thus far, no human sars-cov s vaccine has been shown to be involved in ade of disease, possible immunopathological complications of sars vaccine candidates require rigorous clinical and immunological evaluation.whereas the production of effective and safe vaccines for animal coronavirus previously reported has not been satisfactory (cavanagh, 2003; enjuanes et al., 1995; saif, 2004) , the production of inactivated, subunit, or vaccines based on dna, recombinant vectors, or by reverse genetics using sars-cov genomes seem more promising. an optimum animal model for sars-cov vaccine evaluation is still required. after preclinical trials in animal models efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humans.severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus (sars-cov) (marra et al., 2003; rota et al., 2003) . sars was detected for the first time in the guandong province of china in late 2002, spread rapidly around the world and resulted in more than 8000 cases, 10% of which resulted in death, in 33 countries, and areas of five continents (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mguidesars.en.html). world healh organization (who) declared the end of the sars outbreak in july 5th 2003, nevertheless, several isolated outbreaks subsequently occurred because of accidental contaminations in laboratories of taiwan, singapore, and mainland china (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/). in late 2003 and early 2004, newly infected persons who had contact with animals infected with sars-cov strains significantly different from those predominating in the 2002-2003 outbreak were reported in guandong, china . these events indicate that a sars epidemic may recur at any time in the future, although this event most likely would require the generation of new isolates evolving from sars-cov-like virus circulating in animals . as a consequence of this possibility, and because sars-cov could be used as a virus, having an s glycoprotein sequence that is the most divergent of all human strains (chinese-consortium, 2004) . in general, group 2 isolates appear to have a receptor binding domain (rbd) that is capable of recognizing the human ace2 receptor, and have been successfully cultured. gd03 s glycoprotein contains 18 amino acid substitutions relative to group 3 urbani s protein, many of which map within neutralizing epitopes between amino acids 130-150 and 318-510, corresponding to the rbd. recombinant viruses encoding the gd03 s glycoprotein have been isolated using reverse genetics . recombinant icgd03 virus replicates about 0.5-1.0 logs less efficiently in human airway epithelial cells (6.8 × 10 7 pfu/ml) as compared to wt urbani (3.0 × 10 7 pfu/ml) at 42 h postinfection.iii. group 3, highly pathogenic viruses representing the 2002-2003 epidemic strains associated with the early, middle, or late phase. prototypes of these viruses are the early isolate and middle isolates gz02, and cuhk-w, respectively, and the late urbani, fra-1, or toronto 2 (tor-2) strains.iv. group 4, bat sars-cov strains have not been successfully cultured but were sequenced from samples taken from rhinolophus spp. like the chinese horseshoe bat. these viruses differ from urbani by about 12-22% in amino acid sequence and generally have about 3-4 out of 13 contact interface residues with human ace2 receptor. using the s glycoprotein gene, an unrooted bayesian analysis suggests that bat strains are most closely related to early phase human strains.basically, all virus pseudotyped with s proteins from different strains were neutralized to the same extent, except the human gd03 and the two civet cat isolates sz16 and sz3, indicating that there were at least two human sars-cov serotypes, most likely originated from two independent transmissions of the virus from civet cat to human yang et al., 2005) . it will be important to determine if recombinant viruses bearing zoonotic s glycoproteins display similar neutralization kinetics as pseudotyped viruses bearing sars spikes.the sars-cov-like isolated from bats identified in rhinolophus spp. has a nucleotide identity with tor-2 strain higher than 92% li et al., 2005) . in addition, six novel coronaviruses from six different bat species have been described (woo et al., 2006) . four of these coronaviruses belong to group 1, and two of them to group 2. based on sequence data these authors have proposed the classification of bat cov in three subgroups (2a, 2b, and 2c). subgroup 2b comprises both sars-cov and a bat-sars-cov (rp3 isolate). the sequences of these sars-cov isolates differ in the s1 domain of the s protein, where sequence identity fell to 64%. this sequence divergence in the s1 domain corroborated the serum neutralization studies, which indicate that although bat sera have a high level of cross-reactive antibodies, they failed to neutralize human or civet cat sars-cov when tested in vero e6 cells . in contrast, other authors have reported that 42% of the bat sera samples tested neutralized human sars-cov isolate (hku-39849) using frhk-4 cells. the discrepancy could be due to the presence of a different sars-cov-like virus serotype in the bats studied by the two different groups, or to the two test systems used in the evaluation. consequently vaccine design should take into account this antigenic diversity. interestingly, recent characterization of the antigenic structure of sars-cov s protein with a large panel of mabs has shown that at least one epitope providing susceptibility to sars-cov that maps in the rbd for ace-2 is highly conserved in most virus strains and therefore, may confer protection to most sars-cov strains (he et al., 2006) .sars-cov has at least seven structural proteins (s, 3a, e, m, 7a, 7b, and n) (fig. 2) schaecher and pekosz, 2006; weiss and navas-martin, 2005) . sars-cov s, 3a, e, and m proteins are viral membrane proteins with domains exposed to the external face of the virus (ito et al., 2005; shen et al., 2005) that, in principle, could be involved in protection by induction of neutralizing antibodies. it has been shown that proteins s and 3a induce in vitro sars-cov neutralizing antibodies, with s protein being the main component of protective immunity (qiu et al., 2005; saif, 2004) . although strong immune responses are elicited against both s and n proteins subbarao et al., 2004; zhu et al., 2004) , passive transfer studies illustrate that only s-specific antibodies confer protection from sars-cov replication in the mouse model (bisht et al., 2004; subbarao et al., 2004) .the relevance of s protein in protection against sars-cov has been reinforced by the identification of neutralizing antibodies from convalescent patients. the majority of the coronavirus neutralizing epitopes are located within the spike protein of the virus hogan et al., 2004) . two domains are defined in the spike protein, the aminoterminus (s1) and the carboxy-terminus (s2) halves. in some coronaviruses, but apparently not in the case of sars-cov, the s protein is processed in these two halves (weiss and navas-martin, 2005; wong et al., 2004) . recent evidence has determined that sars-cov neutralization is sensitive to deglycosylation of the spike protein, suggesting that conformational epitopes are important in antibody recognition (song et al., 2004) . the rbd located in the s1 subunit of s protein contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes. this suggests that recombinant proteins containing rbd, and vectors encoding the rbd sequence, can be used to develop safe and effective sars vaccines . the continuous viral epitopes targeted by antibodies in plasma samples from convalescent sars patients have been identified by biopanning with a m13 phage display dodecapeptide library . these epitopes converged to very short peptide fragments, one on each of the spike, nucleocapsid, 3a, 9b and nsp3 proteins. immunoassays found that most of the patients (82%) that recovered from sars developed antibodies to the epitope-rich region on the spike s2 domain, indicating that this domain also is an immunodominant site on the s protein. these s2-targeting antibodies were shown to effectively neutralize sars-cov. moreover, it is possible that s2-specific antibodies provided protective immunity to help the patients recover from viral infection . in fact, among the rabbit antibodies elicited by different fragments covering the entire s protein expressed in e. coli, some of them were specific for aa 1029-1192, which include the heptad-repeat sequence of the s2 domain that interacts to form s protein trimers, and had neutralizing activities, indicating that this region of the s protein also carries neutralizing epitopes.sars-cov 3a protein consist of 274 amino acids, contains three putative transmembrane domains, and is expressed on the virus and cell surface (ito et al., 2005; tan et al., 2004b) . the topology of 3a protein on the cell surface was experimentally determined; the first 34 aa, located before the first transmembrane domain, are facing the extracellular matrix (akerstrom et al., 2006) , and its c-terminal, after the third transmembrane domain (aa 134-274), is facing the cytoplasm (tan et al., 2004b) . interestingly, in two separate cohorts of sars patients, one from taiwan and the other from hong kong , b cells recognizing the n-terminal region of 3a protein were isolated from patients. moreover, significant proportion (40%) of the convalescent sars patients examined in a dot blot assay using a synthetic peptide with a sequence corresponding to amino acids 12-27 of the n terminus of the protein were positive . in addition, it was recently reported that the n-terminal domain of 3a protein elicits strong and potentially protective humoral responses in infected patients (zhong et al., 2006) . accordingly, rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 15-28 of 3a protein inhibit sars-cov propagation in vero e6 cells, in contrast to antibodies specific for the c-terminal domain of the protein (akerstrom et al., 2006) .sars-cov e, m, and 7a proteins have shown low immunogenicity (tan et al., 2004a) . sera from three convalescent phase sars patients do not recognize these proteins expressed in mammalian cells. accordingly, sars-cov e protein peptides were not recognized by convalescent patient antisera using a protein microarray (qiu et al., 2005) . in a study using rabbit antibodies to 13 recombinant fragments associated with sars-cov s, e, m, n, 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 9b proteins, strong neutralizing antibodies were only elicited by the s1 fragment (aa 241-591) of s protein (qiu et al., 2005) . the incorrect folding of the proteins expressed in e. coli could be responsible for the lack of detection of antibodies to other viral proteins, such as the 3a protein that is known to induce neutralizing antibodies (see above).the m protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (tgev) is required for virus assembly and budding, and m protein specific antibodies significantly, but weakly, neutralize tgev and mediate complement-dependent lysis of tgev infected cells (delmas et al., 1986; risco et al., 1995; woods et al., 1987) . consistent with the tgev data described above, it has been shown that sars-cov m protein also induced virus neutralizing antibodies in the absence of complement . in addition, a mixture of s and m proteins showed a synergistic effect in the in vitro synthesis of tgev neutralizing antibodies by immune leukocytes . in the case of sars-cov, immunization of hamsters with a parainfluenza virus vector has shown a differential role of s, m, e, or n proteins in protection . parainfluenza virus expressing s protein alone provided complete protection against sars-cov challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract. this protection was slightly augmented by coexpression with m and e proteins . nevertheless, expression of m, e, or n proteins in the absence of s protein did not confer detectable protection. these results identify s as a main sars-cov neutralization and protective antigen among the structural proteins, and confers a limited role to sars-cov m protein in protection.sars-cov n protein specific antibodies do not neutralize the virus in vitro as it could be expected for an internal virus protein (pang et al., 2004) . however, sars-cov n protein induces t-cell responses (gao et al., 2003) . accordingly, dna immunization using sars-cov n gene induces potent th1 polarized immune responses in mice, as well as specific antibodies in these animals. in fact, the highest levels of humoral response and t cell proliferation activity were induced by the n gene construct (jin et al., 2005) . analysis of the immune response to another coronavirus (tgev), using an in vitro antibody synthesis system, has shown that the optimum combination of viral proteins to stimulate the production of tgev neutralizing antibodies in vitro was a mixture of s and n proteins, or a combination of s protein oligomers (rosettes) and the n or n protein-derived peptides (anton et al., 1996; anton et al., 1995) . these data, in principle, suggest that n protein could be used in a vaccine to promote the synthesis of s-specific neutralizing antibodies.9b protein (98 aa) elicits antibodies in sars-cov patients, indicating that it is expressed in natural disease and that it is immunogenic (qiu et al., 2005; zhong et al., 2005) . in fact 100% of convalescent phase patients sera were positive for 9b protein. based on this data, it has been speculated that 9b protein could be structural (qiu et al., 2005) . nevertheless, the presence of 9b protein in sars-cov virions needs to be further proved.in summary, with the available data, sars-cov proteins s and 3a elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses, whereas protein m only induces a reduced neutralizing humoral immune response. these antigens probably are relevant in the protection against sars-cov. in addition, other structural proteins (such as e, m, 7a, 7b, and n), and possibly protein 9b, could also play a role in protection.to study the role of the humoral immune response to sars-cov, spike specific monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the virus have been developed subbarao et al., 2004; traggiai et al., 2004; zhang et al., 2004) . passive transfer of these monoclonal antibodies or immune serum into naïve mice protected them from infection with sars-cov . using epstein-barr virus transformed human b cells, the memory repertoire of a patient who recovered from sars-cov infection has been rescued (traggiai et al., 2004) . some of the monoclonal antibodies exhibited neutralization activity in vitro, and some of them also conferred protection in a mouse model of sars-cov infection. in addition, human igg monoclonal antibodies neutralizing sars-cov developed using phage display libraries protected ferret from lung disease and virus shedding in pharyngeal secretions (ter meulen et al., 2004) . in both mouse and ferret models, administration of human monoclonal antibodies with in vitro neutralization activity reduced sars-cov titers in the lungs 3 to 6-log10-unit, protecting from lung pathology in ferrets (ter meulen et al., 2004) . overall, these data indicate that humoral immune responses alone can protect against sars.immune responses to sars-cov, elicited by a dna vaccine encoding a codon optimized sars spike protein , or the s1 fragment, induced neutralizing antibodies (zeng et al., 2004) , as well as t-cell responses. nevertheless, protection from sars-cov challenge was mediated by a humoral immune response but not by a t-cell-dependent mechanism .surprisingly, immunodeficient mice can clear a sars-cov infection, showing the role of innate immune responses in the defenses against sars-cov. c57bl/6 mice that lack nk-t cells (cd1 −/− ), or nk cells, or those that lack t and b cells (ragl −/− ) cleared the virus by day 9 after infection (glass et al., 2004) and displayed high induction of proinflammatory cytokines. these data suggest that the nk cells and the adaptative immune response were not essential for virus clearance in mice. possibly, interferon pathways were relevant in viral clearance. the importance of interferon response was reinforced by infecting stat1-deficient mice with sars-cov (hogan et al., 2004) . stat1 is important to the regulation of interferons, and stat1-deficient mice produced one hundred-fold increase in viral titer over control mice. additionally, the mutant mice developed interstitial pneumonia, not seen in control mice (hogan et al., 2004) but not alveolar damage, as seen in lungs of human patients. it is unclear at this time if the observed pathological differences between human and stat 1-deficient mouse lungs were due to time of sampling or to differences in host responses (hogan et al., 2004) .neutralizing antibodies were detected 2-3 weeks after the onset of disease in immunocompetent sars patients, and 90% of patients recovered without hospitalization . these data indicate that most patients successfully respond to sars-cov infection. although many types of vaccines for sars-cov have been attempted such as expression of recombinant proteins, or the use of virus vectors, these vaccines require considerable research set-up time (bradbury, 2003) . therefore, the classical approach using inactivated, cell-culture based sars-cov is likely to be the easiest way for sars vaccine development, based on the experience with available vaccines including inactivated or live polio and rabies vaccines (montagnon, 1989; zhou et al., 2005) . this is the case of companies that favored the development of an inactivated candidate whole virus vaccine, based on the well-established technologies for the development of such vaccines (spruth et al., 2006) .the fast spreading of sars initially prompted a chinese company (sinovac biotech of beijin) to develop a vaccine in collaboration with the chinese academy of medical sciences that started tests of the vaccine, an inactivated form of sars-cov as early as 2004, using 30 volunteers (marshall and enserink, 2004) . no side effects were reported for the first patients that were injected with the inactivated virus.sars-cov inactivation to produce the killed vaccines has been performed using different methods. for instance, sars-cov purified by ultracentrifugation has been inactivated with β-propiolactone and administered with or without alhydrogel as adjuvant (see et al., 2006) . the virus subcutaneously administered to mice was more efficient than recombinant adenoviruses expressing either the s or n proteins, provided by the intranasal or intramuscular routes. an alternative method was the inactivation of sars-cov by β-propiolactone before initiating the purification step. immunization with this virus was compared with vaccination using dna or adenovirus vectors. the humoral immune response was most effective using inactivated virus with adjuvants such as mf59 (chiron vaccines) or alum (pierce, rockkford, il), and was associated with stimulation of the cd4 but not the cd8 response, supporting the use of inactivated sars-cov as vaccine .sars-cov has also been purified up to 98% homogeneity by ultrafiltration, gel filtration, and exchange chromatography, and inactivated with β-propiolactone. cynomolgus macaques were immunized with different amounts of the purified virus in the absence or in the presence of adjuvant. monkeys were challenged by the nasal route 30 days post-immunization. high levels of neutralizing antibodies that prevented the replication of sars-cov and interstitial pneumonia were induced (qin et al., 2006) .interestingly, no side effects were observed even in the presence of low titer neutralizing antibodies, indicating that the purified sars-cov vaccine is safe in monkeys.in other approaches, sars-cov partially purified in sucrose cushions was completely inactivated with formaldehyde. this virus efficiently competed the binding of infectious virus to cells, indicating that the inactivated virus kept a functional rbs (qu et al., 2005) . polyethyleneglycol precipitated virus alone or in the presence of cholera toxin b (ctb, sigma) or cpg, administered to mice by the intranasal route elicited serum sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies, and iga specific antibodies in the trachea and lungs (qu et al., 2005) .in another approach, formaldehyde inactivated whole virus, prepared in vero cells, was used in intramuscular immunization of 2-5 year-old rhesus monkeys . after 3 weeks, monkeys were challenged with sars-cov. doses of 0.5 or 5 μg/monkey protected most of the monkeys against challenge with 10 8 pfu of sars-cov, and higher doses (50 μg) conferred complete protection. in contrast, the control animals developed a typical sars-cov infection after challenge. the immunization preferentially induced th1 responses, but also enhanced other cellular immune responses, including the production of ifn-γ that can increase the activity of natural killer cells and inhibit virus replication. no systemic side effects were observed in vaccinated animals post-immunization, even at the high dose (5000 μg/monkey) and after two injections.one vaccine manufactured to large scale using fermenter cultures of vero cells in serum free medium has been based in a double-inactivated, whole virus vaccine (spruth et al., 2006) . virus infection at a moi of 0.001 resulted in generation of high viral titers (around 10 8 tcid 50 /ml). culture supernatants were harvested and inactivated by formalin treatment followed by uv inactivation. this two step inactivation procedure was utilized in order to ensure a high safety margin with respect to residual infectivity. mice immunized twice with l μg of sars-cov vaccine using adjuvant (0.2% aluminium hydroxide) developed high antibody titers against sars-cov spike protein, as determined by an elisa test. the use of the adjuvant al(oh) 3 had only a minor effect on the immunogenicity of the vaccine. in addition, cell mediated immunity, as measured by the production of inf-γ and il-4 stimulation, was elicited. the vaccine confers 100% protection that was correlated to antibody titer against the sars-cov s protein and to neutralizing antibody titer. induction of neutralizing antibodies with titers ≥114 and an s-specific elisa titer ≥25,600 resulted in 100% protection against intranasal challenge with 10 5 tcid 50 of infectious virus.a polypeptide containing amino acids 14-762 of the sars-cov spike protein has been expressed using the baculovirus system (bisht et al., 2005) . the affinity purified protein was administered to mice with either saponin or ribi as adjuvants. both regimens induced binding and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, although the best results were obtained with saponin and polypeptide, which provided the highest antibody response. after challenge, protective immunity was shown by the reduction of sars-cov titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract. this subunit vaccine induced higher neutralizing antibody and more complete protection against an intranasal challenge than that achieved by inoculation of mice with live sars-cov , vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing the full length s protein (bisht et al., 2004) , or dna expressing the full-length s or s protein lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains .n protein by itself does not provide protection against sars-cov infections. still, a large number of reports using n protein as an antigen have been published. the immune response of mice vaccinated with a purified n protein fused to glutathione s-transferase (gst) was analyzed and compared with the response of two dna-based vaccination approaches (gupta et al., 2006) . the immunization with n-gst elicited a strong t-cell il-4, and antibody responses but minimal ifn-γ response. this response differed markedly with the immune response shown by mice immunized with both dna encoding unmodified cytoplasmic n protein, and dna encoding n as a lamp-1 chimera targeted to the lysosomal mhc ii compartment. dna immunizations elicited a strong t-cell ifn-γ and ctl responses. nevertheless, the t-cell responses to the three immunogens were elicited by the same n peptides as shown by the elispot analysis of antigen-activated t cells. in vivo protection experiments were not performed with these vaccines.the n protein of sars-cov was expressed in e. coli and purified . balb/c mice were vaccinated with n protein emulsified in montanide isa-51 containing the oligodeoxynucleotide cpg, or in pbs. in the first case, anti-n antibodies were found to be mainly igg2a, suggesting a prevalence of th1 immune response. in contrast, anti-n protein antibodies of mice immunized with n protein in pbs were found to be mainly igg1. reactivity of antisera raised against n protein formulated in isa-51/cpg in mice and monkeys and that of sera from patients were tested with a panel of overlapping peptides. the region around residues 156-175 of n protein is immunogenic in the three models. in addition, peptides corresponding to residues 1-30, 86-100, 306-320 and 351-365 contained murine immunodominant t-cell epitopes. using and ifn-γ secretion cell assay, peptides containing residues 81-95 were capable of stimulating cd4 + and cd8 + cell proliferation in vitro. peptides corresponding to residues 336-350 were capable of stimulating inf-γ production in t-cell cultures derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of macaques immunized with the n protein emulsified in isa-51/cpg. no protection experiments were performed with this immunogen.the requirements for sars-cov vlp formation differs using different expression systems and cell types. production of viral proteins in insect cells using baculovirus has shown intracellular sars-cov vlps assembly by expressing m and e proteins (ho et al., 2004) . secretion of these vlps to the extracellular media required the co-expression of s protein (mortola and roy, 2004) . in these experiments secretion of vlps was relatively efficient (200 μg per 1 × 10 9 infected cells). these results are at variance with those obtained by expressing sars-cov proteins in human 293 renal epithelial cells under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter, using dna plasmids . in this system, any combination of genes that expressed m and n proteins, with or without s or e proteins, generated intracellular vlps, and the pseudoparticles did not form in the absence of the m and n proteins. no single viral gene was able to support the formation of viral capsids within these cells. the additional expression of the s protein allowed the formation of budding particles with morphology typical of sars and related coronaviruses. different types of vlps could be formed depending of the protein composition of these sars-cov vlps. protection by the administration of vlps has not been reported.the development of plant-based vaccines against different coronaviruses [tgev, infectious bronchitis virus (ibv), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv)] using the oral delivery of recombinant s protein that elicit protective immunity has been reported (bae et al., 2003; lamphear et al., 2004; tuboly et al., 2000; zhou et al., 2003) . one of these studies include a s protein plant-based vaccine candidate against tgev that has advanced into early phase farming trials (tuboly et al., 2000) . more recently, to develop a safe, effective, and an inexpensive vaccine candidate, the s1 domain of sars-cov s protein has been expressed in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants (pogrebnyak et al., 2005) . high expression levels of recombinant s1 protein (>0.1% total soluble protein) were observed in several transgenic lines by western blot analysis using s protein specific antibodies. plant-derived antigen induced systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice, which showed significantly increased levels of sars-cov specific iga after oral ingestion of tomato fruits expressing s1 protein (pogrebnyak et al., 2005) . sera of mice parenterally primed with tobacco-derived s1 protein revealed the presence of sars-cov-specific igg.several approaches based on dna vaccination have been described in order to elicit protection against sars. two of them used prime-boost strategies and showed that the combination of the dna vaccine and the whole chemically inactivated vaccine can be used to enhance the magnitude of the immune response, and also to change the balance of humoral to cellular immune response (zakhartchouk et al., 2005a) . a combination of the dna and inactivated virus induces th1 immune responses while the whole killed virus vaccine induces th2 immune responses.mice immunized intramuscularly with a dna vaccine expressing s protein and intraperitoneally boosted with e. coli expressing s peptides showed high neutralization titers (>1:1280). this vaccine might have a practical value to immunize in farms growing civet cats due to its low cost .other dna vaccines express n protein alone or linked to calreticulin. the first ones preferentially induce igg responses of the igg2a isotype, ifn-γ and il-2, and cd8 + ctl responses to n protein, but produce strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) that could have undesired side effects . the expression of n protein linked to calreticulin increases major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i presentation to cd8 + t cells, in the absence of reported adverse effects in mice (kim et al., 2004) . these vaccines led to the generation of strong n-specific humoral and t-cell-mediated immune responses in mice, but no protection experiments were shown. n protein has also been expressed linked to hlamp (n-hlamp), that target antigen to the mhc class ii, leading to a stronger and higher memory cellular immune response associated to high ifn-γ production than immunization with n protein alone (gupta et al., 2006) .studies on dna immunization to protect against sars, using three forms of the spike protein: full-length s, and s proteins with the cytoplasmic or the transmembrane domains deleted have been reported . these vaccines induced neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses, resulting in protective immunity in mice. viral replication was reduced more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these s plasmid dna expression vectors. protection was mediated by a humoral but not a t-cell dependent immune mechanism, as shown by adoptive t-cell transfer in which donor t-cells were unable to reduce pulmonary viral replication in recipient animals. by contrast, passive transfer of purified igg from immunized mice, but not control igg provided immune protection against sars-cov . the vector expressing the s protein with the cytoplasmic domain partially deleted induced the most potent neutralizing antibody response.using the highly attenuated modified mva, sars-cov s protein has been expressed by several groups (bisht et al., 2004; chen et al., 2005 ). the first one has shown that intranasal or intramuscular immunization of balb/c mice elicited protective immunity as shown by the reduction of sars-cov titers in the upper and lower respiratory tract after challenge. furthermore, passive transfer of serum from mice immunized with the recombinant mva expressing s protein to naïve mice also reduced the replication of sars-cov in the respiratory tract after challenge, demonstrating a role for s protein specific antibodies in protection. the second group showed the induction of neutralizing antibodies in mice, ferrets, and monkeys, although protection experiments were not performed. in an antibody absorption assay, the majority of the antibodies raised by the mva recombinant expressing the full-length s protein were absorbed by an s protein fragment including aa 400-600, that includes the rbd, indicating that the major sars-cov neutralization mechanism likely occurs through blocking the interaction between the virus and the cellular receptor ace2.in contrast, other authors immunized ferrets using mva expressing the sars-cov s protein, inducing a vigorous immune response that did not prevent virus infection and spreading (czub et al., 2005; weingartl et al., 2004) . liver inflammation was found in all mva-spike vaccinated ferrets. these authors suggested that their results indicate the induction of antibody dependent enhancement (ade) of disease similar to that caused by feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv).sars vaccines based on the use of adenovirus vectors have shown that expression of s protein alone or in combination with n protein led to the protection of mice against the challenge with sars-cov. the efficacy of immunization with adenovirus vectors was compared with that of chemically inactivated partially purified virus. whole-killed virus vaccine was more effective in conferring protective immunity against live sars-cov (see et al., 2006) . other adenovirus vaccines tested in mice have expressed either the s or the n protein (zakhartchouk et al., 2005b) and shown that the s2 domain and the n protein contain strong t-cell epitopes, but reported no challenge experiments. in the monkey model, adenovirus-based vaccines induce strong sars-cov-specific immune responses, indicating that these vectors are promising vaccine candidates but, again, no information on protection have been provided (gao et al., 2003) . the adenovirus ad5 vector with a deletion in the e1 and e3 regions, have also been used to express the s1 domain of the sars-cov s protein (490 aa) . wistar rats immunized three times throughout consecutive weeks produce antiserum capable of protecting from sars-cov infection in cell culture. histopathological examination found no evident side effects in the immunized animals. nevertheless, in vivo protection experiments were not performed. therefore, additional experiments are required with the adenovirus based sars vaccines.severe disease and high death rates were noted in senescent human populations infected with sars-cov, while children under 12 years of age did not develop the severe disease that was seen in adults deming et al., 2006; ng et al., 2004) . these data suggest that the quality of the immune response may play a role in the outcome of virus infection. the ability of vaccines to induce robust immune responses in senescent populations has been evaluated to determine if protection can be elicited in elderly populations with senescent immune systems. to evaluate vaccine efficacy against homologous and heterologous strains, the urbani s glycoprotein and nucleocapsid genes were inserted in vee virus replicon particles (vrp-s or vrp-n) deming et al., 2006) . in addition, expression of the influenza a ha glycoprotein (vrp-ha) was used as a control. using reverse genetics, synthetically resurrected recombinant viruses bearing the gd03 s glycoprotein that replicated to high titers in vero and human airway epithelial cells have been obtained deming et al., 2006) . importantly, human convalescent sera had plaque reduction neutralization titre of 50% (prnt 50 ) values of about 1:1600 against late phase isolates like urbani, yet were reduced about 10-15 fold against the heterologous icgd03 virus (prnt 50 1:150) (fig. 3a) . young and senescent balb/c mice with ages exceeding 1 year at the time of challenge, were vaccinated with vrp-ha, vrp-s, vrp-n, or a combination of vrp-s and vrp-n, and challenged with recombinant sars-cov expressing the urbani s protein or the antigenically different gd03 s protein (fig. 3b) . in vaccinated animals, vrp-s vaccines provided complete short-and long-term protection against homologous challenge, protecting both young and senescent mice from the urbani strain replication. after challenge, vrp-s and vrp-s + vrp-n vaccinated mice displayed little if any pathologic lesions in the lung, whereas vrp-ha vaccinated aged mice demonstrate pathological lesions in the lung similar to that reported in the literature (roberts et al., 2005a) . vrp-s vaccines also provided short-term protection in young mice challenged with the heterologous gd03 s strain, despite the significantly reduced ability of anti-urbani s antibody to neutralize virus expressing gd03 s. in contrast, vaccination of senescent mice with vrp-s provided limited protection (~38%) and the combination of vrp-s + vrp-n vaccines provided little long-term protection against infection by the antigenically different sars-cov gd03, although virus titers were reduced about 10-fold compared with vrp-ha controls. the sars-cov gd03 challenge also produced pathological lesions in both the vrp-ha and sars-vaccinated animals that were virtually indistinguishable from those produced by infection with the sars-cov-urbani strain. therefore, it is likely that declining immunity of senescent animals in combination with the reduced ability of antibody to neutralize heterologous challenge viruses resulted in vaccine failure in aged animals. it seems that vaccine approaches that induce less robust neutralization responses like dna and killed vaccines, might completely fail in protecting senescent populations against sars-cov gd03 challenge.sars-cov disease severity was linked to age and other co-morbidities, with mortality rates increasing with age and exceeding 50% in individuals over 65. it is also known that elderly respond poorly to new antigens as compared to younger populations, but overall this phenomena is poorly studied. consequently, vaccine efficacy in the elderly is a key property of efficacious sars-cov vaccines. immunosenescence is common in animal models and in clinical studies that occur during aging, and vaccine efficacy is often attenuated in the elderly (frasca et al., 2005; song et al., 1997; zheng et al., 1997) . immune complications include a generalized decrease in the function of b and t cell and innate immune function, diminished macrophage and granulocyte function, diminished cellular traffic, cell growth and differentiation and decreased natural killer cell numbers and activity. new and different vaccine regimens should be developed and tested with the ultimate goal of eliciting complete protection against antigenically heterologous forms of sars-cov, especially in the most vulnerable elderly populations, and that there is a need for further testing developing vaccines that induce an anti-n response in more animal models, similarly to what has been described in other viral systems (frech et al., 2005; mcelhaney, 2005) .a vector based in an existing live attenuated parainfluenza virus, that is being developed for intranasal pediatric immunization against human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hpiv3) was used to express sars-cov s protein . vector administration to monkeys resulted in the production of systemic immune response by mucosal immunization. after challenge with sars-cov, all monkeys in the control group shed sars-cov. in contrast, no viral shedding occurred in the group immunized with the parainfluenza vector expressing the s protein. recombinant viruses expressing sars-cov structural s, m, and n proteins, individually or in combination, have been evaluated for immunogenicity and protection in hamsters that support the replication of both sars-cov and parainfluenza vector . a single intranasal administration of the vector expressing the s glycoprotein induced a high titer of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies, only two fold lower than that induced by sars-cov infection. this response provided complete protection against sars-cov challenge in the lower respiratory tract, and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract. in contrast, expression of m, n, or e proteins did not induce detectable serum sars-cov neutralizing antibodies.a recombinant rabies virus vector has been used to express the s protein of sars-cov (faber et al., 2005) . immunogenicity studies in mice showed the induction of sars-cov neutralizing antibodies after a single dose, but no protection studies have been shown. similarly, an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) vector was used to express the s protein of sars-cov (kapadia et al., 2005) . mice vaccinated with vsv-s developed sars-cov neutralizing antibodies that controlled challenge with sars-cov performed at 1 or 4 months after a single vaccination.in summary, immunization to prevent sars using different live vector systems has shown that protection is mainly mediated by humoral immune responses to the s protein. a warning signal was that, at least with some vectors such as vee virus, the expression of n protein may lead to side effects.the effect of the deletion of group-specific genes in different coronaviruses has been studied. reports using mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) as a model have shown that deletion mutants removing orfs 4, 5a, 7a, and he are attenuating in the natural host (de haan et al., 2002a) . similarly, studies deleting orf 7 of tgev (ortego et al., 2003) and orfs 3abc and 7ab of fipv (haijema et al., 2004) led to virus attenuation. however, sars-cov deletion mutants lacking orfs 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, or 7b did not significantly influence in vitro and in vivo replication efficiency in the mouse model (yount et al., 2005) . all recombinant viruses replicated to wildtype levels in the murine model, suggesting that either the group-specific orfs play little role in in vivo replication efficiency or that the mouse model is not of sufficient quality for discerning the role of the group-specific orfs in disease. in fact it has been surprising that orfs like 3a, 7a, and 7b, that encode structural virus proteins, schaecher and pekosz, 2006; yount et al., 2005) have little influence on in vivo virus replication in the mouse model. only deletion of orf 3a has shown a minor decrease (about one log unit) in virus growth (yount et al., 2005) . furthermore, deletion of more than one gene, such as deletion of orfs 3a and 3b, and orf6, showed a 1-1.5 log reduction in vero cells but little effect on growth in the murine model at day 2 postinfection. moreover, little difference in growth or pathogenesis were noted in the mice model between wt and deletion mutants lacking orf3a and orf7. therefore, the effect of sars-cov gene deletions needs to be tested in more relevant animal models. interestingly, the simultaneous deletion of larger combinations of group-specific genes such as 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b has lead to the production of an infectious sars-cov deletion-mutant that propagates in cell culture with a titer similar to that of the parental wild type virus. the potential of this deletion-mutant as a promising vaccine candidate is being studied (m.l. dediego, and l. enjuanes, unpublished results).a recombinant sars-cov (rsars-cov) that lacks the e gene generated from a bacterial artificial chromososme (bac) was attenuated in vitro and in an animal model (dediego et al., 2007) . the e gene was previously shown to be a non-essential gene for the group 2 mhv coronavirus (kuo and masters, 2003) , although elimination of this gene from mhv genome reduced virus growth in cell culture more than one thousand-fold. in contrast, for group 1 tgev coronavirus, expression of the e gene product was essential for virus release and spread.propagation of e gene deleted tgev (tgev-δe) was restored by providing e protein in trans (curtis et al., 2002; ortego et al., 2002) .the role of e protein in sars-cov propagation was studied by constructing sars-cov with a deleted e gene (dediego et al., 2007) . interestingly, viable viruses were recovered in vero e6 cells with a relatively high titer (around 10 6 pfu/ml) and also from huh-7 and caco-2 cells with reduced titers (fig. 4) , indicating that sars-cov e protein is not essential for virus replication in cell culture. electron microscopy observation of vero e6 cells infected with the sars-cov wt or the δe deletion mutant showed much higher assembly efficiency for the wt virus (fig. 5) . in this respect, sars-cov-δe behaves as mhv, the other group 2 coronavirus studied, although sars-cov-δe grows to a considerably higher titer. the differential behavior of δe mutant viruses from different coronavirus groups may indicate basic differences in virion assembly or life cycles among the different groups.the hamster model has been used to study sars-cov-δe virus pathogenicity, because it demonstrates elements present in human cases of sars-cov infections including interstitial pneumonitis and consolidation (dediego et al., 2007) . an ideal animal model that completely reproduces human clinical disease and pathological findings has not been identified. nevertheless, the hamster model reproducibly supports sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract to a higher titer and for a longer duration than in mice or non-human primates.virus replication in this model is accompanied by histological evidence of pneumonitis, and the animals develop viremia and extrapulmonary spread of virus (roberts et al., 2005b) . although overt clinical disease is absent, the hamster model is a useful model for the evaluation of sars-cov infection. titers of recombinant sars-cov (rsars-cov) achieved in the respiratory tract of hamsters (fig. 6) were similar to those previously reported (roberts et al., 2005b) and were 100-1000-fold higher than titers of the rsars-cov-δe virus, suggesting that this mutant virus is attenuated. histopathology examination of lungs from infected hamsters was performed at two and five days post-infection, because it has been shown that pulmonary disease was most notable at these time points. detection of viral antigen was reduced in lungs from rsars-cov-δe infected hamsters and pulmonary inflammation was less prominent in these animals than in rsars-cov-infected animals, indicating that rsars-cov-δe is attenuated in vivo (dediego et al., 2007) . in fact, reduction of sars-cov titers in patients has been associated with a considerable reduction in pathogenicity and survival rates hung et al., 2004) . in contrast, challenge of hamsters with recombinant viruses lacking single group specific orfs3a and orf7 did not result in significant reductions in virus titier or pathology (baric et al., unpublished) . therefore, sars-cov-δe attenuated virus is a promising vaccine candidate that is being evaluated in different animal models (mice, ferrets and macaques).live attenuated virus vaccines face a series of potential concerns including reversion to wt and recombination repair with circulating heterogeneous human coronaviruses or zoonotic sars strains. consequently, live virus vaccine formulations should include rational approaches for minimizing the potential for reversion to wt phenotype and simultaneously resist recombination repair. it is clear that modifications of sars-cov genome could lead to viruses with an attenuated phenotype that could be considered safe and effective vaccine candidates. the replicase as a target for attenuating coronaviruses is undiscovered territory, likely ripe with alleles that might influence replication efficiency and virulence. the sars-cov replicase represents a major target of future research endeavors.coronaviruses have a characteristic, strictly conserved genome organization with structural genes occurring in the order 5′-polymerase (pol)-s-e-m-n-3′. mhv virus mutants with the genes encoding the structural proteins located in different order were constructed (de haan et al., 2002b) . these recombinant viruses were tested for the ability to replicate in the natural host, the mouse. the results indicate that the canonical coronavirus genome organization is not essential for in vivo replication. some of the mutants showed an attenuated phenotype, similarly to what has been observed for the vsv (ball et al., 1999) . therefore, deliberate rearrangement of the viral genes may be useful in the generation of attenuated coronaviruses, which due to their reduced risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses would make safer vaccines.vaccines based on modifications of the replicase gene could in principle be generated by mutagenesis, as modifications introduced in the mhv nsp-1coding regions have identified residues important for protein processing and viral rna replication that may affect virus virulence and could be introduced in vaccine candidates . sars nsp1 blocks host macromolecular synthesis and abrogates ifn signaling (kamitani et al., 2006) , providing further evidence that nsp1 coding regions represent potential virulence determinants. alternatively, tyr6398his substitution in open reading frame (orf) 1b-nsp14 has been demonstrated that attenuate mhv replication in mice (sperry et al., 2005) . similarly, deletion of the nsp2 gene in mhv and sars-cov has been shown to yield viable attenuated mutant viruses that replicate about one log less efficiently than wt virus in cell culture and in animals, and may also provide a foundation for the design of live vaccines . as the nsp14 tyr residue and nsp 2 are completely conserved, it may be possible to engineer common coronaviridae attenuating alleles via recombinant dna techniques. alternatively, changes in gene order within the replicase or even relocation to the 3′-end of the genome, if tolerated, may led to attenuated virus phenotypes.other options to include safeguards into the genetically engineered vaccines, particularly those that can prevent the recovery of the original virulent phenotype by recombination between the vaccine strain and viruses circulating in the field (such as hcov-229e, -oc43, or -nl63) have been developed. one of them is the construction of replication-competent, propagationdefective viruses (pseudovirions) that are defective in one gene conferring an attenuated phenotype or even the ability for virus propagation . these viruses could be grown in packaging cell lines providing in trans the missing protein. in the case of sars-cov, vaccine candidates without the e gene have been constructed. in order to prevent the rescue of the virulent phenotype by recombination with a circulating human coronavirus, the deletion of an essential gene, located in a position distant from gene e, and the relocation of the deleted gene to the position previously occupied by gene e has been proposed. a potential recombination leading to the rescue of gene e would lead to the loss of the essential gene (enjuanes, 2005 ).an alternative approach for developing safer, recombination resistant live coronavirus vaccines has been developed by modifying the transcriptional regulatory sequences (trs) of a vaccine strain to a sequence incompatible with the trs of any known circulating coronavirus. the idea being that recombinant events between wt coronaviruses and trs remodeled sars-cov would result in genomes containing lethal mixed regulatory sequences that block expression of subgenomic mrnas (fig. 7a ) . trs sequences among coronaviruses are highly conserved and direct the expression of subgenomic mrnas. using a molecular clone, the sars-cov trs network was remodeled from acgaac to ccggat (fig. 7b ). this rewiring of the genomic transcription network allows for efficient replication of the mutant virus, icsars-crg. the icsars-crg recombinant virus replicated to titers equivalent to wt virus and expressed the typical ratios of subgenomic mrnas and proteins. interestingly, some new transcripts were noted initiating from the replicase gene, most of which could encode n-terminal truncated orf1a polyproteins. it is not clear if these novel transcripts might influence pathogenic outcomes, although in some instances nsp3 is truncated potentially allowing for the establishment of dominant negative phenotypes on replication in cell culture and animals. an attractive sars-cov vaccine could further be modified by building attenuating mutations on the genetic template of the recombination-resistant trs rewired virus either for use as a safe, high titer seed stock for making killed vaccines or as a live virus vaccine. one interesting refinement of this approach would be to include secondary traps that are activated in recombinant genomes. in this instance, wt trs sequences can be designed into intragenic sites in essential orfs like the s and m glycoprotein genes. in recombinant viruses encoding wt leader trs sequences, subgenomic transcription might initiate from within the essential structural genes and the resulting n-terminal deletions would likely be lethal or severely attenuating.both humoral and t-cell-mediated responses to animal coronaviruses may exacerbate disease or cause new health problems . t-cell responses have been implicated in the demyelinization of the brain and spinal cord following infection with neurotropic mhv (castro and perlman, 1995; wu et al., 2001) , a group 2 coronavirus like sars-cov. adverse humoral responses to another group 2 coronavirus, bovine coronavirus (bcov), have also been linked to the development of "shipping fever" in cattle (o'connor et al., 2001) . moreover, previous exposure to fipv, or passive or active immunization against this virus, a group 1 coronavirus, was found to cause the "early death syndrome" instead of providing immune protection (pedersen et al., 1981; weiss et al., 1980) . this disease exacerbation was due to the virus-specific antibodies that facilitated and enhanced uptake and spread of the virus, causing ade of infectivity (porterfield, 1986; vennema et al., 1990; weiss and scott, 1981) , that is caused by spike protein specific antibodies (corapi et al., 1995; corapi et al., 1992; olsen et al., 1993; olsen et al., 1992) .with this scenario of side effects caused by some coronavirus vaccines, a safety concern is that sars-cov could induce similar antibody-or cell-mediated immune pathologies. this concern was increased mainly by three reports. one study utilizing lentivirus pseudotyped with various sars-cov s proteins indicated that within the s protein, the major target for vaccine and immunotherapy, there are minor differences among eight strains transmitted during human outbreaks in early 2003, whereas substantial functional changes were detected in s derived from a case in late 2003 from guandong province (isolate gd03) and from two palm civets (sz16 and sz3). the gd03 spike pseudotyped virus is markedly resistant to antibody neutralization. alternatively, antibodies that neutralized most human s glycoproteins, enhanced virus entry mediated by two civet cat virus s glycoproteins related to the gd03 isolate . in another report, it has been shown that the administration into ferrets of mva-based sars-cov s vaccine, but not mva alone, followed by live sars-cov challenge, resulted in enhanced hepatitis . these side effects have not been reported in other studies with sars-cov in ferrets, in which it has been shown that ferrets are a useful model for sars-cov (martina et al., 2003) . similarly, these data were not reproduced by other groups (he et al., 2006) . furthermore, ade of disease has not been observed with any human sars-cov strain, therefore it will be important to assess vaccines in relevant animal models as they become available. antibodies directed against sars-cov were found to be protective and not to enhance viral infectivity in the mouse or hamster models (bisht et al., 2004; roberts et al., 2005b; subbarao et al., 2004; yang et al., 2004) , using inactivated sars-cov or immunization with recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the s and n proteins of sars-cov (see et al., 2006) , although their effect in humans remains unknown . side effects have not been observed in other animal models such as african green monkeys that, 2 months after administration of sars-cov into the respiratory tract, were challenged with sars-cov and no evidence of enhanced disease upon re-challenge was shown .consistent with these results, cynomolgus macaques immunized with different amounts of purified virus, in the absence or the presence of adjuvant, challenged by the nasal route 30 days post-immunization showed no side effects even in the presence of low titer neutralizing antibodies. temperature, breathing, appetite, mental state, and all biochemical indexes were normal for immunized monkeys, and no abnormalities were observed in major organs such as lung, liver, kidney, etc. all control non-vaccinated animals showed interstitial pneumonia.these results indicate that the purified sars-cov vaccine is safe in monkeys (qin et al., 2006) . in summary, immunization of mice using either s protein or whole inactivated virus (spruth et al., 2006) , or of monkeys with whole inactivated sars-cov (qin et al., 2006; zhou et al., 2005) , most frequently resulted in the absence of side effects after providing different types of sars-cov vaccines.in contrast, vee virus expressing n protein failed to induce protection in either young or senescent animals, and resulted in enhanced immunopathology following viral challenge between days 4 and 14 post-infection. therefore, caution has to be taken before including n in vaccine formulations by expressing n protein using dna immunization, or vee vectors , as no protection was elicited in mice against homologous challenge, and no benefit to vaccination with a cocktail of both s and n proteins was observed. rather, the co-expression of n protein in vaccine regimens which failed to simultaneously induce a strong neutralizing anti-s antibody response led to an increased number of lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates, which are also characteristic of the immune pathology observed with respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection following vaccination with formalin inactivated rsv (de swart et al., 2002; hancock et al., 1996) . therefore, the concern has been raised that expression of n protein may result in vaccine-enhanced pulmonary disease, as previously described for viruses like rsv (kim et al., 1969) . the data suggest that the presence of n protein in vaccines should be evaluated in each vaccine formulation . although thus far, no human sars-cov s vaccine has been shown to be involved in ade of disease, possible immunopathological complications of sars vaccine candidates require rigorous clinical and immunological evaluation.whereas the production of effective and safe vaccines for animal coronavirus previously reported has not been satisfactory (cavanagh, 2003; enjuanes et al., 1995; saif, 2004) , the production of inactivated, subunit, or vaccines based on dna, recombinant vectors, or by reverse genetics using sars-cov genomes seem more promising. an optimum animal model for sars-cov vaccine evaluation is still required. after preclinical trials in animal models efficacy and safety evaluation of the most promising vaccine candidates described has to be performed in humans. mr. bayes, with markov chain monte carlo sampling of four chains for 500,000 generations, and a consensus tree was generated using the 50% majority rule with a burn in of 1000. branch confidence values are shown as posterior probabilities. the three human isolates that fall within the animal cluster (gz0402, gd03, and gz0401) may represent infections where a human acquired the virus from animals. the dashed line between group 3 and group 4 is used to represent a much longer line in the tree (~10 times longer), thus the distance of the line is not representative of the distance between bat and human sars. growth of rsars-cov in the respiratory tract of hamsters. hamsters were inoculated with 10 3 tcid 50 of rsars-cov or rsars-cov-δe. animals were sacrified and tissues were harvested at different times post-infection. viral titers in lung (a) and nasal turbinates (b) were determined in vero e6 cells monolayers. the non-parametric mann-whitney u-statistical method was used for ascertaining the significance of observed differences. statistical significance was indicated by ( * p-value < 0.05). the dotted line indicates the lower limit of detection. (a) genome organization of sars-cov recombinant viruses to generate safe attenuated viruses. the wild-type sars-cov trs, acgaac (blue circles), were changed to ccggat (red circles). since the wild-type and mutant trs signals are not compatible in regulating subgenomic transcription , a recombination event resulting in a viral genome with mixed trs signals is not viable. (b) the icsars-cov trs sequence is unique from that of other described coronaviruses. trs sequences for select group 1, 2 and 3 coronaviruses are summarized. the trs selected for the remodeled virus is shown at the bottom.the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), a hitherto unknown β-coronavirus, emerged as a causative agent of a severe respiratory disease in humans in 2012. this new coronavirus was first isolated from the sputum of a patient suffering from severe pneumonia and renal failure [1] . to date, the mers-cov still causes disease and death in humans with a total of 2260 confirmed cases including 803 fatalities [2, 3] . epidemiological data suggest that the mers-cov is endemic in saudi arabia, which accounts for the majority of primary community-acquired cases. many of those primary cases are due to virus exposure through direct contact with dromedary camels, the primary animal reservoir of mers-cov. alternatively, camel workers undergoing subclinical infections are suggested to mediate virus transmission to other susceptible individuals [4, 5] . other outbreaks of mers have been caused by nosocomial transmissions in health care settings [6] [7] [8] [9] . most of the mers-cov infections occur within the arabian peninsula, i.e., saudi arabia, qatar, and united arab emirates, however mers cases have been reported in various other countries around the world [9, 10] .female balb/c mice (6 to 10-week-old) were purchased from charles river laboratories (sulzfeld, germany). for experimental work, mice were housed in an isolated (iso) cage unit (tecniplast, hohenpeißenberg, germany) and had free access to food and water. all animal experiments were handled in compliance with the german regulations for animal experimentation (animal welfare act, approved by the government of upper bavaria, munich, germany).primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (cef) were prepared from 10-day-old chicken embryos (spf eggs, valo, cuxhaven, germany) and maintained in minimum essential medium eagle (mem) (sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, germany) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fbs) (sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, germany), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, germany), and 1% mem non-essential amino acid solution (sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, germany). human hela (atcc ccl-2) cells were maintained in mem containing 10% fbs and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. human hacat (cls cell lines service gmbh, eppelheim, germany) cells were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, germany) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fbs, 2% hepes-solution (sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, germany) and antibiotics as described above. all cells were maintained at 37 • c and 5% co 2 atmosphere.the cdna encoding the entire amino acid (aa) sequence (413 aa) of the mers-cov n protein was in silico modified by introducing silent codon alterations to remove three termination signals (tttttnt) for vaccinia virus early transcription and two g/c nucleotide runs from the original mers-cov gene sequence (human betacoronavirus 2c emc/2012, genbank accession no. jx869059). a cdna fragment was generated by dna synthesis (invitrogen life technology, regensburg, germany) and cloned into the mva transfer plasmid piiih5red [45] to place the mers-cov n gene sequence under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus early/late promoter pmh5 [46] resulting in the mva vector plasmid piiih5red-mers-n.recombinant mva was generated using standard methodology as described previously [45] . briefly, monolayers of nearly confluent cef grown in six-well tissue culture plates (sarstedt, nürnbrecht, germany) were infected with non-recombinant mva (clonal isolate mva f6) at 0.05 multiplicity of infection (moi) and, 45 min after infection, cef cells were transfected with plasmid piiih5red-mers-n dna using x-tremegene dna transfection reagent lipofectamine (roche diagnostics, penzberg, germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. at 48 h after infection, the cell cultures were harvested and recombinant mva expressing the mers-cov n protein was clonally isolated by consecutive rounds of plaque purification in cef by screening for transient co-expression of the red fluorescent marker protein mcherry.quality control experiments were performed using standard methodology [45] . genetic identity and genetic stability of the recombinant virus were assessed via polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis of the genomic viral dna. replicative capacities of the mva vector virus was tested in multi-step growth experiments in cef and human hacat and hela cells.to generate high titer vaccine preparations for preclinical studies, recombinant mva was amplified in cef, purified by ultracentrifugation through 36% sucrose cushions, resuspended in 10 mm tris-hcl buffer, ph 9.0, and stored at −80 • c. the sucrose purified mva-mers-n vaccine preparations corresponded in total protein/total dna content to the purity profile of a mva candidate vaccine for human use.confluent cell monolayers of cef or hacat cells were infected at a moi of 5 with recombinant mva expressing the mers-cov n or s protein [23] . non-infected (mock) or wild-type mva-infected cells served as controls. cell lysates were prepared at different time points after infection and stored at −80 • c. total cell proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-10% polyacrylamide gel (sds-page) and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane via electroblotting. after 1 h blocking in a phosphate buffered saline (pbs) buffer containing 1% (w/v) non-fat dried milk and 0.1% (v/v) np-40 detergent, the blots were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-mers-cov nucleocapsid antibody (sino biological, beijing, china, 1:1000), monoclonal rabbit anti-mers-cov spike protein s1 antibody (sino biological, 1:500), or polyclonal sera from mers-cov infected rabbits or cynomolgus macaques (kindly provided by dr. bart haagmans, erasmus medical center, rotterdam, 1:1000) [23] as primary antibodies. after washing with 0.1% np-40 in pbs, the blots were incubated with anti-mouse igg (1:5000), or anti-rabbit igg antibody (1:5000), or protein a (1:1000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (cell signaling technology, frankfurt am main, germany). after further washing, blots were developed using supersignal®west dura extended duration substrate (thermo fisher scientific, planegg, gemany).groups of female balb/c mice (n = 2 to 5) were immunized twice within a 21-day interval with 10 8 plaque-forming-units (pfu) of recombinant mva-mers-n or non-recombinant mva (mva) or pbs as mock vaccine. vaccinations were given via the intramuscular (i.m.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) route using 25 µl (i.m.) or 200 µl (i.p.) volumes per inoculation. all mice were monitored daily for welfare and potential adverse events of immunization. at day 8 post prime-boost immunization, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and spleens were taken for t cell analysis.for t cell immune monitoring, we identified 101 individual synthetic peptides (assigned as 1 to 101) in silico spanning the entire mers-cov n protein sequence (human betacoronavirus 2c emc/2012, genbank accession no. jx869059). this peptide library was designed to contain 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 aa. eighty-four peptides could be synthesized (thermo fisher scientific) and were organized into two-dimensional matrix peptide pools (v1 to v9 and h1 to h9) containing 9 or 10 peptides as described previously [47, 48] . for further t cell epitope mapping, the 11 aa sequence shared between peptide #89 and #90 was trimmed into 8-10-mer peptides, which were also obtained from thermo fisher scientific. all peptides were dissolved in pbs to a concentration of 2 mg/ml and stored at −20 • c until use.spleens were harvested on day 8 post prime-boost vaccination. splenocytes were prepared by passing through a 70 µm strainer (falcon®, a corning brand, corning, usa) and incubating with red blood cell lysis buffer (sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, germany). cells were washed and resuspended in rpmi 1640 medium (sigma-aldrich) containing 10% heat inactivated fbs and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. splenocytes were further processed by using the quadromacs kit (miltenyi biotec, bergisch gladbach, germany) to separate cd8+ and cd4+ splenocytes with macs micro beads (miltenyi biotec, bergisch gladbach, germany).ifn-γ-producing t cells were measured using elispot assays (elispot kit for mouse ifn-γ, mabtech, germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, 1 × 10 6 splenocytes were seeded in 96-well plates (sarstedt, nürnbrecht, germany) and stimulated with peptide pools or individual peptides (2 µg peptide/ml rpmi 1640 medium) at 37 • c for 48 h. non-stimulated cells and cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) (sigma-aldrich) and ionomycin (sigma-aldrich, taufkirchen, germany) or mva f2l [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] peptide (f2l, spgaagydl, thermo fisher scientific, planegg, germany) [49] served as negative and positive controls, respectively. automated elispot plate reader software (a.el.vis eli.scan, a.el.vis elispot analysis software, hannover, germany) was used to count and analyze spots.splenocytes were prepared as described above. splenocytes were added to 96-well plates (1 × 10 6 cells/well) and stimulated for 6 h with mers-cov n-specific peptide (at 8 µg peptide/ml rpmi 1640 medium) in presence of the protein transport inhibitor brefeldin a (biolegend, san diego, ca, usa; 5 µg/ml). non-stimulated cells served as a background control and cells stimulated with 5 ng/ml pma and 500 ng/ml ionomycin or with f2l peptide (8 µg/ml rpmi 1640 medium) were used as positive controls. after stimulation, cell surface antigens were stained using pe-conjugated anti-mouse cd3 (clone: 17a2, biolegend, san diego, ca, usa), pe/cy7-conjugated anti-mouse cd4 statistical analysis was performed by t-test using graphpad prism version 5 software (graphpad software, san diego ca, usa); p-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.recombinant virus mva-mers-n was formed in cef that were infected with mva and transfected with the mva vector plasmid piiih5red-mers-n ( figure 1a ). the mva dna sequences in piiih5red-mers-n (flank-1, flank-2) targeted the insertion of the n gene sequences into the site of deletion iii within the mva genome. the clonal isolation was facilitated by co-production of the red fluorescent reporter protein mcherry allowing for the convenient detection of mva-mers-n infected cells during plaque purification. the repetitive dna sequence of flank-1 (fr) served to remove the marker gene mcherry from the genome of the final recombinant virus through initiating an intragenomic homologous recombination (marker gene deletion). after pcr analysis confirmed the presence of more than 95% mva-mers-n recombinant viruses in the cultures, we selected the final marker-free recombinant viruses by plaque purification and screening for plaques without mcherry fluorescence. to confirm genetic integrity and proper insertion of the heterologous n gene sequences within the mva-mers-n genome, we analyzed viral genomic dna by pcr using specific oligonucleotide primers specific for mva sequences adjacent to the deletion iii insertion site ( figure 1b in addition, the comparative western blot analysis of cell lysates from mva-mers-n or mva-mers-s infected cef with antigen-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies suggested the production of comparable amounts of both mers-cov candidate antigens (figure 2b ). this observation is in line with the fact that the mva-mers-s candidate vector vaccine expresses the mers-cov s gene sequences using the identical pmh5 promoter system [23] . as shown in previous studies, we detected two mers-cov s-specific protein bands upon infection with mva-mers-s indicating the authentic proteolytic cleavage of the full-length s glycoprotein (~210 kda) into an n-terminal (~120 kda s1 domain) and a c-terminal (~85 kda s2 domain; not detected) subunit [23, 50, 51] . following this, we used the total protein lysates from mva-mers-n or mva-mers-s infected cef to assess the recognition of the mers-cov n and s antigens by sera from experimentally mers-cov infected animals. the western blot analysis of sera from an infected rabbit (figure 2c ) or a cynomolgus monkey (figure 2d ) revealed the presence of antibodies specific for the mers-cov n protein. the recognition of the mers-cov n protein was at least as prominent as the mers-cov s antigen, which was suggestive of the induction of substantial n-specific antibody responses after experimental mers-cov infections.t cell responses against coronaviruses are known to be long lived and mostly target the more conserved cov internal structural n protein. however, information on mers-cov n antigen-specific t cell specificities is still limited. thus, we aimed first to identify n polypeptide-specific t cell epitopes in balb/c mice immunized twice with recombinant virus mva-mers-n or non-recombinant mva as a control via the intraperitoneal and intramuscular routes. eight days after the final immunization, splenocytes were prepared and the purified cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were restimulated in vitro with overlapping peptides corresponding to the n protein. overlapping peptides were pooled using a two-dimensional, pooled-peptide matrix system (table s1 ) and screened by ifn-γ elispot. the stimulation of splenoctyes from mva-mers-n immunized mice with the peptides from 16 out of the total 18 peptide pools did not result in the detection of ifn-γ producing t cells above background numbers obtained with splenocytes from mock or mva-control vaccinated animals. stimulation with the peptides from pools h8 (n = 10) and v8 (n = 10) as well as the use of the vaccinia virus positive peptide f2l [49] (data not shown) showed elevated numbers of ifn-γ spot forming cells (sfc) in cd8+ t cell cultures (figure 3a,b) . mva-mers-n immunizations given by i.p. and i.m. routes resulted in comparable t cell stimulatory capacities of overlapping n-specific peptides from pools v8 and h8. in contrast, peptides from other pools showed no or only minor stimulatory activities, as exemplified for peptides in pools v4 and v6. following this, the peptides within the v8 and h8 peptide pools were used to elucidate in more detail the t cell epitope specificities. we subdivided the peptides from h8 and v8 in four new pools each containing five peptides (h8.1, h8.2, v8.1, v8.2). in addition, we separately tested the two 15mer peptides #89 and #90, which were shared between pools h8 and v8. we again vaccinated balb/c mice with mva-mers-n using i.p. or i.m. inoculations in a prime-boost regime. splenocytes were prepared at day eight after the last vaccination and purified cd8+ t cells were restimulated with subpools v8.1., v8.2., h8.1, and h8.2 (figure 4a ). stimulation with peptides from pools v8.1 or h8.1 activated only minor levels of ifn-γ producing cells with mean levels about 23 sfc/10 6 splenocytes. yet, the stimulation with subpools v8.2 and h8.2 revealed clearly higher numbers of activated t cells with 83-176 ifn-γ sfc/10 6 splenocytes. comparable numbers of ifn-γ producing cells were again induced by i.p. or i.m. immunization. of note, the stimulations with the 15-mer peptides #89 (n353-367 = qnidayktfpkkekk) or #90 (n357-371 = ayktfpkkekkqkap) alone resulted in detection of substantial quantities of ifn-γ producing cells (mean levels about 71-107 sfc/10 6 splenocytes) in mice that had been vaccinated with mva-mers-n by both immunization routes (figure 4b ). cd8+ t cells purified from mice receiving non-recombinant mva or mock vaccine (pbs) did not produce ifn-γ following stimulation with peptides from subpools v8.1-h8.2 and with peptides #89 and #90. when checking for the specific peptides contained within the subpools, we observed that the strongly stimulatory peptides #89 and #90 were part of the subpools v8.2 and h8.2, whereas these peptides were absent in v8.1 and h8.1. this data suggested that the overlapping 15-mer peptides #89 and #90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of mers-cov n-specific cd8+ t cell responses. following this, the peptides within the v8 and h8 peptide pools were used to elucidate in more detail the t cell epitope specificities. we subdivided the peptides from h8 and v8 in four new pools each containing five peptides (h8.1, h8.2, v8.1, v8.2 ). in addition, we separately tested the two 15-mer peptides #89 and #90, which were shared between pools h8 and v8. we again vaccinated balb/c mice with mva-mers-n using i.p. or i.m. inoculations in a prime-boost regime. splenocytes were prepared at day eight after the last vaccination and purified cd8+ t cells were restimulated with subpools v8.1., v8.2., h8.1, and h8.2 (figure 4a ). stimulation with peptides from pools v8.1 or h8.1 activated only minor levels of ifn-γ producing cells with mean levels about 23 sfc/10 6 splenocytes. yet, the stimulation with subpools v8.2 and h8.2 revealed clearly higher numbers of activated t cells with 83-176 ifn-γ sfc/10 6 splenocytes. comparable numbers of ifn-γ producing cells were again induced by i.p. or i.m. immunization. of note, the stimulations with the 15-mer peptides #89 (n 353-367 = qnidayktfpkkekk) or #90 (n 357-371 = ayktfpkkekkqkap) alone resulted in detection of substantial quantities of ifn-γ producing cells (mean levels about 71-107 sfc/10 6 splenocytes) in mice that had been vaccinated with mva-mers-n by both immunization routes (figure 4b ). cd8+ t cells purified from mice receiving non-recombinant mva or mock vaccine (pbs) did not produce ifn-γ following stimulation with peptides from subpools v8.1-h8.2 and with peptides #89 and #90. when checking for the specific peptides contained within the subpools, we observed that the strongly stimulatory peptides #89 and #90 were part of the subpools v8.2 and h8.2, whereas these peptides were absent in v8.1 and h8.1. this data suggested that the overlapping 15-mer peptides #89 and #90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of mers-cov n-specific cd8+ t cell responses. to map more precisely this specific epitope within the mers-cov n protein, we concentrated on the overlapping 11-mer peptide shared between peptides #89 and #90 and obtained nine 8-10-mer peptides (table 1) . using these peptides for the stimulation of splenoctyes from mva-mers-n vaccinated mice, we obtained the highest numbers of ifn-γ producing t cells with peptide 10.2 (mean levels of 94 to 97 sfc/10 6 splenocytes), while the other peptides (10.1, 9.1, 9. the availability of appropriate mers-cov-specific immune monitoring tools is a prerequisite for the successful development of vaccines and therapeutic approaches. the development of these tools is hampered by the fact that we still know little about the relevant viral antigens and the overall pathogenesis of the mers-cov infection. recent studies describe a number of cases with asymptomatic mers-cov infection in humans and raise questions as to which factors influence the clinical manifestation of mers [52, 53] . since asymptomatic or mild clinical manifestations of mers-cov infection are often associated with low levels of seropositivity, the analysis of mers-cov-specific cellular immune responses may facilitate further insight into the immune correlates of disease prevention. moreover, in order to characterize the pathogenesis of mers-cov infection, it will be indispensable to monitor the role of virus-specific t cells in animal models of mers and to precisely identify the antigen specificities of these t cell responses.in the present study, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (mhc) haplotype h2-d restricted peptide epitope in the mers-cov n protein by stimulating t cells from mva-mers-n vaccinated balb/c mice with a 2-d matrix pool of overlapping peptides. these mice have already been used in various preclinical studies to establish the mers-cov s protein as an important vaccine antigen for induction of virus neutralizing antibodies [23, [40] [41] [42] 54] . moreover, balb/c mice transduced with the human cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hdpp4) using an adenovirus vector are susceptible to productive mers-cov lung infection, which allows for the testing of the protective efficacy of mers-cov-specific immunization using the mers-cov s protein [24, 40, 41, 43, 44] . here, we wished to specifically assess the suitability of an mva-delivered mers-cov n antigen for the activation of cellular immune responses in mice. in general, the n protein is a well conserved internal protein and the major structural component incorporating the viral rna within the viral nucleocapsid [55] . in previous studies, the sars-cov n protein has also been used as candidate antigen for vaccine development [56] , and an experimental dna vaccine efficiently induced sars-cov n-specific cellular immunity [57, 58] . in line with this data, recent studies in mers patients demonstrated that both antibody and t cell responses are associated with recovery from mers-cov infection [59] .the recombinant virus mva-mers-n produced stable amounts of mers-cov n antigen upon in vitro infection of human cells indicating the unimpaired expression of the target gene at the level of viral late transcription using the synthetic vaccinia virus-specific promoter pmh5 [46] . moreover, the mers-cov n antigen produced in mva-mers-n infected cells was strongly recognized by antibodies from experimentally infected laboratory animals suggesting that n-specific immune responses were potently activated upon mers-cov infection. it seems noteworthy that mers-cov productively replicates in rabbits, but viral loads are low and the animals develop no overt disease symptoms. however, haagmans et al. found infectious virus in the lung tissues of the rabbits and revealed the presence of the mers-cov n antigen in bronchiolar epithelial cells and in the epithelial cells of the nose [60] . the localization of n in these respiratory epithelial cells may result in an efficient recognition by innate and also adaptive immune cells similar to those described for other viruses inducing robust protective immunity [61] . this might be a possible explanation for efficient activation of mers-cov n-specific antibodies despite a barely productive mers-cov infection. similar outcomes of infection were observed upon mers-cov infection in cynomolgus macaques and other relevant non-human primate models [62, 63] . thus, the induction of n-specific immune responses in these animals emphasizes the potential usefulness of the mers-cov n protein to serve as vaccine antigen.nevertheless, the immunogenicity of n requires further characterization in preclinical models for mers-cov infection. in addition to the induction of mers-cov-specific antibodies, the mers-cov n protein holds promise to efficiently activate virus-specific cd8+ t cell responses. for more detailed studies characterizing the possible role of these t cell specificities in mers-cov-associated immunity or pathogenesis it is highly relevant to determine the n peptide epitopes allowing for the appropriate mhc-restricted antigen presentation and the activation of virus-specific t cells. in this study, we identified a new h2-d restricted cd8+ t cell epitope in the mers-cov n protein using a 2-d matrix and pools of 84 overlapping 15-mer n peptides. first, we have identified two mers-cov n derived peptides (n 353-367 = qnidayktfpkkekk and n 357-371 = ayktfpkkekkqkap) and further mapped these 15-mer peptides to the minimal aa sequence of n 358-367 = yktfpkkekk representing a decamer peptide epitope ( figure s1 ) [64] . analysis of mers-cov sequences reveals that n 358-367 is conserved among different strains of mers-cov (table s2 ) [65] . the availability of such an epitope may allow for more detailed experimental monitoring of cellular immune responses induced by a mva based candidate vaccine against mers-cov in the mouse model and potentially also in other preclinical models. of note, the h2-d restricted cd8+ t cell epitope enables characterization of t cell responses in balb/c mice that serve as a well-established mers-cov infection model following adenovirus vector mediated transduction with hdpp4 [24, 40, 41, 43, 44] . a particular feature of mers in humans, as observed upon the investigation of cluster outbreaks in hospitals, is the lack of detectable mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in patients with confirmed disease [66, 67] . this observation is attributed to the emergence of specific virus mutants evading the neutralizing antibody response, as already described for sars-cov [68, 69] . thus, future use of a t cell-specific immune monitoring might contribute to a more detailed understanding of mers pathogenesis. here, studies on the function of mers-cov-specific cd8+ t cells in this balb/c mouse mers-cov lung infection model will be helpful to better estimate the role of cellular immunity in vaccine mediated protection in mers-cov infection.finally, the mva-mers-n vector virus generated for this study proved to be a stable recombinant virus that can be readily amplified to obtain vaccine preparations technically fulfilling all requirements for further preclinical or even clinical development. future work with mva-mers-n candidate vaccines should help to elucidate the potential protective capacity of n-specific immune responses in mers-cov infections models and contribute to our better understanding of mers vaccine-induced protection.supplementary materials: the following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/10/12/718/ s1, table s1 : the

protein, table s2 coronaviruses (cov) are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov). in the last decades, six strains of coronaviruses were identified; however, in december 2019, a new strain has spread across wuhan city, china [1, 2] . it was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) by the world health organization (who) [3] . in late january 2020, who declared the outbreak a global pandemic with cases in more than 45 countries where the covid-19 was spreading fast outside china, most significantly in south korea, italy, and iran with over 2,924 deaths and 85,212 cases confirmed while 39,537 recovered on 29 february 2020, 06:05 am (gmt).covid-19 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus (+ssrna). its rna sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length [4] . it belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus and genus betacoronavirus within the family coronaviridae. the corona envelope (e) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as pathogenesis, envelope formation, assembly, and budding, alongside with its interactions with both other cov proteins (m, n, and s) and host cell proteins (release of infectious particles after budding) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .the infected person is characterized with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, diarrhea, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels or combination of all these within 3-6 days after exposure. further molecular diagnosis can be made by real-time pcr for genes encoding the internal rna-dependent rna polymerase and spike's receptor binding domain, which can be confirmed by sanger sequencing and full genome analysis by ngs, multiplex nucleic acid amplification, and microarray-based assays [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses is possible to reconstruct with a sufficient number of sequenced genomes. the phylogenetic analysis indicates that covid-19 likely originated from bats [15] . it also showed that it is highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor [16] .the sequence of covid-19 rbd, together with its rbm that contacts receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), was found similar to that of sars coronavirus. in january 2020, a group of scientists demonstrated that ace2 could act as the receptor for covid-19 [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . however, covid-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at the 2019-ncov receptor-binding motif (particularly gln493) which provide advantageous interactions with human ace2 [15] . this difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than other viruses.at present, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but chinese traditional medicines, such as shufengjiedu capsules and lianhuaqingwen capsules, could be possible treatments for covid-19. however, there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy for these drugs [22] .the main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself. although traditional vaccines, which depend on biochemical trials, induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized animals, they can be costly, allergenic, and timeconsuming and require in vitro culture of pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety [23, 24] . thus, the need for safe and efficacious vaccines is highly recommended.peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe, and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses [25, 26] . the core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized b-cell and t-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. a b-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked with a t-cell epitope to make it immunogenic.the t-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids), whereas the b-cell epitopes can be proteins [27, 28] . therefore, in this study, we aimed to design a peptidebased vaccine to predict epitopes from the corona envelope (e) protein using immunoinformatics analysis [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . rapid further studies are recommended to prove the effi-ciency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection.the workflow summarizing the procedures for the epitopebased peptide vaccine prediction is shown in figure 1 . act is an in silico analysis software for visualization of comparisons between complete genome sequences and associated annotations 2 biomed research international [35] . it is also applied to identify regions of similarity, rearrangements, and insertions at any level from base pair differences to the whole genome (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/ science/tools/artemis-comparison-tool-act).it is the first server for alignmentindependent prediction of protective antigens. it allows antigen classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins without recourse to sequence alignment. it predicts the probability of the antigenicity of one or multiple proteins based on auto cross covariance (acc) transformation of protein sequence. structural cov-2019 proteins (n, s, e, and m) were analyzed by vaxijen with threshold of 0.4 [36] (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/vaxijen/ vaxijen.html).it is a software package proposed to stream a distinct program that can run nearly any sequence operation as well as a few basic alignment investigations. the sequences of the e protein retrieved from uniprot were run in bioedit to determine the conserved sites through clustalw in the application settings [37] .mega (version 10.1.6) is software for the comparative analysis of molecular sequences. it is used for pairwise and multiple sequence alignment alongside construction and analysis of phylogenetic trees and evolutionary relationships. the gap penalty was 15 for opening and 6.66 for extending the gap for both pairwise and multiple sequence alignment. bootstrapping of 300 was used in construction of the maximum like hood phylogenetic tree [38, 39] (https://www .megasoftware.net).epitopes. iedb tools were used to predict the conserved sequences (10-mer sequence) from hla class i and class ii t-cell epitopes by using an artificial neural network (ann) approach [40] [41] [42] . the artificial neural network (ann) version 2.2 was chosen as the prediction method as it depends on the median inhibitory concentration (ic50) [40, [43] [44] [45] . for the binding analysis, all the alleles were carefully chosen, and the length was set at 10 before prediction was done. analysis of epitopes binding to the mhc class i and ii molecules was assessed by the iedb mhc prediction server at http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/ and http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/, respectively. all conserved immunodominant peptides binding to the mhc i and ii molecules at scores equal or less than 100 median inhibitory concentrations (ic50) and 1000, respectively, were selected for further analysis while epitopes with ic50 greater than 100 were eliminated [46] .population coverage for each epitope was carefully determined by the iedb population coverage calculation tool. due to the diverse binding sites of epitopes with different hla alleles, the most promising epitope candidates were calculated for population coverage against the population of the whole world, china, and europe to get and ensure a universal vaccine [47, 48] (http://tools.iedb.org/population/).modeling. the reference sequence of the e protein that has been retrieved from genbank was used as an input in raptorx to predict the 3d structure of the e protein [49, 50] ; the visualization of the obtained 3d protein structure was performed in ucsf chimera (version1.8) [51] .2.9. in silico molecular docking 2.9.1. ligand preparation. in order to estimate the binding affinities between the epitopes and the molecular structure of mhc i and mhc ii, in silico molecular docking was used. sequences of proposed epitopes were selected from the covid-19 reference sequence using ucsf chimera 1.10 and saved as a pdb file. the obtained files were then optimized and energy minimized. the hla-a * 02:01 was selected as the macromolecule for docking. its crystal structure (4uq3) was downloaded from the rcsb protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do), which was in a complex with an azobenzene-containing peptide [52] . all water molecules and heteroatoms in the retrieved target file 4uq3 were then removed. the target structure was further optimized and energy minimized using swiss pdb viewer v.4.1.0 software [53] .2.9.2. molecular docking. molecular docking was performed using autodock 4.0 software, based on the lamarckian genetic algorithm, which combines energy evaluation through grids of affinity potential to find the suitable binding the upper window represents the hcov-hku1 reference sequence, and its genes are highlighted in blue starting from orflab gene and ending with n gene. the middle window describes the similarities and the difference between the two genomes. red lines indicate a match between genes from the two genomes; blue lines indicate inversion which represents the same sequences in the two genomes, but they are organized in the opposite direction. the lower window represents covid-19 and its genes starting from orflab gene and ending with n gene. [54, 55] polar hydrogen atoms were added to the protein targets, and kollman united atomic charges were computed. the target's grid map was calculated and set to 60 × 60 × 60 points with grid spacing of 0.375 ǻ. the grid box was then allocated properly in the target to include the active residue in the center. the genetic algorithm and its run were set to 100. the docking algorithms were set to default. finally, results were retrieved as binding energies and poses that showed the lowest binding energies visualized using ucsf chimera.3.1. the artemis comparison tool. the reference sequence of the envelope protein was aligned with the hcov-hku1 reference protein using the artemis comparison tool as illustrated in (figure 2 ).server. the mutated proteins were tested for antigenicity using vaxijen software, where the envelope protein was found as the best immunogenic target in table 1 . bioedit. sequence alignment of the covid-19 envelope protein was done using bioedit software which shows total conservation across four sequences which were retrieved from china and the usa (figure 3) .to study the evolutionary relationship between all the seven strains of coronavirus, a multiple sequence alignment (msa) was performed using clustalw by mega software. this alignment the iedb website was used to analyze the 2019-ncov envelope protein for t-cell-related peptides. results show ten mhc class i-and ii-associated peptides with high population coverage (tables 2 and 3 ; figure 5 ). the most promising peptides were visualized using ucsf chimera software (figures 6(a) and 6(b) ).designing a novel vaccine is very crucial to defend against the rapid endless global burden of diseases [56] [57] [58] [59] . in the last few decades, biotechnology has advanced rapidly, alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccine design [60] . peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigenspecific b-and t-cells [25] . applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands [61] [62] [63] . this approach has been used frequently in saint louis encephalitis virus [64] , dengue virus [65] , and chikungunya virus [66] proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines. the covid-19 is an rna virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the dna viruses [67] . these mutations lie on the surface of the protein, which makes covid-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in a blind spot [68] .in our present work, different peptides were proposed for designing a vaccine against covid-19 ( figure 1 ). in the beginning, the whole genome of covid-19 was analyzed by a comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [69] . the artemis comparison tool (act) was used to analyze human coronavirus (hcov-hku1) reference sequence vs. wuhan-hu-1 covid-19. results obtained (figure 2) revealed extensive mutations among the tested genomes. new genes (orf8 and orf6) were found inserted in covid-19 which were absent in hcov-hku1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [70] . the high rate of mutation between the two genomes was observed in the region from 20,000 bp to the end of the sequence. this region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are the envelope (e) protein, nucleocapsid (n) protein, membrane (m) protein, and spike (s) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [71, 72] .these conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment between mers-cov and bat coronavirus [73] and analyzed in sars-cov [74] .the four proteins were then analyzed by vaxijen software to test the probability of antigenic proteins. protein e was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as shown in table 1 . a literature survey confirmed this result in which protein e was investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003 and, more recently, middle-east respiratory syndrome (mers) [71] . furthermore, the conservation of this protein against the seven strains was tested and confirmed through the use of the bioedit package tool (figure 3) .phylogenetic analysis is a very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship between strains. multiple sequence alignment (msa) was performed using biomed research international tree revealed that covid-19 is found in the same clade of sars-cov; thus, the two strains are highly related to each other ( figure 4) .the immune response of t-cells is considered a longlasting response compared to b-cells, where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [75] . vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated responses are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen. moreover, the cd8+ and cd4+ t-cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity [76] . thus, designing a vaccine against t-cells is much more important.choosing protein e as the antigenic site, the binding affinity to mhc molecules was then evaluated. the protein reference sequence was submitted to the iedb mhc predication tool. 21 peptides were found to bind mhc class i with different affinities (table 1) , from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (table 2; figure 5 ). 52 (table 2) , from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (table 3 ; figure 5 ). unfortunately, iedb did not give any result for b-cell epitopes; this might be due to the length of the covid-19 (75 amino acids). it is well known that peptides recognized with a high number of hla molecules are potentially inducing immune response. based on the aforementioned results and taking into consideration the high binding affinity to both mhc class i and ii, conservancy, and population coverage, three peptides are strongly proposed to formulate a new vaccine against covid-19.these findings were further confirmed by the results obtained for the molecular docking of the proposed peptides and hla-a * 02:01. the formed complex between the mhc molecule and the three peptides (yvysrvknl, slvkpsfyv, and lailtalrl) has shown peptide amino-and carboxyltermini forming one and three hydrogen bonds, respectively, at the two ends of a binding groove with mhc residues with the least binding energy -13.2 kcal/mol, -11 kcal/mol, and -11.3 kcal/mol, respectively (figures 6(c)-6(e)).although both flu and anti-hiv drugs are used currently in china for treatment of covid-19, chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently been found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against covid-19 [77, 78] ; nevertheless, more studies are required to standardize these therapies. in addition, there has been some success in the development of mouse models of mers-cov and sars-cov infection, and candidate vaccines where the envelope (e) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in the envelope (e) protein as candidates for covid-19. accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitope vaccine candidates against t-cells.extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered in the covid-19 strain using the comparative sequencing. in addition, a number of the mhc class i-and ii-related peptides were found to be promising candidates. among which, the peptides yvysrvknl, slvkpsfyv, and lailtalrl show high potentiality for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage. the t-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for covid-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically ensuring its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv) is a major pathogen of felidae. despite the extensive efforts taken in the past decades, development of the ''ideal'' live attenuated fipv vaccine was not successful yet.in the present study, we provide data of immunisation experiments with a recombinant fcov pair differing only in the truncation (pbfipv-df-2) or completion (pbfipv-df-2-r3i) of their orf3abc regions. in our previous in vivo studies, these viruses proved to show the characters of low virulent or avirulent fcov phenotypes, respectively. therefore, we hypothesised the ability of these viruses, as possible vaccine candidates, in conferring protection in specific pathogen free (spf) domestic shorthair as well as in conventional purebred british shorthair cats.in spf cats, after two oronasal and two intramuscular vaccinations with two weeks intervals, both vaccine candidates provided 100% protection against lethal homologous challenge with the highly virulent fipv df-2 strain. in contrast, the conventional purebred british shorthair cats did not develop protection when they were immunised with the same vaccination regimes. in these groups 100% of the pbfipv-df-2-r3i immunised animals developed antibody-dependent enhancement (ade). prolonged survival was observed in 40% of the animals, while 60% showed fulminant disease course.genetic and more probably immunological differences between the spf and non-spf purebred kittens can explain the different outcome of the vaccination experiment. our data highlight the diverse immune responses between spf and conventional cats and suggest a decisive role of previous infection by heterologous causative agents in the outcome of the vaccination against fip.ß 2013 the authors. published by elsevier b.v.fcov probably emerged via a double recombination process between type i fcov and type ii canine coronavirus (ccov) (herrewegh et al., 1998) . both serotypes occur in two pathotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (fecv) replicates in the lower portion of the intestinal tract, spreads by faecal-oral route, and its clinical appearance is characterised by mild or unapparent enteritis (pedersen et al., 1981; herrewegh et al., 1997) . in contrast, feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv) efficiently replicates in macrophages and monocytes, occurs sporadically but causes a highly lethal systemic granulomatous disease, feline infectious peritonitis (fip), which can manifest in either wet or dry form (addie and jarrett, 1992; de groot-mijnes et al., 2005) .although extensive efforts have been taken in the past decades, development of the ''ideal'' live attenuated fipv vaccine replicating in the body without clinical signs, and inducing protective immunity against fipv (pedersen, 1989) has not been crowned with complete success yet. vaccination with closely related heterologous live covs did not confer protection at all (barlough et al., 1984 (barlough et al., , 1985 stoddart et al., 1988; woods and pedersen, 1979) .similarly to inactivated and recombinant fcov subunit vaccines (reviewed in haijema et al., 2007) , immunisation with fecv, low-virulence fipv, or sublethal amounts of virulent fipv elicited only partial protection (pedersen and black, 1983; pedersen et al., 1984; pedersen and floyd, 1985) frequently leading to antibody enhancement of the disease (ade) and the so-called early death syndrome.currently, a temperature-sensitive strain of fipv is marketed worldwide with an ability to protect cats against fipv (gerber et al., 1990; gerber, 1995) but its efficacy is uncertain (mcardle et al., 1995; scott et al., 1995; fehr et al., 1997) . the most promising results were obtained with recombinant fipv mutants lacking the orf3abc or orf7ab regions that provided 100% and 80% protection after a lethal homologous challenge (haijema et al., 2004) , respectively. however, no follow-up studies using these vaccine candidates have been published so far.in the present study, we provide data of immunisation experiments with a recombinant fcov pair differing only in the truncation (pbfipv-df-2) and intactness (pbfipv-df-2-r3i) of their orf3abc regions (bá lint et al., 2012) . in previous in vivo studies using specific pathogen free (spf) cats, pbfipv-df-2 proved to be low virulent, shed only at limited titres in faeces, and was completely cleared by the immune system but elicited medium level immune response, while pbfipv-df-2-r3i showed active intestinal replication and faecal shedding, and it possessed completely avirulent phenotype (bá lint et al., 2013) . considering these advantageous characteristics of the two recombinant fcovs, we evaluated their innocuity and efficacy as vaccine candidates in conferring protection in spf as well as in conventional purebred british shorthair cats.felis catus whole foetus 4 (fcwf-4) cells were used for virus propagation, titration and virus neutralisation tests.the cell line was maintained as monolayer culture in dulbecco's modified eagle medium (sigma-aldrich, saint louis, mo, usa) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (fbs), 0.3 mg/ml glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin b, 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 1% non-essential amino acids (sigma-aldrich). the fipv df-2 strain was kindly provided by berndt klingeborn (sva, uppsala, sweden). the whole genome of fipv df-2 was cloned into the pbelobac 11 lowcopy vector that allows efficient intracellular production of the viral rna from the cdna by the cytomegalovirus (cmv) immediate-early promoter in order to gain the recombinant fcov pbfiv-df-2 (genbank accession number: jq408981.1). the originally truncated orf3abc of this virus was replaced with the intact orf3abc of a type i ''fcov-like'' canine coronavirus (ccov) reference strain elmo/02 to construct pbfipv-df-2-r3i (genbank accession number: jq408980.1) (bá lint et al., 2012).spf domestic shorthair iqhsdcpb kittens (isoquimen sl, barcelona, spain) and conventional british shorthair cats from a fcov negative hungarian cattery (regularly monitored for two generations) were used in the challenge experiments. the non-spf cats were originated from three non-related queens and two toms. kittens arrived at the facility at the age of 8-12 weeks. they were acclimated and used in the studies at the age of 14-18 weeks. the animals were kept in separate groups in a closed facility. their fcov negative status was checked with pcr and virus neutralisation tests. the absence of feline parvovirus (fpv), feline herpesvirus (fhv), feline calicivirus (fcv), feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) and feline leukaemia virus (felv) in the conventional cats was confirmed by pcr and/or elisa tests. for study purposes, the same group structure was established both for spf and conventional kittens such as two study groups (group 1 and group 2, each n = 5) and a control group (c-group, n = 2) were formed. kittens were inoculated oronasally (d0 and d14) and intramuscularly (d28 and d42) with 10 3 50% tissue culture infective doses (tcid 50 ) of the recombinant viruses pfipv-df-2 (group 1) and pfipv-fd-2-r3i (group 2), respectively. the vaccinated animals and unvaccinated controls were oronasally challenged (d56) with 10 3 tcid 50 of the parent virus fipv df-2. the whole clinical observation period of time was altogether 8 months long. during this time kittens were clinically examined on a daily basis. cats were scored for several clinical signs as described earlier (haijema et al., 2004) . briefly, scoring was based on depression (inactivity for three consecutive days, 1 point), anorexia (not eating for three consecutive days, 1 point), and neurological disorders (swaggering, 1 point) on a daily basis, while fever (40.1 8c, 1 point), jaundice (yellow plasma, 1 point), weight loss (loss of 2.5% of body weight per week, 1 point), and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count of <0.5 â 10 9 /l) was scored on weekly basis. kittens showing signs of terminal fip were euthanized in order to avoid unnecessary suffering, while healthy animals were exterminated at day 90 post-challenge (p.c.), followed by full post-mortem examination. all animal experiments were approved and supervised by the ethical and animal welfare committee of the national food chain safety office.all animals that died or were euthanized during the experiment were subjected to pathological examination. carcasses were dissected within two hours of the death. samples taken from spleen, kidney, liver, lung, brain and intestine were fixed in 8% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin wax. the blocks were sectioned at 4-6 mm and the sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin and examined under light microscope.to determine virus shedding, faecal and oropharyngeal swabs were taken at d3, d7, d10, d14, d21, d28, d35, d42, d49, d56, d62, d70 an d77 and placed in 500 ml of phosphate buffered saline (pbs 1â). after vortexing and 30 min incubation, the swabs were removed, and the extract was centrifuged at 1000 â g for 10 min to remove cell debris. the supernatant was collected and used for subsequent pcr.viral rna was purified using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit (qiagen, hilden germany). to measure the copy numbers of the genome of the recombinant fcov, a taqman assay targeting the 5 0 end of the fipv df-2 genome was applied (bá lint et al., 2012).serum samples were taken using vacuette 1 tube (greiner bio-one, germany) at the same days as faecal samples. for virus neutralisation (vn) assay, two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum from kittens (50 ml) were incubated for 1 h at 37 8c with equal aliquots of fipv df-2 (50 ml of 10 3.5 tcid 50 /ml). the viruses were then added to fcwf-4 cells showing 70% confluency in a 96-well plate, and incubated for 48 h, until the development of cytopathic effect. neutralising activity was determined by end-point dilution (shiba et al., 2007) .to study whether pbfipv-df-2 and pbfipv-df-2-r3i inoculation would protect cats against a homologous fipv challenge, vaccination and challenge experiments were performed. group 1 and group 2 cats were vaccinated oronasally twice with pfipv-df-2 and pbfipv-df-2-r3i (10 3 tcid 50 at d0 and d14), respectively.the in vivo characteristics of the recombinant viruses were similar to those of earlier experiments (bá lint et al., 2013) . cats in group 1 showed only early mild clinical signs including transient fever from d3 to d8, anorexia and slight lymphopenia (table 1) , while cats in group 2 showed neither any clinical signs typical of fip nor diarrhoea (table 1) .no oropharyngeal shedding of either pbfipv-df-2 or pbfipv-df-2-r3i was detected during the whole period of the immunisation experiments (data not shown). shedding of pbfipv-df-2 in faeces of group 1 was detected in four animals from d3 to d42 with very variable amounts close to the detection limit of the genomic quantitative rt-pcr (4.5 â 10 0 -4 â 10 1 fcov rna copies per ml faecal extract) (fig. 1) . group 2 cats began to shed pbfipv-df-2-r3i from d3, virus shedding peaked at d7 with 7.8 â 10 5 fcov rna copies per ml faecal extract, remained high until d14, then began to decrease until reaching 3.2 â 10 2 fcov rna copies per ml faecal extract at d49, and remained at this level until the end of the experiment (fig. 1) .no neutralising activity was detected at d0 in any cat sera. in contrast, by d28, all the group 1 cats had seroconverted and showed medium titres (1:160-1:640) of neutralising antibodies (fig. 2) . group 2 cats showed table 1 total clinical scores of spf cats after oronasal (d0 and d14) and parenteral (days 28 and 42) vaccination with pbfipv (group 1, n = 5) and pbfipv-df-2-r3i (group 2, n = 5). the unvaccinated controls (c-group, n = 2) were vaccinated with pbs.virus and animal no. only three animals seroconverted by d28, and their vn titres remained at low levels (1:80-1:160) compared with those of the group 1 cats (fig. 2 ).since level of the humoral immune response after oronasal vaccination with the recombinant viruses was relatively low, two intramuscular vaccinations (10 3 tcid 50 at d28 and d42) were applied. a control group (c-group) was mock vaccinated with pbs. similarly to the oronasal vaccinations, the intramuscularly inoculated kittens did not develop any signs fip (table 1) . no faecal virus shedding of pbfipv-df-2 of group 1 cats was detected, while faecal shedding of pbfipv-df-2-r3i from group 2 kittens continued at low level (fig. 1) . oropharyngeal shedding was not observed from any animal of the two vaccinated groups (data not shown). neutralising antibody titres raised in all group 1 animals after intramuscular vaccinations (from 1:160-1:640 to 1:640-1:2560, p = 0.067). interestingly, one group 2 animal did not seroconvert (the other's titres significantly raised from 1:80-1:160 to 1:320-1:1280, p = 0.023), and somewhat lower antibody values were obtained in four group 2 animals compared to group 1 (p = 0.51) (fig. 2) .at d56, all kittens were challenged oronasally with 10 3 tcid 50 of the virulent fipv df-2 strain, and were monitored for 6 months. the c-group cats showed severe clinical signs of fip starting on the second week ( table 2 ). the two kittens died at days 22 and 24 post-challenge (p.c.). the pathological and histopathological examinations revealed lesions characteristic of systemic, non-effusive fip.on the contrary, vaccination with both pbfipv-df-2 and pbfipv-df-2-r3i proved to be highly efficacious against lethal fipv challenge. group 1 and group 2 cats remained healthy (table 2) and survived for at least 6 months. the vn titres did not boost significantly after the table 2 total clinical scores of pbfipv (n = 5) and pbfipv-df-2-r3i (n = 5) vaccinated spf cats after challenge with fipv df-2 (n = 10) at d56. to study the efficacy of the vaccine candidates in field conditions, the above experiment with the same protocols was repeated using conventional cats. neither of the vaccinated kittens showed any signs of fatal fip (table 3) . the group 1 inoculated animals showed slightly stronger clinical signs than their spf counterparts including lymphopenia, which is a characteristic sign of early fipv infection, while only anorexia was observed in two of the group 2 kittens (table 3) . oropharyngeal virus shedding was not detected in any vaccinated cat (data not shown).faecal virus shedding of conventional cats was approximately 0.5 log 10 higher, more intense and of longer duration (14 days extended in pbfipv inoculated animals) compared with that of the spf animals (fig. 1) . neutralising antibodies were induced in all animals showing approximately one log 2 higher titres than was observed in the spf animals (fig. 2) .after challenge, all the control cats showed clinical signs of fip followed by death at day 19 and 21 p.c. similarly to the spf animals with a slightly faster development of the disease and earlier death ( table 4 ). the pathological findings were characteristic of systemic, non-effusive fip.vaccination with pbfipv-df-2 showed variable results against lethal fipv challenge. two group 1 cats (cat 1and cat 2) had slightly higher vn antibody titres (fig. 3) and developed fip later, from day 50-70 p.c, and died at days table 3 total clinical scores of conventional cats after oronasal (d0 and d14) and parenteral (days 28 and 42) vaccination with pbfipv (group 1, n = 5) and pbfipv-df-2-r3i (group 2, n = 5). the unvaccinated controls (c-group, n = 2) were vaccinated with pbs.virus and animal no.

characteristic fip lesions similar to those observed in the fulminant course of the disease. three cats of group 1 developed fip within a week (table 4) followed by death between days 16-20 p.c. the fulminant course of the disease in the majority of the vaccinated animals suggested at least partial adverse effect of vaccination instead of protection.in group 2 all animals developed fip within a week (table 4 ) followed by death between days 14-19 p.c. the exclusive fulminant course of the disease also indicated clear adverse characteristics of this vaccine candidate. in all perished animals showing fulminant fip, the vn titres elevated rapidly before death (fig. 2) .a number of scientific data indicate that fip is a consequence of a recent interspecies jump of coronavirus, considering the fact that this disease has not been seen before 1950 (reviewed in pedersen, 2009 ). the immunological aspects of fip are complex and have not been fully elucidated yet. fipv could negatively influence immune system intervening at several points. this virus variant is a highly virulent monocyte/macrophage pathogen causing systemic immune complex mediated infection (vennema et al., 1998; takano et al., 2008; chang et al., 2010) . these facts may explain why the acquired natural immunity in cats is rather limited against fipv and also why no efficacious vaccine is available against fipv despite the intensive efforts of academic and commercial researchers.in our study the same vaccination regime was applied on spf and conventional purebred british shorthair cats using a recombinant fcov pair differing only in the truncation (pbfipv-df-2) and intactness (pbfipv-df-2-r3i) of their orf3abc region. the in vivo evaluation of this virus pair showed that these viruses possess low virulent and avirulent phenotype, respectively (bá lint et al., 2013).the low and inconsistent level of faecal shedding observed in the present experiments following vaccination with the recombinant pfipv-df-2 is similar to that which was observed after the infection of orf3abc truncated fcovs (chang et al., 2010; pedersen et al., 2012) . seroconversion reached medium level after the two oronasal vaccinations, and it gradually elevated after the two intramuscular injections with the absence of antibody enhancement (ade) leading to fip. strong antibody response was induced in each group after completion of the vaccination regime, however, high booster effect was not observed between the four individual inoculations. to reach higher antibody titres or to elicit more significant booster effect, modification of the vaccination protocol and further experiments might be required.vaccination with pfipv-df-2 caused low level lymphopenia that proved to be transient and was not followed by a second wave of significant lymphoid cell decrease characteristic to the course of fatal fip. these, together with the lack of other adverse clinical signs are advantageous for the development of a safe vaccine.after the vaccinations with pbfipv-df-2-r3i, no clinical signs were observed, which confirmed the avirulent phenotype and the fecv characteristics of this recombinant fcov. faecal virus shedding was higher and detected for a prolonged period compared with that of the pfipv-df-2. this phenomenon is in accordance with previous findings that the intact orf3abc region is indispensable for enteric replication of fcov (chang et al., 2010; pedersen et al., 2012; bá lint et al., 2013) . high mutation frequency and recombination are common features of coronaviruses, which can lead to increased virulence of the attenuated strains used for vaccination. for this reason, the longer persistence and shedding of pbfipv-df-2-r3i after inoculation makes it a less favourable vaccine candidate than pfipv-df-2.low and inconsistent antibody response was observed subsequently after the two oronasal vaccinations with pbfipv-df-2-r3i, while the antibody level significantly increased after intramuscular inoculation to a level comparable to but clearly lower than that of the pbfip-df-2 vaccinated animals. the low and inconsistent initial antibody response may be the consequence of the intact orf3abc, which directs fcov replication to enterocytes and restricts it in macrophages (bá lint et al., 2012) .in the case of spf cats, both recombinant fcovs with truncated or complemented orf3abc protected 100% of the vaccinated animals against a homologous challenge with the highly lethal fipv df-2 strain. the antibody titres in these animals did not increase significantly after the challenge, showing the absence of uncontrolled fipv df-2 replication.non-spf and spf cats reacted physiologically very similarly to the identical vaccination regime, although some of the clinical parameters (fever, depression, anorexia) of the non-spf animals were somewhat different of those observed in spf cats. virus shedding and serological response levels were also slightly higher indicating more intensive virus replication and immune reaction.however, the most striking difference between the two experiments was that the vaccine candidates provided far less or no protection in purebred cats against the challenge of the fipv df-2 strain. in most of the cases the challenge led to ade and in all case to the development of severe symptoms of fip in non-spf animals, independently of the genetic characteristics of the applied vaccine candidates. ade pathomechanism is not an exclusive feature of fipv infection; it resembles to the ade-based dengue haemorrhagic shock syndrome, first described by peiris and porterfield (1979) . the same phenomenon was also observed in the case of flaviviruses, alphaviruses, lentiviruses, influenzaviruses, enteroviruses and measles virus (peiris and porterfield, 1979; porterfield, 1986; takeda et al., 1988; tamura et al., 1991; chen et al., 2013; iankov et al., 2013) . it is suspected that ade might be more severe by early fipv challenge after vaccination. however, the lack of development of fatal fip and ade among spf cats and the prolonged survival of two non-spf animals after 14 days challenge suggest that other biological factors could have as strong effect on the development of fip as early challenge.two pbfipv-df-2 vaccinated animals (originated from different litters but have common father) remained symptomless for weeks and their survival time was prolonged from the usual 3-4 weeks to 65-86 days after fipv df-2 challenge, which is rather unusual after infection. the course of their disease clearly differs from ade and it resembles to that of latent or sequestered infection by fipv, which can be reactivated by immunosuppressive agents, such as felv (pedersen, 1987) .in our previous pilot vaccine trials we used different dna and immune stimulating complex (iscom) vaccine candidates harbouring n, s and off7b genes/proteins in both spf (n = 15) and conventional cats (n = 15). applying fipv df-2 as a challenge strain, all the control and vaccinated animals perished within four weeks, with or without the signs of ade (farsang et al., unpublished result) . studies conducted by others are congruent with ours and indicate that virtually all cats develop fip within four weeks after fipv df-2 challenge (reviewed in pedersen, 2009 ). this is the first case when we observed long-term survival in our vaccination trials. it may be the consequence either of the slightly higher neutralising antibody titre of the two animals or it can be the result of the altered specificity of their immune response. the prolonged survival of 40% of the pbfipv-df-2 vaccinated cats makes pbfipv-df-2 a more promising candidate than pbfipv-df-2-r3i for further vaccine development.genetic and immunological differences between the spf and non-spf purebred kittens can explain the different outcome of the vaccination experiment. although more frequent occurrence of fip was reported from australia in certain breeds including british shorthair than in domestic shorthair cats (norris et al., 2005) yet the significant influence of the genetic background of the animals is less likely because we were not able to find any survival neither among domestic shorthair cat controls in the present experiment nor among vaccinated domestic shorthair cats from our earlier iscom or dna vaccination trials after fipv df-2 challenge.vaccination trials revealed that sub-neutralising level of spike protein-specific antibodies can lead to ade by facilitating fc receptor-mediated uptake of fcov by macrophages/monocytes contributing to the development of early death syndrome (weiss and scott, 1981; vennema et al., 1990; corapi et al., 1992; hohdatsu et al., 1998; olsen et al., 1992) . vaccination of the british shorthair cats with pbfipv-df-2 resulted in heterologous immunological response and survival times despite the common genetic background. these facts also suggest that immunity status has a more substantial role in the development of the disease course after vaccination than genetic background.spf kittens are bred in isolated circumstances, and they neither meet a range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic parasites, bacteria, fungi and viruses nor take up maternal antibodies in the colostrum against them, while non-spf animals kept even under the best circumstances do encounter with such microorganisms. the conventional purebred british shorthair cats developed higher vn antibody titres but these antibodies or their particular fraction might have led to the observed ade.although no direct connection between the feline bacterial flora and virus neutralising titre was published so far, abundant scientific data confirm the direct and indirect influence of the microbiota composition on the outcome of pathogenic infections (slifka et al., 2003; teixeira et al., 2008; wilks and golovkina, 2012) .the presence of intestinal microbes directly facilitates the infection of reoviruses and polioviruses, both in vitro and in vivo (kuss et al., 2011) . the bacterial flora promotes maturation of secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine (lee and mazmanian, 2010) and can influence both gene expression in antigen-presenting cells and the way t cells respond to vaccines (klaasen et al., 1993; lamousé -smith et al., 2011) . furthermore, interactions of macrophages with probiotic bacteria lead to increased antiviral response against vesicular stomatitis virus in vitro (ivec et al., 2007) . since fip is the result of type iii or iv hypersensitivity reaction (pedersen and boyle, 1980; paltrinieri et al., 1989) , it is tempting to speculate that the mature immune system of non-spf cats predisposes these animals to development of the disease.in summary, vaccination experiments showed that hyperimmunisation of spf cats with low virulent recombinant fcovs conferred complete protection against lethal homologous challenge. however, partial or no protection was observed using the same vaccination protocol in non-spf cats. these data highlight the diverse immune responses between spf and conventional cats and suggest a decisive role of previous infection by heterologous causative agents in the outcome of the vaccination against fip.all authors disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or

promotes the entrance of the virus into host cells. s protein is a major target for design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. the s protein has two domains, s1 and s2. the s1 domains contain the receptor binding domain (rbd) that mediates attachment to the host receptor cell, whereas the s2 domain facilitates the fusion of the virus to the host cell. the entry of sars-cov-2 into host cells initiated by binding of the rbd to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), the main receptor for sars-cov-2 on the host cells surface and cd209l is another receptor with lower affinity (7) . ace2 receptors expressed in type ii alveolar cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and in several immune cells. s2 subunit has a domain that facilitates the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. these domains are internal membrane fusion peptide (fp), a membrane proximal external region (mper), two 7-peptide repeats, and a transmembrane domain (tm). the s glycoprotein has a key role in the induction of immunity during infection with sars-cov-2 by eliciting neutralizingantibodies and t-cell responses. studies showed that the s protein has several immunodominant parts that do not induce neutralizing antibodies, but the rbd in the s1 region is a potent inducer of neutralizing antibodies. thus, full-length s glycoprotein, the s1 subunit, the rbd domain, ntd, and fp are proposed as the promising candidate to develop an effective vaccine against sars-cov-2 (7), (8) . the m-membrane protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein that gives a definite shape to the virus structure. it binds to nucleocapsid and organizes the virus assembly. the m protein contains t cell epitope clusters that elicit a neutralizing antibody in sars patients. the e protein has a key role in the pathogenesis, assembly, and release of the virus. the e protein inactivation modifies the virulence of covs due to changes in morphology and tropism. the n-nucelocapsid protein (which is within the phospholipid bilayer) has a key role in complex formation with viral genome, enhances m protein interaction during assembly, and increases replication of the virus. the e, s, and m proteins form the viral envelope (8), (9), (10).j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f cases. according to who guidelines infected patients treated with supportive care like bed rest, oxygen saturation, adequate nutrition, prevention of dehydration, keeping electrolyte and acid-base balance, antibiotics, and isolation of patients suspected or confirmed for covid-19 (12) . several pre-existing and potential drug candidates, including remdesivir, chloroquine, and others are considered. the therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for covid-19 include molecules binding to the virus, inhibiting enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, inhibitors targeting helicase and proteases, host cell protease inhibitors, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, anti-sense rna and ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mabs targeting host cell receptor or interfere with s1 rbd, antiviral peptide targeting s2, and natural products (13) .effective sars-cov-2 vaccines are crucial for controlling the covs pandemic. vaccines decrease disease severity, viral shedding, and person to person transmission. currently, no vaccine has been licensed to prevent sars-cov-2 infection (14) . there are different vaccine development platforms against sars-cov-2, including live attenuated virus, viral vectors, inactivated virus, subunit vaccines, recombinant dna, and protein vaccines. several studies are in progress, but requires months to years to develop the vaccines for sars-cov-2. currently, there may be many promising targets for sars-cov-2. covid-19 candidate vaccines under development include s protein or rbd subunit vaccines and replicating or non-replicating vector vaccines expressing mainly s protein or the rbd. several studies showed that viral s protein subunit vaccines displayed higher neutralizing antibody titers and protection than live-attenuated sars-cov, full, and dna-based s protein vaccines. collectively, s protein/gene is the preferred target site in sars vaccine development, and the same strategy can be potentially useful in developing sars-cov-2 vaccine (14), (15).live attenuated vaccine (lav) is the most immunogenic vaccines that do not require adjuvant to gain optimal response due to its effectiveness to provoke immunity mimic to the natural infection. the lav contain viable but attenuated live virus with low virulence property that does not cause disease in a person with normal immune systems. they reproduce slowly, and thus remain a continuous source of antigen for a long period after single immunization, reducing the need for booster dose (16) . several lavs are found in the market to protect various disease including mumps, rubella, measles and varicella vaccines. lav produced by passing virus in cell cultures, in animals or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing less virulent strains selection or by mutagenesis, or deletion of the viral genes that give virulence.lav is not suitable for infants, immune-compromised patients, and elderly people due to the risk of inactivated whole-virus comprises the entire disease-causing virion which is inactivated physically (heat) or chemically. it has several antigenic parts to the host and can induce diverse immunologic responses against the pathogen. inactivated whole-virus has several advantages, including low production cost, safe, and does not involve genetic manipulation. iwv is conventional vaccines with mature technology and may become the first sars-cov-2 vaccine put into clinical use (19) .there are three inactivated whole-virus vaccines against sars-cov-2 reached phase 1/2 clinical trial. these phase 1/2 clinical trials are done by the beijing institute of biological products (chictr2000032459), sinovac (nct04352608) and wuhan institute of biological products (chictr2000031809) (20).subunit vaccines contain pathogen-derived proteins (antigens) with immunogenicity that can elicit the host immune system. subunit vaccine is safe and easily manufactures by recombinant dna techniques but requires adjuvant to enhance a immune response. so far, many research institutions initiated the sars-cov-2 subunit vaccine, and use the spike glycoprotein s, and its fragments, such as s1, s2, rbd, and nucleocapsid protein as a prime target antigens as shown in table 1 (21) . novavax, inc. developed a candidate vaccine based on s protein. so far, clover biopharmaceuticals constructed a sars-cov-2 s protein trimer vaccine (s-trimer) by using its patented trimer-tag© technology (22) . since the rbd of s protein directly bind with the ace2 receptor on host cells, rbd immunization induces specific antibodies that may block this recognition and effectively prevent the invasion of the virus. most of sars-cov-2 subunit vaccines currently under development use rbd as the antigen. in a study in monkeys, recombinant rbd protein was used to successfully reduce viral loads in the lungs and oropharynx and to dna vaccines (dvs) have a plasmid into which a particular gene incorporated that encodes the antigens that identified from the pathogenic microorganism. the bacterial plasmid carrying the desired gene delivered into the host and translated the antigenic protein that stimulates the immune system normally activated by the pathogenic microorganism. dvs elicit both the cell-mediated and humoral immune genome. but, pre-existing immunity against human ad5 is widespread, hampering its use as a vector for vaccine development (35) . chimpanzee adenovirus (chadox1) represents an alternative to the human ad vector due to its safety and lack of preexisting immunity in humans (36) . mice immunized with the ad5 vector encoding the s protein-induced systemic neutralizing antibodies and mucosal t-cells immunity. ad5 vectors encoding the s1 domain of the s protein displayed stronger neutralizing antibody responses than that encoding the full length, suggesting the effect of immune focusing (37) . synthetic peptide vaccines have chemically produced from fragments of antigens that elicites the immune response. these vaccines are inexpensive, easy for preparation, and quality control. but display low immunogenicity, thus antigen modification and adjuvant required during formulation. fragments of j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f antigen has b_ and/or tepitope activity, which affect the specificity of the immune response. currently, a set of b and t cell epitopes isolated from s and n proteins of sars-cov, these epitopes are highly conserved in sars-cov-2 and may assist efforts to develop vaccine for covid-19 disease (39) . several pharmaceutical companies like generex biotechnology developing peptide based vaccines against sars-cov-2 viruses by producing synthetic peptides that mimic crucial antigens from a virus that is chemically bonded to the 4-amino acid ii-key to ensure robust immune system activation (40). over the past two decades, outbreaks of novel and re-emerging infectious diseases, particularly caused by zoonotic viruses, have prompted an international push to develop strategies addressing research, nonclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, and regulatory evaluation that can increase the rapidity of medical countermeasure development to control outbreaks and prevent resurgence of those diseases. most recently, the emergence of a novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2, and its explosive disseminationresulting in a global disease pandemic (termed "coronavirus disease 2019", or covid-19) that, as of late april 2020, is associated with almost 3.1 million confirmed infections and 220,000 deaths 1 -has prompted an unprecedented response from the scientific and public health communities to develop therapies and vaccines. the publicly stated timeframes of 12-18 months for availability of licensed vaccines targeted against sars-cov-2 are optimistic, but would have been considered fantastic even a decade ago.in response to other recent global public health emergencies, such as the 2014-2015 ebola virus epidemic in west africa and the widespread emergence of zika virus in 2015-2016, several national and international health policy and funding agencies have prepared lists of priority pathogens considered to have potential to cause pandemic disease, and promoted the development of platform technologies that can speed the production of new vaccines against those agents, or against a previously unidentified emerging pathogen, often termed "disease x".one such group of platform technologies that is considered by many to be a key component of rapid vaccine development are nucleic acid vaccines, in which the genetic sequences for potentially immunogenic and protective antigens from the pathogen are delivered as dna or rna molecules. compared with more established approaches for immunization using injection of live attenuated or inactivated pathogens, or protein subunits of those pathogens, nucleic acid-based approaches offer several advantages for rapid response including rapid adaptability, simpler manufacturing processes, enhanced physical stability, and robust safety 2,3 . in addition, they may benefit from simplified requirements for nonclinical safety evaluation when alternative novel sequences are inserted into a previously well characterized platform construct. some questions remain regarding the immunogenicity of nucleic acid vaccines compared with other more traditional vaccine approaches, but significant efforts have been made to address those through optimization of vaccination routes and timing of doses, and the use of vehicles and devices that facilitate uptake of the nucleic acid by host cells, resulting in improved performance of this class of vaccines in large animal models and in clinical use 2,3 .concurrent with facilitating new approaches and technologies that may speed vaccine development, the who's r&d blueprint for action to prevent epidemics has identified alignment of regulatory expectations for the testing and evaluation of novel vaccine candidates as a key enabler for effective outbreak responses 4 . in 2005, who developed "guidelines for assuring the quality and nonclinical safety evaluation of dna vaccines" 5 and, based on the subsequent progression of several dna vaccines to clinical evaluation and increasing awareness of the potential utility of dna vaccines in outbreak responses, initiated a process for revision of those guidelines in february, 2018 from which a draft was publicly disseminated in mid-2019 for comment 6 . the revised guidelines focus on biologically manufactured bacterial plasmid dna for use in humans, and address aspects related to control of manufacture and characterization, approaches to nonclinical and clinical testing, and information that may be required by national regulatory authorities for approval of clinical trials or licensure. the revised guidelines are considered unlikely to be applicable to rna vaccines, and development by who of separate document(s) covering rna vaccines is in progress 6 . in this issue of npj vaccines, sheets et al. provide an overview of the revision process to date, report the outcomes from an informal consultation of subject matter experts held in december, 2019 to review the draft revisions and discuss public comments that had been received, and describe the timeline for further revision and subsequent approval and implementation of the new guidelines by the who expert committee on biological standardization during 2020.this communication is timely, given the current global impacts of covid-19 and the rapid development of a large number of candidate vaccines, including several based on dna or other nucleic acid platforms. at the time of this report (late april, 2020), and only 2-3 months following initiation of their development, a candidate dna vaccine (clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct04283461) and a candidate rna vaccine (nct04336410) are in phase 1 clinical trials, and more than a dozen other nucleic acid vaccine candidates are in development 7 . for the two vaccines now in phase 1, it seems that the rapid path to clinical testing was facilitated by both the short timelines for manufacturing of initial clinical lots and streamlined requirements for nonclinical safety testing based on prior nonclinical and clinical experience with those platforms 7, 8 . evaluation of vaccine efficacy in newly developed animal models for covid-19 can be expected to proceed in parallel with clinical safety testing. vaccine development against sars-cov-2 is benefiting from prior experience with other closely related emerging coronaviruses associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). currently there are no licensed vaccines for coronaviruses that cause respiratory diseases in humans, and induction of robust and durable protective immunity against infection by sars-cov-2 through vaccination may be challenging. furthermore, the outcomes of nonclinical efficacy testing of some candidate vaccines for sars and mers suggests that another significant concern is the potential for immune potentiation of covid-19 lung disease [8] [9] [10] [11] . the anticipated demand for hundreds of millions of doses for sars-cov-2 vaccines and their use in a wide range of target populations, coupled with the likely limitations of manufacturing capacity and scalability for any single vaccine type, suggests that engagement and coordination of multiple international partners for development of a portfolio of licensed vaccines based on multiple platforms will ideally be needed 12 .the current covid-19 pandemic will provide nucleic acid vaccine platforms their greatest opportunity to demonstrate in practice their proposed value as key components in the rapid response to controlling global or regional emerging infectious disease threats. the availability of the revised who guidelines related to dna vaccines, currently as a draft and subsequently in a final form, should facilitate communications between vaccine developers and regulatory agencies as nucleic acid vaccine candidates progress towards possible licensure.received: 4 may 2020; accepted: 14 may 2020;porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) is a coronavirus that causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (ped) in pigs. its high mortality rate for piglets, at 90-95% (stevenson et al. 2013 ) is a key distinguishing factor between pedv and the similar transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in suckling piglets, the pedv incubation period is around two days, varying from 1 to 8 days. diarrhea and vomiting can develop within 24 h, and as a result dehydration, anorexia and severe weight loss occur. in older pigs and sows, morbidity varies, and the period between onset and end of clinical symptoms is 3-4 weeks (lee 2015; stevenson et al. 2013 ).the first known pedv outbreaks occurred in europe in the 1970s and 1990s, including in belgium (pensaert and de bouck 1978) and hungary (nagy et al. 1996) . while pedv has since posed less of a threat to europe, it has re-emerged in italy (martelli et al. 2008) , germany (hanke et al. 2015) , and france (grasland et al. 2015) affecting pigs of all ages. pedv spread to asia in the early 1980s, where it was first detected in japan in 1982, and then in south korea, china, and thailand (chen et al. 2014) . since october 2010 china has seen a severe outbreak of pedv, resulting in high porcine mortality rates and economic losses (sun et al. 2012) . pedv was first detected in the united states (u.s.) in may 2013 (stevenson et al. 2013 ) and then in canada in january 2014 (ojkic et al. 2015) . these two countries have experienced severe economic losses due to the death of millions of suckling piglets and to diarrhea-derived weight loss in fattening pigs (chen et al. 2014) . the north american serotypes are most closely related to a recently emerged chinese serotype (huang et al. 2013 ) and since the north american epidemic, they have spread to south korea, taiwan, and japan (lee 2015) .while a few vaccines are available against pedv, those targeting the asian strains are not effective against the north american strains, while the effectiveness of a conditionally approved vaccine in the u.s. is unknown (see below). by vaccinating sows with an effective vaccine, the suckling piglets can receive lactogenic immunity through iga antibodies secreted into the milk (bae et al. 2003) , and may be spared from vertical transmission of pedv from sow milk (sun et al. 2012 ).pedv primarily enters pigs' bodies through the fecal-oral route, although airborne transmission may play a role (alonso et al. 2014) . diarrhea and vomiting result in the spread of pedv through contaminated environmental sources including pigs, trailers, clothing (lowe et al. 2014 ), sow's milk (sun et al. 2012) , feed, and feed-supplements such as spray-dried porcine plasma (pasick et al. 2014) , highlighting the importance of biosecurity.pedv causes sickness through its actions in the intestines of pigs. the virus enters porcine enterocytes, which line the inner surface of the intestines, via interaction between the viral s protein and the enterocyte aminopeptidase n which acts as a cellular receptor for pedv. through this receptor pedv enters the enterocyte cells, where new virions assemble by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus membranes (ducatelle et al. 1981; li et al. 2007) .once pedv enters enterocytes it causes them to undergo acute necrosis (jung et al. 2014) . pedv also causes a reduction in the number of goblet cells, the cells which secrete mucins to defend against microbial infection (jung and saif 2015) . cytolysis additionally leads to shortening and severe atrophy of intestinal villi, and causes the tips of villi to erode or become covered with attenuated epithelial cells (jung et al. 2014; stevenson et al. 2013) . the atrophy of intestinal villi results in microscopic lesions, which are typical of an enteritic infection, (sueyoshi et al. 1995) . pedv also results in swollen cells, and the detachment of cells from adjacent cells and from the membranes of the basal surfaces (stevenson et al. 2013) . these factors inhibit the pig's ability to absorb water and nutrients, and result in the malabsorption and diarrhea discussed above.to produce an effective vaccine against pedv, it is important to understand the structure of the virus. the coronavirinae subfamily consists of three genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus. pedv is an enveloped alphacoronavirus encoded by a 28 kilobase single-stranded, positive-sense rna genome (song and park 2012) . coronaviruses have the largest known rna genomes of all viruses (king 2011) . the pedv genome has seven open reading frames (orfs), which code for three non-structural polyproteins, and four structural proteins [spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m) and nucleocapsid (n) ]. these open reading frames are flanked by a 5′ cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail (figs. 1 and 2) (song and park 2012) . the orfs encoding the non-structural proteins consist of two overlapping open reading frames, orf1a and orf1b, encoding two polyproteins. these polyproteins are processed by three virus-encoded proteases, a 3c-like proteinase (3clpro) and two papain-like proteinases (plp) which results in 16 non-structural proteins required for genome replication and mrna transcription (john et al. 2016; prentice et al. 2004 ). the accessory protein orf3 is a potassium ion channel, but its role is not well defined (wang et al. 2012) . reports on transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (tgev), another alphacoronavirus, indicate that s and e are only present in the virion in small quantities, with e estimated to occur 20 times in a virion (godet et al. 1992) . n and m occur in higher numbers, at a ratio of 1n:3m (king 2011) . a recent study examining mouse hepatitis virus (mhv, a betacoronavirus), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (sars-cov, a betacoronavirus), and feline coronavirus (fcov, an alphacoronavirus), has determined that coronaviruses have approximately 1100 m dimers, 90 s trimers, and n proteins in a ratio from 3m:1n to 1m:1n (neuman et al. 2011) . thus, m is the most abundant structural protein displayed at the viral surface.of the four structural proteins, s and m are the most antigenic. to date, the s protein has been the primary focus of subunit vaccine design due to its antigenicity, and the role it plays in viral entry, as it regulates interactions with host cell receptor protein, aminopeptidase n (bosch et al. 2003) . s contains three antigenic regions. the first epitope that was recognized spans amino acids 1495-1913. called the co-26k equivalent (coe), this epitope induced a neutralizing immune response and was identified through sequence homology with tgev, which induces similar clinical symptoms in pigs (chang et al. 2002) . subsequently, the motif spanning fig. 1 a schematic of the genome of pedv. the first two orfs from the 5′ end of the genome cover two thirds of the genome, and code for polyprotein 1a and polyprotein 1b, respectively. the next part of the genome codes for the s protein, then orf3, e, m, and finally the n protein (khamis 2016) amino acids 1368-1374, and the epitope region from amino acids 636-789 have also been found to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies (cruz et al. 2008; sun et al. 2006) .while s is antigenic, the use of s as a subunit vaccine poses challenges. s has been shown to be prone to mutations through serial passages (sato et al. 2011) , and has high genetic variability among pedv strains-strains have even been found with 582 nucleotide deletions in the s gene (masuda et al. 2015) . indeed, the variability of s makes it the gene of choice to study the genetic relatedness of different pedv strains (chen et al. 2014) . the difference in amino acid sequence between the s protein of different strains can lead to different epitopes being presented, and may explain why previous vaccines have failed to provide effective immunity against infectious strains (sun et al. 2012) .nonetheless, due to the early recognition of the antigenic importance of the protein, pedv recombinant protein production has focussed on s. work has been done to produce s or s epitopes in escherichia coli (van noi and chung 2017), lactobacillus casei (ge et al. 2012) , and via the orf virus as a vaccine delivery vector (hain et al. 2016 ). however, most recombinant pedv s production has occurred in plants, with all of these plants producing s-coe. the protein yield has varied widely, as has the plant host utilized. historically, tobacco has been the most established and developed platform for high-yield plant-based recombinant protein production (conley et al. 2011 ). as such, it follows suit that five of the fourteen reports of s-coe production were carried out using tobacco ( table 1) . four of the reports expressed s-coe in a stable transgenic line, with yields between 0.1% of tsp (kang et al. 2005b ) and 2.1% of tsp, depending on codon optimization (kang et al. 2005a) , while one reported transient production at 5% of tsp (kang et al. 2004 ). many of the alternative plant choices resulted in yields that were either not quantified, or very low, despite often using the same promoters and enhancers as the tobacco studies. like the tobacco studies, a double-enhanced 35s (2x35s) cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) promoter was used in carrot and potato the use of fusion proteins, particularly the heat-labile enterotoxin b subunit of escherichia coli (ltb), have recently gained popularity in subunit vaccine design, and have been utilized in the production of s-coe. three studies have expressed such fusions in rice, which has shown promise in reaching equivalent accumulation levels as tobacco. rice was used to express s-coe both in the endosperm and in calli. while accumulation levels in the calli using the rice a-amylase 3d promoter (ramy3d) only reached 0.083% for a s-coe-m cell-targeting ligand (co1) fusion (huy et al. 2012) , accumulation levels in the endosperm for ltb-s-coe using the wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunit bx17 endosperm-specific promoter (hmw-bx17-p) and rice actin first intron (act1-i) reached 1.3 and 1.9% (oszvald et al. 2007; tamás 2010) . ltb-coe has also been produced in tobacco, reaching comparative levels of 1.6% tsp (kang et al. 2006) .so far, only three studies have tested the immunogenicity of plant-produced s-coe. ltb-s-coe produced in tobacco was able to bind to the gm1-ganglioside intestinal membrane receptor (kang et al. 2006 ). more directly, mice orally immunized with co1-s-coe fusion protein produced in rice calli had threefold and eightfold higher levels of igg and iga secreting cells in their lymphocytes, respectively, compared to unimmunized mice (huy et al. 2012) . while this is encouraging, in order for a vaccine to be effective, the antibodies produced must be virus-neutralizing. bae et al (2003) took this next step, showing that feeding ground lyophilized transgenic tobacco containing s-coe was able to induce an immune response in mice that could inhibit pedv plaque formation by 49.7% in comparison to controls. while full immunity was not conferred by the mounted immune response, this study marks the most significant achievement to date in plant-based pedv vaccine research.m is the other antigenic protein of pedv, and the most abundant component of the viral envelope (utiger et al. 1995) . in contrast to s, m is more conserved, showing 5.5% the number of mutations as s after 100 serial passages (chen et al. 2014; sato et al. 2011) . the use of a protein that remains stable is important for subunit vaccine design to ensure that a vaccine can be used for a wide variety of strains and locations. the m protein of tgev and sars-cov show virus-neutralizing activity in the presence of complement, the component of the immune system that enhances the ability of antibodies to clear pathogens. this virus-neutralizing activity was demonstrated to be higher or comparable to the neutralizing capacity of 8 individual s protein fragments (pang et al. 2004; woods et al. 1988) .through sequence homology with infectious bronchitis virus (ibv, a gammacoronavirus), m was found to have a b-cell epitope on its c-terminus from amino acids 195-200 (zhang et al. 2012) . however, it is likely that with further research sequence homology studies will find more epitopes on pedv m. for example, the m protein of sars-cov has b-cell epitopes on the n and c-termini (he et al. 2005) , and two cytotoxic t-cell epitopes in the second and third transmembrane domain (liu et al. 2010) , while the m protein of mhv has a cd4+ t-cell epitope on its c-terminus (xue et al. 1995) .expression of m transiently in n. benthamiana as a fusion with elastin-like polypeptide (khamis 2016) resulted in the production of virus-like particles (vlps), an important development of subunit vaccine design. while subunit vaccines have previously failed to completely protect piglets from pedv infection due to subpar immunogenicity, vlps are more immunogenic because they resemble the native structure of the virion. plant-made vlps for influenza are shown to induce four-to six-fold higher levels of antibody response than fifty times more flu antigen not in vlps (d'aoust et al. 2008) . the ability to produce pedv vlps using m may lead to the first commercial plant-produced pedv vaccine.much of the pedv vaccine research has occurred in asia, where outbreaks have been most severe, but none of the produced vaccines are completely effective against asian pedv strains (song and park 2012) . available asian vaccines are based on strains that are genetically different from those sequenced in the u.s. that are currently causing epidemics globally (huang et al. 2013 ). this has been on display in china, where vaccinated herds experienced pedv breakouts that were found to be due to newer strains of the virus . two pedv vaccines were given conditional licenses in the u.s. by the united states department of agriculture (usda). the first was a vaccine originally produced by harrisvaccines, inc. , and is based on their sirravax sm rna platform. using this platform, part of the rna genome of a venezuelan equine encephalitis alphavirus is replaced with a gene for pedv s protein. after injection with genetic material, the pig's dendritic cells produce the s protein and an immune response is launched against the produced protein (harrisvaccines, 2015) . merck animal health acquired harrisvaccines in 2015 (merck animal health 2015 but the product is still sold under a conditional license in the u.s., where safety and field trials are ongoing. the second conditionally licensed pedv vaccine in the u.s. is an inactivated virus particle vaccine produced by zoetis, inc. (zoetis 2016) . efficacy and potency studies are still in progress for the zoetis vaccine, and duration of immunity has not been evaluated. it must be refrigerated, and used all at once when opened (zoetis 2016) . a third vaccine candidate is being developed by vido-intervac (vaccine and infection disease organization-international vaccine centre) in canada and is currently undergoing field testing. this vaccine candidate is a subunit s1 protein expressed in mammalian hek-293 t cells, and although it induced production of neutralizing antibodies, it was not fully protective to suckling piglets (makadiya et al. 2016 ).none of the pedv vaccines used commercially, at least in the u.s. and canada, are made in planta. the ability to vaccinate orally through feeding plant tissue is important as (song et al. 2007 ) demonstrated that oral vaccination was more effective than injection for their pedv vaccine. when comparing oral to intramuscular administration of their attenuated virus vaccine, song et al. found that more iga's were produced by orally vaccinated pigs, and that the mortality rate for this group was 13% in comparison to 60% for the intramuscular group. current vaccines on the market are also either based on s, which is prone to mutations, or are killed or live attenuated vaccines. live attenuated vaccines present risks, as they can potentially mutate and become pathogenic again, and allow for genome segment re-assortment on farms-one chinese pedv strain is thought to have evolved from a live attenuated vaccine (chen et al. 2010) . inactivated vaccines, in comparison, are safer, but have a high cost of production, and present concerns over the reliability of inactivation methods (calvo-pinilla et al. 2014 ). both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines rule out the possibility of using "distinguish infected from vaccinated animals" (diva) assays, as they contain the entire virus. as such, the market has a need of an effective subunit vaccine based on the current infectious strains. further research on current plant-made candidates could prove to fill this need.while proof of concept studies show that s-coe can be produced in plants, many of these studies show poor yields. generally, even when higher yields are reported, the push forward to testing the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates does not occur. there have been two instances where the direct immunogenicity of plant-produced s-coe has been tested. the first was incomplete, as it did not test whether the mounted immune response was virus-neutralizing (huy et al. 2012) . the other candidate that successfully took steps to test immunogenicity was the vaccine candidate produced by (bae et al. 2003) . however, while the immune response in mice inhibited pedv plaque formation by 49.7% in comparison to controls, complete immunity was not achieved (bae et al. 2003) . likely due to this, and due to the need for higher expression levels, no further efforts were made with this vaccine candidate.generally, even when higher expression levels have been obtained (kang et al. 2004 ), immunogenicity was not tested, and research focused on increasing expression levels and not on producing an immunogenic commercial product. the focus on s-coe has left a gap in the research on plant production of other pedv proteins. however, our recent results have shown that m can be produced in planta and that vlps can be produced for pedv (khamis 2016) . vlps represent a step-forward for subunit vaccine design, demonstrating higher immunogenicity than regular subunit vaccines. in the future, advances in subunit vaccine design, such as vlps, and a commitment to improving yields and testing immunogenicity and protective immune responses to these vlps may lead to the commercialization of a plant-produced subunit pedv vaccine.the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) is a member of the coronaviridae family and emerged in 2012 in the kingdom of saudi arabia (zaki et al., 2012) . coronaviruses typically cause mild infections of the upper respiratory tract, but already in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome cov (sars-cov) with a mortality rate of about 10% among infected patients was introduced in the human population. sars-cov spread world-wide and caused more than 8000 diagnosed infections, but was contained within a year after its emergence (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/ en/).in contrast, infections with mers-cov are ongoing for more than 5 years, with 2103 laboratory-confirmed cases distributed over 27 countries with at least 733 deaths that were reported to the who by november 2017 (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). this apparent case-fatality rate of 35% is of grave concern, because epidemic spread as has been observed for sars-cov could result in a disastrous death toll. mers-cov has been introduced zoonotically by transmission from dromedary camels to human patients (alagaili et al., 2014; haagmans et al., 2014; reusken et al., 2013a) and serological studies indicate wide-spread and early distribution among this animal host (alagaili et al., 2014; reusken et al., 2013b) . therefore, a continuous risk of transmission especially to persons in close contact to camels is evident. fortunately, the human to human transmission rate has remained low. aside of individuals with regular contact to camels, only health care workers or relatives of mers-cov patients have a considerable risk of infection (alraddadi et al., 2016; drosten et al., 2014) , but still at a modest level. nonetheless, the high case fatality rate, the recurrent outbreaks of mers-cov infections, and especially the risk of virus adaptation potentially resulting in epidemic or even pandemic spread make the development of an effective vaccine against mers-cov an international priority.the efficacy of several vaccine candidates has been demonstrated in different animal models up to even dromedary camels (reviewed in (okba et al., 2017) ). one of these candidates, mv vac2 -mers-s(h) (malczyk et al., 2015) , is based on the measles virus (mv) vaccine platform technology (mühlebach, 2017) , and encodes the mers-cov spike protein (s) as an additional antigen in the backbone of recombinant mv vac2 (del valle et al., 2007) resembling vaccine strain moraten that is authorized and in use in the us since 1968. this candidate induces both robust humoral and functional cellular immuneresponses against mers-cov. moreover, mers-cov viral load and inflammation of the lung were significantly reduced in challenged mice that had been vaccinated with mv vac2 -mers-s(h), before (malczyk et al., 2015) .while these experiments provided proof of concept for efficacy of this vaccine candidate, further mechanistic insights into the nature of the induced t cell responses remain to be elucidated. these are of special interest, since it has been shown that t cells are essential for clearance of the infection (coleman et al., 2017; zhao et al., 2014) : depletion of cd8 + t cells increased overall inflammation, bronchiolar inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration, and pleuritis at day 7 post-infection in mice (coleman et al., 2017) , while mers cov-susceptible mice depleted of all t cells were unable to clear the virus . as an alternative to the spike glycoprotein, conserved (internal) structural proteins such as the nucleocapsid protein n are of special interest as putative target of anti-viral t cell responses to be triggered by future mers vaccines .therefore, we have also generated and characterized mers-cov n protein-encoding vaccine candidates based on the mv vac2 vaccine platform, in this study. to further characterize the induction of mers cov-specific immune responses, we first analyzed the necessity for viral replication for the induction of mers cov-and mv-specific immune responses using the highly immunogenic mv vac2 -mers-s(h) vaccine candidate. in addition, we characterized the functionality of cd8 + and cd4 + t cell responses in juvenile (6-12 week old) and adult (7 months of age) mice using flow cytometry and functional assays.vero (african green monkey kidney) (atcc# ccl-81) and 293 t (atcc crl-3216) cell lines were purchased from atcc (manassas, va, usa) and cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem, biowest, nuaillé, france) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs; biochrom, berlin, germany) and 2 mm l-glutamine (l-gln; biochrom). jawsii dendritic cells (atcc crl-11904) were purchased from atcc and cultured in mem-α with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (gibco brl, eggenstein, germany) supplemented with 20% fbs, 2 mm l-gln, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (biochrom), and 5 ng/ml murine gm-csf (peprotech, hamburg, germany). dc2.4 murine dendritic cells (shen et al., 1997) were cultured in rpmi containing 10% fbs, 2 mm l-gln, 1% non-essential aminoacids (biochrom), 10 mm hepes (ph 7,4), and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (sigma-aldrich, steinheim, germany). cells were cultured at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 6% co 2 for a maximum of 6 months of culture after thawing of the original stock.the codon-optimized gene encoding mers-cov-n (genebank accession no. jx869059) flanked with aatii/mlui binding sites in plasmid pma-rq-mers-n was obtained by gene synthesis (invitrogen life technology, regensburg, germany). the antigen and the immediate early cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter (martin et al., 2006) were inserted into plasmids p(+)br-mv vac2 -atu(p) (del valle et al., 2007) or p(+)mv vac2 -gfp(h) via mlui/aatii and sfii/sacii, respectively, to generate p(+)polii-mv vac2 -mers-n(p) or p(+)polii-mv vac2 -mers-n (h). for construction of lentiviral transfervectors encoding mers-cov-n, the orf of mers-n was amplified by pcr with primers encompassing flanking restriction sites nhei/xhoi and template pma-rq-mers-n. details on primers and pcr are available upon request. pcr products were cloned into pcr2.1-topo (invitrogen life technology) and fully sequenced. intact antigen orf was cloned into pcscw2gluc-ires-gfp (hewett et al., 2007) using nhei/xhoi restriction sites to yield pcscw2-mers-n-ires-gfp.lentiviral vectors were produced and used for the generation of antigen-expressing dendritic cell lines as described, before (malczyk et al., 2015) . in short, hiv-1-derived vectors were generated using a standard 3 plasmid system and the transfer vector plasmid pcscw2-mers-n-ires-gfp by pei transfection. subsequent purification after harvest of transfected 293 t cells yielded virus stocks used to transduce dc cell lines, which were single cell-sorted by facs and selected for antigen expression.mers-n encoding vaccine candidates mv vac2 -mers-n(p) and mv vac2 -mers-n(h) were rescued as described (malczyk et al., 2015; martin et al., 2006) . single syncytia were picked and overlaid onto 50% confluent vero cells cultured in 6-well plates and harvested as "passage 0" (p0) by scraping and freeze-thaw cycle of cells at the time of maximal infection. subsequent passages were generated as described for the following viruses. mers-n encoding vaccine viruses in p3 were used for characterization, viruses in p4 for vaccination. mers-s encoding vaccine virus mv vac2 -mers-s(h), and control virus mv vac2 -atu(p) (malczyk et al., 2015) were also used in p4 for vaccination. both as well as mv vac2 -gfp(p) and mers-cov (isolate emc/2012) (zaki et al., 2012) used for neutralization assays were propagated and titrated on vero cells by the method of spearman and kaerber (hubert, 1984; kärber, 1931) . mv vac2 -mers-s(h) was inactivated by uv-irradiation using a cl-1000 uv crosslinker (uvp, cambridge, uk). 100 μl of virus suspension in 48-well-plates on ice were exposed to uv light of 254 nm at 3 cm distance from the uv source of 1,85 × 10 5 μj/cm 2 for 30 min. inactivation of virus was controlled by incubation of vero cells with a control aliquot inactivated, in parallel. all virus stocks were stored in aliquots at −80°c.cells were lysed and immunoblotted as previously described (funke et al., 2008) . a rabbit anti-mers-cov serum (1:1000) was used as primary antibody for mers-cov-n and a rabbit anti-mv-n polyclonal antibody (1:25,000) (abcam) for mv-n detection. a donkey hrp-coupled anti-rabbit igg (h&l) polyclonal antibody (1:10,000) (rockland, gilbertsville, pa) served as secondary antibody for both. peroxidase activity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (thermo scientific, bremen, germany) on amersham hyperfilm ecl (ge healthcare, freiburg, germany).all animal experiments were carried out in compliance with the regulations of german animal protection laws and as authorized by the rp darmstadt. six-to 12-week-old or 7 months old ifnar -/--cd46ge mice (mrkic et al., 1998) deficient for type i ifn receptor and transgenically expressing human cd46 were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 × 10 5 tcid 50 of recombinant viruses or uv-inactivated vaccine preparations on days 0 and either on day 21 or 28. mice were bled on days 0, 28, and 49 post initial infection (p.i.). serum samples were stored at − 20°c. mice were euthanized on days 32, 42, or 49 p.i., and splenocytes were harvested for assessment of cellular immune responses.quantification of vnts was done as described, before (malczyk et al., 2015) . in brief, mouse sera were serially diluted in 2-fold dilution steps in dmem in duplicates. a total of 50 pfu of mv vac2 -gfp(p) or 200 tcid 50 of mers-cov (strain emc/2012) were mixed with diluted sera and incubated at 37°c for 1 h. virus suspensions were added to 1 × 10 4 vero cells seeded 4 h prior to assay in 96-well plates and incubated for 4 days at 37°c. vnts were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest mean dilution that abolished infection.murine gamma interferon (ifn-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (elispot) assays (ebioscience, frankfurt, germany) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using multiscreen immunoprecipitation (ip) elispot polyvinylidene difluoride (pvdf) 96well plates (merck millipore, darmstadt, germany). 5 × 10 5 isolated medium inoculated mice served as mock control. vnts were calculated as the highest dilution abolishing infectivity. dots represent single animals (n = 6);

(right) to analyze cellular responses directed against mv, splenocytes were stimulated with 10 μg/ml mv bulk antigen (mv bulk) or left unstimulated (sham). the reactivity of splenocytes was confirmed

co-cultured with different stimuli in 200 μl rpmi + 10% fbs, 2 mm l-gln, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin for 36 h. for re-stimulation of mers n-specific t cells, splenocytes were co-cultivated with 5 × 10 4 jawsii, dc2.4 dendritic cells, or clones of either cell line encoding mers-n. on the other hand, splenocytes were stimulated with 10 μg/ml mv bulk antigen (serion immunologics, würzburg, germany), 10 μg/ml mers s-derived peptide s1165 (biosynthesis inc., lewisville, tx, usa, (channappanavar et al., 2014) ), or 10 μg/ml siinfekl control peptide (sin) of ovalbumin (aa 257-264) (invivogen, san diego, ca, usa), as appropriate. for general t cell stimulation, 10 μg/ml concanavalin a (cona, sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa) was used. as negative control, splenocytes were left untreated. after 36 h, cells were removed from the plates, and plates were incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-ifn-γ antibodies and avidin-hrp according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3-amino-9ethyl-carbazole (aec; sigma-aldrich) substrate solution for development of spots was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions using aec dissolved in n,n-dimethylformamide (merck millipore) and used for peroxidase-dependent staining, afterwards. spots were counted using an eli.scan elispot scanner (ae.l.vis, hamburg, germany) and elispot analysis software eli.analyse v5.0 (ae.l.vis).for flow cytometry-based determination of cytokine expression by intracellular cytokine staining (ics), splenocytes of vaccinated mice were isolated, and 2 × 10 6 splenocytes per mouse were cultivated in 200 μl rpmi1640 + 10% fbs, 2 mm l-gln, 1 × non-essential amino acids (biochrom), 10 mm hepes, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50 μm βmercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml brefeldin a (sigma-aldrich), and one of the stimuli also used for elispot analysis. for general t cell stimulation, 0.25 μg/ml tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (tpa, sigma aldrich) and 0.5 μg/ml ionomycin (iono, sigma-aldrich) were used as positive control, and only medium was used as negative control. splenocytes were stimulated for 5 h at 37°c. subsequently, cells were stained with fixable viability dye efluor450 (ebioscience), cd4-pe (1:2000) (bd, franklin lakes, nj, usa), cd8-fitc (1:500) (bd), and, after permeabilization with fixation/permeabilization solution (bd) and perm/ wash buffer (bd), stained with ifn-γ-apc (1:500) (bd) and tnf-α-pe-cy7 (1:500) (bd). cells were fixed with ice-cold 1% paraformaldehyde (pfa) in pbs and analyzed via flow cytometry using an lsrii sorp flow cytometer (bd) and fcs express software (de novo software, glendale, ca, usa).since the nucleocapsid protein (n) of cov is quite conserved, it is regarded as an appropriate target to induce anti-viral t cells. therefore, mers-cov n was chosen as an alternative antigen to be expressed by the recombinant mv vaccine platform. full-length mers-n was cloned into two different additional transcription units (atus) either behind p (post p) or h (post h) cassettes of measles vaccine strain mv vac2 genome, and virus clones were successfully rescued and amplified in vero cells with titers of up to 2 × 10 8 tcid 50 /ml. the essential verification of antigen expression by western blot analysis of vero cells infected with the mv vac2 -mers-n vaccines revealed expression of the n antigen with only little impact of the genomic position of the transgene cassette (fig. 1a) , while growth kinetics showed no impairment of virus replication compared to the respective mv vac2 -gfp(p) control virus ( fig. 1 b, c) .to test the efficacy of the mv vac2 -mers-n candidate in vivo, genetically modified ifnar -/--cd46ge mice were chosen, since they are the prime small animal model for analysis of mv-derived vaccines (mrkic et al., 1998) . thus, 6 mice per group were inoculated via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route on days 0 and 28 with each time 1 × 10 5 tcid 50 of mv vac2 -mers-n(p), mv vac2 -mers-n(h), or empty control virus mv vac2 -atu(p). medium-inoculated mice served as negative controls. 21 days or four days after boost immunization, sera or splenocytes of immunized mice were sampled, respectively (fig. 1d) . as expected, all mice immunized with recombinant mv (including the control virus) developed high mv virus neutralizing titers (vnt) (512-2048 vnt, fig. 1f ). little evidence for induction of neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov was found in all mice, as expected for the intra-particular antigen (fig. 1e) . no vnts against mv or mers-cov were detected in control mice inoculated with medium alone.to analyze splenocytes of animals vaccinated with mv vac2 -mers-n (h) or control animals inoculated with medium or mv vac2 -atu(p) by elispot assay for antigen-specific ifn-γ secretion, the antigen-specific t cells were re-stimulated in vitro by syngeneic murine dc cell lines (jawsii and dc2.4), which had been genetically modified by lentiviral vector transduction to stably express mers-n protein and thereby to present the respective t cell epitopes on mhc. single cell clones were derived by flow cytometric sorting of single gfp-positive cells. antigen expression by transduced dcs was verified by western blot analysis (data not shown). elispot assays using splenocytes of vaccinated animals in co-culture with jawsii-mers-n or dc2.4-mers-n revealed about 200 ifn-γ secreting cells per 1 × 10 6 splenocytes after immunization with mv vac2 -mers-n(h) (fig. 1g) , which was significant over controls. additionally, cellular immune responses targeting mv antigens were detected upon stimulation with mv bulk antigens in vaccinated mice that had received any recombinant virus, as expected. however, mv bulk antigens stimulated about 930-1500 ifn-γ secreting cells per 1 × 10 6 splenocytes of mv vaccinated animals, as described, before (malczyk et al., 2015) . finally, splenocytes of all mice revealed a similar basic reactivity to unspecific t cell stimulation, as confirmed by similar numbers of ifn-γ secreting cells upon cona treatment (fig. 1g) . thus, the generated mv-based vaccine platform expressing mers-n induces significant mers n-specific cellular immune responses, as desired. in any case, humoral and cellular responses induced by vaccine candidate mv vac2 -mers-s had been considerably higher in previous analyses under similar conditions (malczyk et al., 2015) . therefore, further characterization of anti-mers-cov immunity induced by mv vac2 -derived vaccines proceeded with this mers-s encoding vaccine candidate, which yielded approximately 5-fold higher numbers of reactive t cells after vaccination.since the mers vaccine candidate mv vac2 -mers-s(h) induced robust protective humoral and cellular immune responses in ifnar -/--cd46ge mice (malczyk et al., 2015) , we were interested in the necessity of viral replication of this life-attenuated vaccine for the induction of mers cov-specific immunity. for these analyses ifnar -/--cd46ge mice were chosen as the animal model, again, since these mice are the standard animal model for analysis of mv-derived vaccines (mühlebach, 2017) , their genetic composition is compatible with an established mers-cov challenge model , as shown, before (malczyk et al., 2015) , and their size allows housing under regularly available conditions opposed to dromedary camels, the only know natural host of mers-cov, to date.as all morbilliviruses, the mv-based vaccine virions are highly cellassociated, and transfer of antigenic protein within the vaccine preparation cannot be excluded. therefore, we vaccinated these mv-susceptible mice with either 1 × 10 5 tcid 50 of live or of the same formulation and quantity uv-inactivated mv vac2 -mers-s(h) in a primeboost regimen ( fig. 2a) . mv vac2 -atu(p), which does not encode any additional antigen, was included as vector control. blood was drawn from naïve mice on day 0 before vaccination, and on days 28 and 49 post-immunization. serum samples were tested for their ability to neutralize mv vac2 -gfp(p) (fig. 2b , d, f) or mers-cov (fig. 2c, e, g) . sera of naïve mice had no neutralizing antibodies against either virus (fig. 2b, c) . after the first immunization, both live virus preparations induced neutralizing antibodies against mv, with mv vac2 -atu(p) triggering significantly higher titers (1280-1920 vnt) than mv vac2 -mers-s(h) (480-640 vnt). after the second immunization, anti-mv vnts increased to titers of 640-2560 in both cohorts. in contrast, only one out of four animals in the uv-inactivated vaccine group had a borderline neutralizing antibody titer of 20 after the first immunization, and another animal had a titer of 30 after the boost. while mv vac2 -atu(p) and the uv-inactivated mv vac2 -mers-s(h) vaccine did not induce neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov above background levels over the course of the experiment, the group vaccinated with live mv vac2 -mers-s(h) developed titers around 50 after the first immunization and 40-320 (mean of 300) after the boost. taken together, these data reveal that replication of the vaccine is necessary to induce functional antibody responses against mv and the additional antigen mers-s.to assess the capacity of the different mv vac2 -mers-s(h) vaccine preparations to induce mers-cov s-specific cellular immune responses, splenocytes of mice, which had already been tested for humoral responses ( fig. 2a) , were isolated and analyzed 49 days after immunization for antigen(ag)-dependent ifn-γ secretion using elispot assay. the isolated splenocytes were re-stimulated with mers-s immunodominant peptide s1165 (channappanavar et al., 2014) or mv bulk antigen (mv bulk) to analyze mv-specific cellular immune responses. ovalbumin-derived siinfekl-peptide (sin) served as peptide negative control, or cells were left untreated (mock). stimulation with concanavalin a (cona) was used to confirm general t cell reactivity in splenocyte preparations (fig. 2h) . while splenocytes of all mice responded to cona with 1000 to 1500 spots per 1 × 10 6 splenocytes, only those from animals vaccinated with live mv vac2 -mers-s(h) could be stimulated with mers s-specific peptide s1165 reaching mean values of 1040 spots per 1 × 10 6 splenocytes. in contrast, splenocytes of the uv-inactivated group or control virus mv vac2 -atu(p) could not be restimulated to secrete ifn-γ. furthermore, only replication-competent vaccine viruses induced mv-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice. re-stimulation with mv bulk ag induced a mean of 800 and 970 spots per 1 × 10 6 splenocytes for mv vac2 -mers-s(h) or mv vac2 -atu(p) vaccinated mice, respectively. consequently, replication of the vaccine candidate is essential to induce both arms of the immune system with responses against mv as well as the additional mers-s antigen.usually, 6-12 weeks old juvenile mice are used for our mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in sera of (b, c) naїve mice, or in sera of mice after (d, e) prime-or (f, g) boost-immunization. one-way anova with tukey multiple comparison. * : p < 0,05; * *: p < 0,01; ***: p < 0001; ****: p < 0,0001.

immunization studies. to evaluate if there is an age-dependent change in vaccination efficacy, approximately 7 months-old mice were vaccinated with mv vac2 -mers-s(h) in a prime-boost vaccination scheme with 3 weeks between prime and boost vaccination (fig. 3a ). mice were sacrificed at day 42 post-immunization, and splenocytes were re-stimulated with mv-antigens or mers-s peptide s1165. we found that reactive ifn-γ-secreting t cells were also specifically induced in mice of this age (fig. 3b) . a mean of 520 spots per 1 × 10 6 splenocytes was detected upon re-stimulation with mv bulk antigen, whereas 900 spots per 1 × 10 6 splenocytes were induced by re-stimulation with the mers s-derived peptide s1165, illustrating that mv-and mers-cov-specific cellular immune responses are effectively induced in adult mice.to gain more detailed insights in the quality of the observed t cell responses, we further characterized the responsive t cell populations by flow cytometry, determining the expression of cd8 + and cd4 + surface markers as well as ifn-γ and tnf-α upon re-stimulation with s1165 or mv bulk antigen. as a positive stimulus for t cell activation tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate and ionomycin (tpa/iono) were used. exocytosis of cytokines was blocked by addition of brefeldin a (10 μg/ ml) during stimulation. cells were permeabilized, labelled, and fixed for flow cytometry. the gating strategy excluded duplicates (not shown), selected for living cells (fig. 4a, upper panel) , and separated cd8 + and cd4 + t cells (fig. 4a, lower panel) . selected cd8 + t cells were then analyzed for their expression of ifn-γ (fig. 4b left panel) , tnf-α (fig. 4b middle panel) , or both ( fig. 4b right panel) as exemplarily shown for splenocytes re-stimulated with mers-s peptide s1165. likewise, cd4 + t cells expressing ifn-γ (fig. 4c, left panel) , tnf-α (fig. 4c, middle panel) , or both (fig. 4c , right panel) are depicted after re-stimulation with mv bulk antigen.vaccination with mv vac2 -mers-s(h) induced a significant amount of mers s-specific cd8 + t cells expressing either ifn-γ (fig. 4d, left  panel) or tnf-α (fig. 4d, middle panel) , with means of 0.6% and 0.4% of total positive cells, respectively. among those, a significant fraction of cells revealed to be multifunctional, with a mean of 0.3% of all cd8 + cells or 75% of the tnf-α − responsive cells being positive for both cytokines (fig. 4d, right panel) . moreover, vaccination induced a significant fraction of vector-specific cd4 + t cells expressing ifn-γ (fig. 4e, left panel) , or tnf-α (fig. 4e , middle panel) upon re-stimulation with mv bulk antigen. among those, multifunctional cd4 + t cells expressing both cytokines were induced with a mean of about 0.1% (fig. 4e, right panel) . to conclude, vaccination with mv vac2 -mers-s(h) induces not only ifn-γ or tnf-α expressing t cells directed against mers-cov and mv, but also a significant fraction of multifunctional cytotoxic t cells specific for mers-s and cd4 + t cells specific for mv antigens, illustrating that a broad and robust mers-covspecific immune response is induced by vaccination with mv vac2 -mers-s(h).in this study, we aimed to understand the induction of immunity and the functionality of induced t cell responses after vaccination with mv vac2 -mers-s(h), a vaccine candidate that induces protective immunity against mers-cov in an appropriate animal model. in parallel, we generated and tested also alternative mv-based vaccine candidates expressing mers-cov n protein as conserved t cell antigen. mv vac2 -mers-n vaccine candidates indeed induced significant antigen-specific cellular immune responses in vaccinated transgenic mice, revealing that also mers n-expression by recombinant mv may have a useful role to combat mers-cov. since the immune responses induced by mers-s expressing candidates had been nevertheless considerably higher, we proceeded with s-expressing vaccine virus to characterize the induction of anti-mers-cov immunity by mv-based vectors.using mv vac2 -mers-s(h), robust anti-mers cov immune responses were induced also in older mice, while replication of the vaccine vector was necessary to induce either arm of adaptive immunity against vector or pathogen. furthermore, vaccination with mv vac2 -mers-s(h) triggered significant numbers of multifunctional mers s-specific cd8 + t cells and mv-specific cd4 + t cells, simultaneously producing ifn-γ and tnf-α upon stimulation with respective antigens.since not only numbers, but also the quality of the induced mers cov-specific t cell responses might be relevant for protection against mers-cov, it is quite encouraging to see that approx. 50% of ifn-γ reactive cd8 + t cells also expressed tnf-α, whereas in reverse 75% of tnf-α-reactive cd8 + t cells co-expressed ifn-γ upon stimulation with the immune-dominant mers-s peptide. this induction of multifunctional t cells is quite in accordance with previous studies, since the potential of mv during natural infection or the recombinant mv to induce multifunctional, antigen-specific t cells has already been demonstrated. infection of macaques with wild-type mv induces polyfunctional t cells specific for mv proteins with increasing numbers of cells secreting il-2, tnf-α, as well as ifn-γ over time (nelson et al., 2017) , and polyfunctional t cells directed against mv-h can be expanded from pbmc of human donors (ndhlovu et al., 2010) . likewise, hiv-vaccine candidates mv1-f4, which encode gag, rt, and nef of an hiv-1 clade b or a clade c strain as foreign antigen, induce antigenspecific multifunctional t cells simultaneously expressing ifn-γ, tnf-α, and il-2 in mice and also macaques (stebbings et al., 2013 (stebbings et al., , 2012 . while the combination of ifn-γ and tnf-α indicates functional t cells fig. 3 ) were re-stimulated and subjected to intracellular staining (ics) for ifn-γ and

reactivity of splenocytes was confirmed by tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate and ionomycin (tpa/iono) treatment (10 μg/ml). dots represent individual animals, horizontal bars mean. repeated-measures one-way anova with tukey multiple comparison. *: p < 0,05. with higher potency, in general, expression of il-2 is a sign of the induction of cd8 + memory t cells (williams et al., 2006) . in our study, the strong correlation of ifn-γ and tnf-α expression thus indicates a high functionality of induced t cell responses. extension of the antibody panel for il-2 detection could yield further insight into the durability of these t cell responses induced by the mv vaccine platform in future studies.such multifunctional cd8 + t cells specific for mers-cov may become especially important, since mouse studies have shown that cd8 + t cells are crucial for clearance of mers-cov infection (coleman et al., 2017; zhao et al., 2014) . noteworthy, for other viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva), or cytomegalovirus (cmv) the amount of just ifn-γ producing t cells does not correlate with ctl killing effectivity, but the multifunctionality of antigen-specific t cells inversely correlated with viral load (betts et al., 2006; lichterfeld et al., 2004; precopio et al., 2007; sandberg et al., 2001) , further underlining the importance of multifunctionality.besides these cellular immune responses, also considerable humoral immunity was induced in vaccinated animals, here. the mean vnt was somewhat lower than expected (malczyk et al., 2015) , but still quite high. an alternative vaccine candidate derived from modified vaccinia virus ankara, mva-mers-s, revealed protection in dromedary camels, the natural host for mers-cov (haagmans et al., 2016) . passive immunotherapy with dromedary immune sera significantly reduced mers-cov titers in lung tissue of challenged mice, starting with a vnt of 160 (zhao et al., 2015) . neutralizing antibody titers in reconvalescent plasma of human patients diagnosed with mers were determined by microneutralization tests in two previous studies, and were on average at 175 (arabi et al., 2016) or 58.3 (zhao et al., 2017) . furthermore, a prnt 50 titer of at least just 50 was required to lower virus titers by more than 0.5 log in mice challenged after transfer of human reconvalescent plasma (zhao et al., 2017) . these titers were exceeded in this study. in addition, mv vac2 -mers-s(h) induced higher anti-mers-s titers in c57/bl6 mice than mva-mers-s in balb/c mice, when comparing studies that used similar virus titers for vaccination (malczyk et al., 2015; volz et al., 2015) , thus indicating an at least comparable efficacy. thus, also vnt determined here indicate efficacy and were anyway not statistically different from those published before for mv vac2 -mers-s(h) (malczyk et al., 2015) . nevertheless, the exact correlates of protection for mers-cov remain to be determined in future studies, since it will be essential to evaluate the efficacy of the different vaccine candidates against this most important benchmark.in contrast, uv-inactivated mv vac2 -mers-s(h) did not induce any antibodies able to neutralize mers-cov or mv. while neutralizing antibodies can in principle also be induced by inactivated vaccines or proteins, e.g. full-length or truncated mers-s protein in combination with adjuvant (wang et al., 2015) . obviously, the amount of mers-s antigen within the mv vac2 -mers-s(h) vaccine formulation or the adjuvant effect of the inactivate were not sufficient during application. therefore, replication of the mv-derived mers vaccine candidate is necessary for the induction of immune responses both against vector and antigen of interest in vaccinated animals. indeed, the induction of cellular immunity is usually more efficient by de novo expression of antigen after immunization. consequently, the application of a replication competent vaccine platform is justified here to robustly induce potent responses of both arms of the adaptive immune system.these powerful immune responses were not only induced in juvenile mice 6-12 weeks of age, but also in adult mice older than half a year of age. this is quite of interest, since adult vaccinees are also the target group for vaccination in response to the mers-cov outbreak, as defined in the target product profile by the who (http://www.who.int/ blueprint/what/research-development/mers_cov_tpp_ 15052017.pdf). remarkably, mv vaccine strain virus encoding chikungunya virus (chikv) antigens was already tested in a phase i clinical trial in adult human vaccinees (18-45 years old) (ramsauer et al., 2015) . these adult test subjects all developed significant humoral immunity against chikv, despite their adult age and most interestingly also independent from measles pre-immunity.taken together, these study shows that mv vac2 -mers-s(h) induces surprisingly high numbers of multifunctional t cells specific for mers-s also in adult test subjects, as a result from replication of the recombinant vector. therefore, high quality cellular immune responses are induced in addition to the robust antibody responses by this vaccine candidate, further qualifying mv vac2 -mers-s(h) for evaluation as vaccine candidate against mers-cov. in parallel, mers-n encoding mv can be a further option to generate protection against mers in future studies and constructs.middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) is a newly emerged infectious disease caused by a novel ␤-coronavirus (␤-cov), mers coronavirus (mers-cov). mers-cov was first identified in humans in saudi arabia on june 12, 2012 (zaki et al., 2012) . although the spread of mers-cov among humans has been limited, mers-cov infection has been linked to several family clusters and healthcare workers memish et al., 2013b memish et al., , 2013c , providing evidence for human-to-human transmissibility of the virus. mers-cov has demonstrated an increasing trend of infection since its first identification. sporadic mers cases have been reported in at least 21 countries in the middle east, africa, europe, asia and north america. as of november 7, 2014, a total of 909 laboratory-confirmed cases including 331 deaths (mortality rate ∼36%) were reported (http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-november-2014-mers/en/). the geographic spread and rapid increase of mers cases during the past several months have raised concerns of pandemic potential, even though the consequences of such pandemic might be less severe than those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), another ␤-cov which led to a worldwide outbreak in 2003 (peiris et al., 2003) . as a practical control strategy against the potential outbreak of mers-cov-caused emerging infectious disease, development of effective vaccines has become a high priority.a number of studies have pointed out the transmission hosts for mers-cov. it is reported that bat-derived coronaviruses, particularly bat coronavirus hku4, have close phylogenetic relationship with mers-cov and that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), the receptor for mers-cov, is also the receptor for hku4. while hku4 prefers bat dpp4 over human dpp4, mers-cov has adapted to use human dpp4, in addition to bind bat dpp4, suggesting that (1) bats are potential natural reservoirs for mers-cov; and (2) bat coronaviruses remain a threat to human health because of their potential for cross-species transmission (annan et al., 2013; cui et al., 2013; ithete et al., 2013; memish et al., 2013a; yang et al., 2014) . in addition to bats, camels have recently become a focus for the study of mers-cov transmission since mers-cov neutralizing antibodies and mers-cov gene fragments have been identified in dromedary camels, and infectious mers-cov has been recovered from infected camels (briese et al., 2014; chu et al., 2014; drosten et al., 2014; haagmans et al., 2014; meyer et al., 2014; nowotny and kolodziejek, 2014; reusken et al., 2013) . the fact that humans were infected with mers-cov after exposure to infected camels suggests that camels are the most likely intermediate transmission hosts of mers-cov . most recently, mers-cov rna fragments were detected in an air sample collected from the barn that sheltered mers-cov-infected camels (azhar et al., 2014) , indicating possible airborne transmission of mers-cov between animals and humans. although the spread of mers-cov among humans is limited and inefficient , the increased infection rate among healthcare workers during the month of april 2014 (http://www. who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus infections/archive updates/en/) has raised concerns of future epidemic potential, which call for the development of effective and safe vaccines to prevent and control mers (hotez et al., 2014) .mers-cov belongs to lineage c of ␤-cov with a close relationship to the bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 and is the first known lineage c ␤-cov associated with human infections (chan et al., 2013b; woo et al., 2012) . mers-cov is a positive-sense, singlestranded rna virus whose genome encodes four major structural proteins, including spike protein (s), envelope protein (e), membrane protein (m) and nucleocapsid protein (n), each with unique functions (fig. 1a) . the e protein is a transmembrane protein which forms an ion channel on the viral surface, while the n protein interactively functions with the m protein and other n molecules encapsulating genomic rna (hurst et al., 2010) .among the four structural proteins of mers-cov, the s protein plays the most important roles in virus infection and pathogenesis. it displays as a trimer on the viral membrane surface. the precursor s protein is cleaved into two noncovalently associated subunits: the distal subunit s1 and the membrane-anchored subunit s2. the mers-cov s1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (rbd), including a core structure and an accessory subdomain receptor-binding motif (rbm), while the s2 subunit consists of a putative fusion peptide, transmembrane domain and two heptad repeat regions, termed heptad repeats 1 and 2 (hr1 and hr2) ( fig. 1b) (chen et al., 2013b; lu et al., 2013a; wang et al., 2013) .although mers-cov and sars-cov share similar core structures to maintain conformational integrity, their rbms are different (chen et al., 2013b; li et al., 2005) . as such, the receptors recognized by both coronaviruses are distinctively different.angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is a functional receptor for sars-cov, while dpp4 (also known as cd26) is an identified receptor for mers-cov (li et al., 2003; raj et al., 2013) . the crystal structures of sars-cov rbd complexed with its receptor ace2 have identified the rbd of sars-cov as residues 306-527 and the rbm as residues 424-494 (li et al., 2005) . crystal structure analysis of mers-cov rbd alone or rbd/dpp4 complex has mapped the rbd to residues 367-588 and 367-606, respectively, in the s protein of mers-cov, with the rbm spanning residues 484-567 (chen et al., 2013b; lu et al., 2013a; wang et al., 2013) . fig. 2 lists the crystal structures of sars-cov and mers-cov rbds and their complexes with respective receptors.mers-cov undergoes two major processes to infect target cells. first, the virus binds to the cellular receptor dpp4 via the rbd in the s1 subunit. second, the hr1/hr2 complex in the s2 subunit forms a fusion core, leading to cell-virus membrane fusion, thereby mediating mers-cov entry into the target cells lu et al., 2014) . therefore, like sars-cov s protein, the s protein of mers-cov plays an essential role in receptor binding, membrane fusion and cell entry. we have previously demonstrated that the s protein, or, more specifically, the rbd, of sars-cov played an essential role in developing sars vaccines (du et al., 2009a; jiang et al., 2012b) . it is thus expected that the rbd of mers-cov s protein will be an important target for developing vaccines against mers (lu et al., 2013b; ma et al., 2014b) .antibodies induced by sars-cov rbd do not cross-neutralize mers-cov infection since different receptors are recognized by the two coronaviruses, suggesting that developing a safe and effective mers vaccine is a high priority (du et al., , 2013c . since mers is a newly-emerged viral disease, no vaccines have been developed for clinical use. however, a number of vaccine candidates have been tested and/or proven effective in in vitro preclinical studies. current updates on mers vaccine development, including the possibility for developing certain vaccine types as candidates against mers, are discussed below.it was revealed that a recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing the full-length mers-cov s protein, mva-mers-s, produced neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice against infections from mers-cov in cell cultures in vitro (song et al., 2013) , providing a basis for developing viral vectorbased mers vaccines. in addition, full-length infectious cdna clones of mers-cov have been constructed using reverse genetics systems, and relevant infectious viruses could be rescued and propagated in vero a66 and huh-7 (human liver) cells (almazán et al., 2013; scobey et al., 2013) . reports have also shown that a fullgenome sequence of mers-cov (jordan-n3/2012 strain) exhibited stability after sequential passages in two mammalian cell lines: vero (african green monkey kidney) and mrc5 (human lung) (frey et al., 2014) . the above studies indicate the potential for developing live-attenuated viruses as mers vaccine candidates. moreover, it was reported that high titers of specific antibodies with neutralizing activity can be generated in mice through vaccination with nanoparticles expressing the full-length mers-cov s protein, suggesting the possibility of developing nanoparticle-based mers vaccines (coleman et al., 2014a) .in addition to the aforementioned vaccine types, epitope-based and subunit vaccines also show promise against mers-cov infection or are under investigation for their efficacy. for example, recent studies in sequence analysis and computational prediction have identified an immunogenic and conserved epitope, wdypkcdra, in the rna-directed rna polymerase protein of human coronaviruses, supporting the concept of designing and developing epitope-based universal vaccines against mers (sharmin and islam, 2014) . additionally, recombinant proteins containing rbd of mers-cov s protein are able to elicit strong neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated rabbits and mice, respectively (du et al., , 2013c ma et al., 2014a ma et al., , 2014b mou et al., 2013) , reinforcing the significance of developing protein-based subunit mers vaccines. these candidate vaccines represent the first step in the control and prevention of mers-cov infection.subunit vaccines are defined as those based on purified proteins or peptides consisting of major antigenic fragments of pathogens (hansson et al ., 2000) . subunit vaccines possess a variety of advantages, including high safety profile, minimal side effects at the injection sites and constant immune effects for the well-defined pathogenic fragments (du et al., 2008; zhang et al., 2014) . although reports on mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines are limited, subunit vaccines based on sars-cov rbd have been extensively studied and tested since the occurrence of sars in 2002, showing sufficient efficacy and strong protection against sars-cov infections in various animal models (du et al., 2007 (du et al., , 2009b he et al., 2004; zakhartchouk et al., 2007) . therefore, a summary of sars-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines will provide useful information and specific guidance on the design of effective rbd-based subunit vaccines against mers-cov.considerable evidence has shown that the sars-cov rbd contains multiple conformation-dependent epitopes that induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies and is, therefore, a critical neutralization determinant for developing sars subunit vaccines (he et al., 2005a (he et al., , 2005b .it is believed that a recombinant fusion protein (rbd-fc) containing the rbd (residues 318-510) of sars-cov s protein fused with human igg1 fc fragment induced strong antibody responses with neutralizing activity and elicited long-term protective immunity in immunized rabbits and mice, respectively, completely protecting immunized mice from sars-cov challenge (du et al., 2007; he et al., 2004) . we have also identified that recombinant rbd proteins (residues 318-510) expressed in mammalian cells 293t and cho, insect cell sf9 and escherichia coli, respectively, were able to elicit sufficient neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against sars-cov challenge in immunized mice, among which the mammalian 293t cell-expressed rbd induced higher neutralizing antibody responses than those expressed in insect cell and e. coli systems (du et al., 2009b (du et al., , 2009c . moreover, the 293t-expressing rbd was capable of inducing high titers of protective anti-rbd antibody response in immunized nonhuman primates, strongly neutralizing s protein-mediated sars pseudovirus infection in ace2-expressing target cells (wang et al., 2012) . furthermore, we have shown that a cho-expressing sars-cov rbd protein containing residues 318-536 elicited potent neutralizing antibody response in immunized mice with complete protective immunity , and that a yeast-expressed rbd219n-1 protein induced strong rbd-specific neutralizing antibody responses against pseudovirus and live sars-cov infections .interestingly, the recombinant rbds from the s proteins of tor2, gd03 and sz3, the representative strains of human 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 sars-cov and palm civet sars-cov, respectively, elicited strong cross-neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits against pseudoviruses expressing s proteins of these virus strains. the cross-neutralization of human and palm civet by sars-cov rbd-specific antibodies suggests that the rbd-based sars-cov subunit vaccines are able to induce broad cross-protective immunity against human and animal sars-cov variants (he et al., 2006) . it is noted that high titers of rbd-specific neutralizing antibodies persistently existed in recovered patients in a three-year follow-up study, indicating that the rbd of sars-cov is highly immunogenic in humans (cao et al., 2010) , thus providing the basis for the development of effective subunit vaccines to prevent sars-cov infections in humans. currently, this rbd-based subunit vaccine is in preclinical testing in small animal and primate animal challenge models, in anticipation of manufacture for clinical evaluation in the next five years (jiang et al., 2012a) .the above summary suggests a paradigm that supports the development of a mers-cov subunit vaccine, indicating that the rbd of mers-cov is an important target for the development of mers-cov subunit vaccines and will, like its sars-cov counterpart, induce strong neutralizing antibody responses against mers-cov infection (du et al., 2009a; zhu et al., 2013) .based on our previous experience in developing sars-cov rbdbased subunit vaccines, we rapidly identified the rbd of mers-cov as an essential vaccine target for mers. we have optimized the mers-cov rbd region and identified a critical neutralizing domain, among the five rbd fragments tested that induces the highest neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov infection (ma et al., 2014b) . our progress in the development of mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines is summarized below.to identify the rbd of mers-cov, we initially aligned the sequences of mers-cov s protein with those of sars-cov s protein and found that residues 377-662 in the mers-cov s protein shared similar core structures with sars-cov rbd, increasing the likelihood that the rbd of mers-cov might be located in this region . a recombinant protein (s377-662-fc) containing residues 377-662 of mers-cov s protein fused with fc fragment of human igg was expressed in the culture supernatant of mammalian cell 293t for the purpose of forming conformational structures and, thus, increasing immunogenicity (du et al., 2013c) .as expected, the expressed recombinant protein was able to form a high molecular-weight molecule, as shown in nonboiled samples in sds-page (fig. 3a, left) , which was recognized by mers-cov s1-specific antibodies (fig. 3a, right) . detection of the binding of s377-662-fc with the receptor of mers-cov, dpp4, by co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that this protein bound significantly to soluble dpp4 (sdpp4) and cell-associated dpp4 in dpp4-expressing huh-7 cells, being recognized by anti-dpp4 and anti-mers-cov-s1 antibodies, respectively (fig. 3b) . elisa and flow cytometry analyses indicated that s377-662-fc bound to sdpp4 and huh-7 in a dose-dependent manner (du et al., 2013c) . these data suggest that the expressed recombinant protein formed conformational structures and that the predicted 286-amino acid fragment contained mers-cov rbd.further evaluation of the immunogenicity of the identified mers-cov rbd demonstrated that the expressed recombinant s377-662-fc protein induced mers-cov rbd-specific antibodies in mice subcutaneously (s.c.) immunized after two vaccinations, resulting in the effective neutralization of mers-cov infection in vero e6 cells in vitro (du et al., 2013c) , indicating that this region may serve as an essential target for developing mers subunit vaccines.as mers-cov is a mucosal pathogen, any vaccination that induces the production of strong mucosal immune responses represented by mucosal iga would have increased potential for the prevention of mers-cov at the site of virus infection. to test the ability of the identified mers-cov rbd as a potential mucosal vaccine, we immunized mice using mers-cov s377-662-fc protein via the intranasal (i.n.) pathway and then compared the systemic and mucosal immune responses and neutralizing antibodies induced by the i.n. route with those elicited by the s.c. route.evaluation of the humoral immune response demonstrated that intranasal boost vaccination of s377-662-fc induced levels of mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies, as well as igg1 (th2) and igg2a (th1) subtypes, as high as those induced via the s.c. route, although igg antibody elicited through the i.n. pathway proved to be relatively lower than that elicited through the s.c. route after a single vaccination (ma et al., 2014a) . similar to immunization by the s.c. route, intranasal vaccination of s377-662-fc was also capable of eliciting effective long-term igg antibody responses, particularly after multiple vaccinations (fig. 3c) (ma et al., 2014a) , confirming the ability of s377-662-fc to induce strong humoral immune responses via the mucosal route.comparison of the mucosal immune response illustrated that intranasal vaccination of s377-622-fc induced a significantly higher level of mers-cov s1-specific iga antibodies than that induced through the s.c. route in immunized mouse lungs (fig. 3d) , although the iga level was only slightly higher in immunized mouse sera via the i.n. route compared to the s.c. route (ma et al., 2014a) . these data suggest that immunization of mers-cov s377-662-fc protein induced strong local mucosal immune responses by the i.n. route, rather than the s.c. route.serum neutralizing antibody titers from intranasal vaccination of s377-662-fc protein maintained levels similar to those of the , either boiled (denatured) or nonboiled (nondenatured), were subjected to sds-page, followed by coomassie blue staining or western blot, using anti-mers-cov-s1 antibodies (1: 1000) developed in our laboratories. the protein molecular weight marker (kda) is indicated on the left. (b) co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis of s377-662-fc binding sdpp4, the receptor for mers-cov (left), and cell-associated dpp4 in huh-7 cells (right). the binding affinity was tested using anti-human dpp4 monoclonal antibody (1 g/ml, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) and anti-mers-cov-s1 polyclonal antibodies (1: 1000). (c) comparison of long-term humoral immune responses induced by s377-662-fc protein in s.c.-and i.n.-immunized mice. the mouse sera were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 months and 10 days post-last boost, and the data are presented as mean (igg endpoint titers) ± standard deviation (sd) of five mice per group. (d) comparison of mucosal immune responses induced by s377-662-fc protein in s.c.-and i.n.-immunized mice. the mouse lung washes were collected at 10 days post-last boost, and the data are presented as mean (iga a450) ± sd of five mice per group. * indicates significant differences between s377-662-fc i.n. group and the other groups (p < 0.05). comparison of neutralizing antibody response against mers-cov infection in vero e6 cells in sera (e) and lung washes (f) of mice s.c.-and i.n.-vaccinated with s377-662-fc protein. neutralizing antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilutions of samples that completely inhibit virus-induced cytopathic effect (cpe) in at least 50% of the wells (nt50). samples were collected at 10 days post-last boost, and the data are presented as mean (neutralizing antibody titers) ± sd of five mice per group. * indicates significant differences between the s377-662-fc i.n. group and the other groups (p < 0.05). for c-f, mice injected with pbs plus respective adjuvants (montanide isa51 for s.c. and poly (i:c) for i.n.) were included as the control. the data are presented as mean (igg a450) ± sd of duplicate wells. (c) comparison of receptor binding affinity of rbd fragments with sdpp4 by elisa. the binding shows dose dependency. the data are presented as mean (igg a450) ± sd of duplicate wells. (d) comparison of immunogenicity of rbd fragments in immunized mice. mouse sera were collected at 10 days post-3rd vaccination, and the data are presented as mean (igg endpoint titers) ± sd of five mice per group. * indicates significant differences between s377-588-fc and s367-588-fc with other groups (p < 0.05). (e) comparison of neutralizing antibody response against mers-cov infection in vero e6 cells in rbd fragment-immunized mice. neutralizing antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilutions of sera that completely inhibit virus-induced cpe in at least 50% of the wells (nt50). mouse sera were collected at 10 days post-3rd vaccination, and the data are presented as mean (neutralizing antibody titers) ± sd of five mice per group. * indicates significant differences between s377-588-fc and other groups (p < 0.05).s.c. route after boost vaccination (fig. 3e) . however, it is worth noting that these neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher in immunized mouse lungs in neutralizing mers-cov infections in target vero e6 cells via the i.n. route, rather than the s.c. route (fig. 3f) , potentially because of the higher titers of mucosal iga antibodies induced in the i.n.-immunized mouse lungs (ma et al., 2014a) .it should be noted that s377-662-fc protein was also able to elicit mers-cov s1-specific cellular immune responses in immunized mouse spleens (ma et al., 2014a) , indicating that cellular immune response might also play a role in the prevention of mers-cov infection. importantly, since rbd-induced systemic humoral and mucosal immune responses, neutralizing antibodies in particular, correspond to the protection against sars-cov infection (du et al., 2007) , it is expected that neutralizing antibodies induced by mers-cov rbd protein will correlate well with inhibition of mers-cov infection. nevertheless, based on the ability of mers-cov rbd protein to induce strong systemic and mucosal immune responses with neutralizing activity, it is expected that mers-cov rbd-based vaccine is an effective and safe mucosal candidate for prevention of mers-cov infection.in addition to the above identified 286-amino acid fragment containing residues 377-662, three additional fragments, respectively, spanning residues 358-588, 367-588 and 367-606 of mers-cov s protein, were defined as mers-cov rbd by other groups (chen et al., 2013b; lu et al., 2013a; mou et al., 2013; wang et al., 2013) . we have also shown that a truncated 212-amino acid fragment spanning s protein residues 377-588 of mers-cov served as a rbd of mers-cov . to identify a critical neutralizing domain in the mers-cov rbd as an ideal mers vaccine candidate, we compared these identified rbd fragments in terms of their antigenicity, dpp4 receptor binding, immunogenicity and neutralizing activity. in order for the recombinant proteins to form suitable conformational structures and maintain sufficient bioactivity, we fused each of these mers-cov rbd fragments to the fc of human igg and expressed the proteins in a mammalian cell expression system (fig. 4a) . previously, this same strategy was implemented and proved to be successful in expressing rbd proteins of sars-cov and influenza virus (du et al., 2011 (du et al., , 2013d li et al., 2013) .as expected, all four mers-cov rbd proteins, designated s377-588-fc, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc and s367-606-fc, respectively, formed dimeric conformational structures and maintained good antigenicity (ma et al., 2014b) , reacting strongly with mers-cov rbd-specific monoclonal antibody mersmab1 developed in our laboratories (fig. 4b ) . although all proteins bound efficiently to sdpp4-and dpp4-expressing huh-7 cells, their binding affinities were notably different, with s377-588-fc as one of the proteins having the highest dpp4-binding activity (fig. 4c) . notably, s377-588-fc also maintained stronger immunogenicity than the other proteins tested, inducing significantly higher igg antibody responses in immunized mice (fig. 4d) , as well as igg1 (th2) and igg2a (th1) subtypes. importantly, s377-588-fc protein was shown to elicit the highest neutralizing antibody titers against infections from mers-cov (fig. 4e) (ma et al., 2014b) .our study identified a truncated fragment spanning residues 377-588 of mers-cov rbd as a critical neutralizing domain, thus making it an ideal target for the development of subunit vaccines against infections from mers-cov (ma et al., 2014b) . the identification of this critical neutralizing rbd fragment provides a foundation for the rapid development of effective and safe subunit vaccines to prevent the spread of mers-cov in humans or the transmission from infected camels to humans.vaccine candidates that have proved effective against mers-cov infections in in vitro culture conditions need to be evaluated in effective animal challenge models to confirm protective immunity. mers-cov has been shown to cause transient lower respiratory tract infection in rhesus macaques, and infected monkeys demonstrated clinical signs of diseases, virus replication, histological lesions and neutralizing antibody generation (de wit et al., 2013b; yao et al., 2014) , demonstrating that monkeys can be used for testing the efficacy of mers candidate vaccines. however, this mers-cov animal model is not affordable for most researchers based on the high cost for purchasing and maintaining monkeys, making it particularly urgent to develop small animal models of mers-cov infection . studies have shown that mers-cov is susceptible to human and nonhuman primate cell types, including huh-7, a549, calu-3, caco-2 (human) and vero (african green monkey), but it is not susceptible to bhk (hamster), mefc57b16 and 3t3 (mouse), or ferret primary kidney cells (chan et al., 2013a; tao et al., 2013; van doremalen et al., 2014) . these findings correspond to the observation that mers-cov infects human and nonhuman primates, but it does not replicate in small animals, such as syrian hamsters, mice and ferrets (coleman et al., 2014b; de wit et al., 2013a; devitt, 2013; raj et al., 2014; van doremalen et al., 2014) .although small animal models for mers-cov are still lacking (devitt, 2013) , researchers have made great progress towards the identification and development of an effective small animal model for mers-cov infections. in particular, it has been shown that mice are susceptible to mers-cov infection after prior transduction with an adenoviral vector expressing the receptor of mers-cov, human dpp4, with infected mice developing pneumonia accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration and histopathological changes . thus, such small animal models can provide a practical platform and an affordable means for evaluating the efficacy of current mers-cov vaccines. accordingly, transgenic dpp4 mouse models that integrate human dpp4 genes into the mouse genome are being established in several laboratories (http://www.nature.com/news/biologists-make-first-mousemodel-for-mers-1.14634) and are expected to be tested for vaccine efficacy in the near future.development of effective vaccines is urgently needed to control the spread of emerging mers-cov infections. while viral vectorbased and live-attenuated virus-based vaccines have potential for providing effective immunity, subunit vaccines will offer the safest means for prevention. although subunit-based vaccines might induce less immunogenicity than the other vaccine types, their efficacy can be significantly improved by rational design based on the structural analysis of rbd of mers-cov s protein and by identification of the most stable and critical neutralizing fragment of rbd, while eliminating non-neutralizing epitopes through immunofocusing (ma et al., 2014b) . overall, our strategies in the development of mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines will provide useful information for the design of effective vaccines against mers-cov and any other emerging coronaviruses that might cause future pandemics. it is expected that such developed mers candidate vaccines will be tested for efficacy in preventing mers-cov infections in vivo once affordable small animal models for mers-cov have become available. because serologic and neutralization responses against s proteins of mers-cov, sars-cov and other coronaviruses share no, to low, levels of cross-reactivity within and/or across subgroups, it is advisable that mers-cov and other coronavirus vaccines be designed by considering construction of chimeric s protein containing neutralizing epitopes from variant virus strains .the authors declared no conflict of interest.middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) is a newly emerged infectious disease caused by a novel β-coronavirus (β-cov), mers coronavirus (mers-cov). mers-cov was first identified in humans in saudi arabia on june 12, 2012 (zaki et al., 2012) . although the spread of mers-cov among humans has been limited, mers-cov infection has been linked to several family clusters and healthcare workers memish et al., 2013b; memish et al., 2013c) , providing evidence for human-to-human transmissibility of the virus. mers-cov has demonstrated an increasing trend of infection since its first identification. sporadic mers cases have been reported in at least 21 countries in the middle east, africa, europe, asia and north america. as of november 7, 2014, a total of 909 laboratory-confirmed cases including 331 deaths (mortality rate ~36%) were reported (http://www.who.int/csr/don/07-november-2014-mers/en/). the geographic spread and rapid increase of mers cases during the past several months have raised concerns of pandemic potential, even though the consequences of such pandemic might be less severe than those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), another β-cov which led to a worldwide outbreak in 2003 (peiris et al., 2003) . as a practical control strategy against the potential outbreak of mers-cov-caused emerging infectious disease, development of effective vaccines has become a high priority.a number of studies have pointed out the transmission hosts for mers-cov. it is reported that bat-derived coronaviruses, particularly bat coronavirus hku4, have close phylogenetic relationship with mers-cov and that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), the receptor for mers-cov, is also the receptor for hku4. while hku4 prefers bat dpp4 over human dpp4, mers-cov has adapted to use human dpp4, in addition to bind bat dpp4, suggesting that (1) bats are potential natural reservoirs for mers-cov; and (2) bat coronaviruses remain a threat to human health because of their potential for cross-species transmission (annan et al., 2013; cui et al., 2013; ithete et al., 2013; memish et al., 2013a; yang et al., 2014) . in addition to bats, camels have recently become a focus for the study of mers-cov transmission since mers-cov neutralizing antibodies and mers-cov gene fragments have been identified in dromedary camels, and infectious mers-cov has been recovered from infected camels (briese et al., 2014; chu et al., 2014; drosten et al., 2014; haagmans et al., 2014; meyer et al., 2014; nowotny and kolodziejek, 2014; . the fact that humans were infected with mers-cov after exposure to infected camels suggests that camels are the most likely intermediate transmission hosts of mers-cov . most recently, mers-cov rna fragments were detected in an air sample collected from the barn that sheltered mers-cov-infected camels (azhar et al., 2014) , indicating possible airborne transmission of mers-cov between animals and humans. although the spread of mers-cov among humans is limited and inefficient , the increased infection rate among healthcare workers during the month of april 2014 (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/ archive_updates/en/) has raised concerns of future epidemic potential, which call for the development of effective and safe vaccines to prevent and control mers (hotez et al., 2014) .mers-cov belongs to lineage c of β-cov with a close relationship to the bat coronaviruses hku4 and hku5 and is the first known lineage c β-cov associated with human infections (chan et al., 2013b; woo et al., 2012) . mers-cov is a positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus whose genome encodes four major structural proteins, including spike protein (s), envelope protein (e), membrane protein (m) and nucleocapsid (n) protein, each with unique functions (fig. 1a) . the e protein is a transmembrane protein which forms an ion channel on the viral surface, while the n protein interactively functions with the m protein and other n molecules encapsulating genomic rna (hurst et al., 2010) .among the four structural proteins of mers-cov, the s protein plays the most important roles in virus infection and pathogenesis. it displays as a trimer on the viral membrane surface. the precursor s protein is cleaved into two noncovalently associated subunits: the distal subunit s1 and the membrane-anchored subunit s2. the mers-cov s1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (rbd), including a core structure and an accessory subdomain receptor-binding motif (rbm), while the s2 subunit consists of a putative fusion peptide, transmembrane domain and two heptad repeat regions, termed heptad repeats 1 and 2 (hr1 and hr2) (fig. 1b) (chen et al., 2013b; lu et al., 2013a; wang et al., 2013) .although mers-cov and sars-cov share similar core structures to maintain conformational integrity, their rbms are different (chen et al., 2013b; li et al., 2005) . as such, the receptors recognized by both coronaviruses are distinctively different. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is a functional receptor for sars-cov, while dpp4 (also known as cd26) is an identified receptor for mers-cov (li et al., 2003; . the crystal structures of sars-cov rbd complexed with its receptor ace2 have identified the rbd of sars-cov as residues 306-527 and the rbm as residues 424-494 (li et al., 2005) . crystal structure analysis of mers-cov rbd alone or rbd/dpp4 complex has mapped the rbd to residues 367-588 and 367-606, respectively, in the s protein of mers-cov, with the rbm spanning residues 484-567 (chen et al., 2013b; lu et al., 2013a; wang et al., 2013) . figure 2 lists the crystal structures of sars-cov and mers-cov rbds and their complexes with respective receptors.mers-cov undergoes two major processes to infect target cells. first, the virus binds to the cellular receptor dpp4 via the rbd in the s1 subunit. second, the hr1/hr2 complex in the s2 subunit forms a fusion core, leading to cell-virus membrane fusion, thereby mediating mers-cov entry into the target cells lu et al., 2014) . therefore, like sars-cov s protein, the s protein of mers-cov plays an essential role in receptor binding, membrane fusion and cell entry. we have previously demonstrated that the s protein, or, more specifically, the rbd, of sars-cov played an essential role in developing sars vaccines (du et al., 2009a; jiang et al., 2012b) . it is thus expected that the rbd of mers-cov s protein will be an important target for developing vaccines against mers (lu et al., 2013b; ma et al., 2014b) .antibodies induced by sars-cov rbd do not cross-neutralize mers-cov infection since different receptors are recognized by the two coronaviruses, suggesting that developing a safe and effective mers vaccine is a high priority du et al., 2013c) . since mers is a newly-emerged viral disease, no vaccines have been developed for clinical use. however, a number of vaccine candidates have been tested and/or proven effective in in vitro preclinical studies. current updates on mers vaccine development, including the possibility for developing certain vaccine types as candidates against mers, are discussed below.it was revealed that a recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing the full-length mers-cov s protein, mva-mers-s, produced neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice against infections from mers-cov in cell cultures in vitro (song et al., 2013) , providing a basis for developing viral vector-based mers vaccines. in addition, fulllength infectious cdna clones of mers-cov have been constructed using reverse genetics systems, and relevant infectious viruses could be rescued and propagated in vero a66 and huh-7 (human liver) cells (almazán et al., 2013; scobey et al., 2013) . reports have also shown that a full-genome sequence of mers-cov (jordan-n3/2012 strain) exhibited stability after sequential passages in two mammalian cell lines, vero (african green monkey kidney) and mrc5 (human lung) (frey et al., 2014) . the above studies indicate the potential for developing live-attenuated viruses as mers vaccine candidates. moreover, it was reported that high titers of specific antibodies with neutralizing activity can be generated in mice through vaccination with nanoparticles expressing the full-length mers-cov s protein, suggesting the possibility of developing nanoparticle-based mers vaccines (coleman et al., 2014a) .in addition to the aforementioned vaccine types, epitope-based and subunit vaccines also show promise against mers-cov infection or are under investigation for their efficacy. for example, recent studies in sequence analysis and computational prediction have identified an immunogenic and conserved epitope, wdypkcdra, in the rna-directed rna polymerase protein of human coronaviruses, supporting the concept of designing and developing epitope-based universal vaccines against mers (sharmin and islam, 2014) . additionally, recombinant proteins containing rbd of mers-cov s protein are able to elicit strong neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated rabbits and mice, respectively du et al., 2013c; ma et al., 2014a; ma et al., 2014b; mou et al., 2013) , reinforcing the significance of developing protein-based subunit mers vaccines. these candidate vaccines represent the first step in the control and prevention of mers-cov infection.subunit vaccines are defined as those based on purified proteins or peptides consisting of major antigenic fragments of pathogens (hansson et al., 2000) . subunit vaccines possess a variety of advantages, including high safety profile, minimal side effects at the injection sites, and constant immune effects for the well-defined pathogenic fragments (du et al., 2008; zhang et al., 2014) . although reports on mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines are limited, subunit vaccines based on sars-cov rbd have been extensively studied and tested since the occurrence of sars in 2002, showing sufficient efficacy and strong protection against sars-cov infections in various animal models (du et al., 2007; du et al., 2009b; he et al., 2004; zakhartchouk et al., 2007) . therefore, a summary of sars-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines will provide useful information and specific guidance on the design of effective rbd-based subunit vaccines against mers-cov.considerable evidence has shown that the sars-cov rbd contains multiple conformationdependent epitopes that induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies and is, therefore, a critical neutralization determinant for developing sars subunit vaccines (he et al., 2005a; he et al., 2005b) .it is believed that a recombinant fusion protein (rbd-fc) containing the rbd (residues 318-510) of sars-cov s protein fused with human igg1 fc fragment induced strong antibody responses with neutralizing activity and elicited long-term protective immunity in immunized rabbits and mice, respectively, completely protecting immunized mice from sars-cov challenge (du et al., 2007; he et al., 2004) . we have also identified that recombinant rbd proteins (residues 318-510) expressed in mammalian cells 293t and cho, insect cell sf9 and e. coli, respectively, were able to elicit sufficient neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against sars-cov challenge in immunized mice, among which the mammalian 293t cell-expressed rbd induced higher neutralizing antibody responses than those expressed in insect cell and e. coli systems (du et al., 2009b; du et al., 2009c) . moreover, the 293t-expressing rbd was capable of inducing high titers of protective anti-rbd antibody response in immunized nonhuman primates, strongly neutralizing s protein-mediated sars pseudovirus infection in ace2-expressing target cells (wang et al., 2012) . furthermore, we have shown that a cho-expressing sars-cov rbd protein containing residues 318-536 elicited potent neutralizing antibody response in immunized mice with complete protective immunity , and that a yeastexpressed rbd219n-1 protein induced strong rbd-specific neutralizing antibody responses against pseudovirus and live sars-cov infections .interestingly, the recombinant rbds from the s proteins of tor2, gd03 and sz3, the representative strains of human 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 sars-cov and palm civet sars-cov, respectively, elicited strong cross-neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits against pseudoviruses expressing s proteins of these virus strains. the crossneutralization of human and palm civet by sars-cov rbd-specific antibodies suggests that the rbd-based sars-cov subunit vaccines are able to induce broad cross-protective immunity against human and animal sars-cov variants (he et al., 2006) . it is noted that high titers of rbd-specific neutralizing antibodies persistently existed in recovered patients in a three-year follow-up study, indicating that the rbd of sars-cov is highly immunogenic in humans (cao et al., 2010) , thus providing the basis for the development of effective subunit vaccines to prevent sars-cov infections in humans. currently, this rbdbased subunit vaccine is in preclinical testing in small animal and primate animal challenge models, in anticipation of manufacture for clinical evaluation in the next five years (jiang et al., 2012a) .the above summary suggests a paradigm that supports the development of a mers-cov subunit vaccine, indicating that the rbd of mers-cov is an important target for the development of mers-cov subunit vaccines and will, like its sars-cov counterpart, induce strong neutralizing antibody responses against mers-cov infection (du et al., 2009a; zhu et al., 2013) . based on our previous experience in developing sars-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines, we rapidly identified the rbd of mers-cov as an essential vaccine target for mers. we have optimized the mers-cov rbd region and identified a critical neutralizing domain, among the five rbd fragments tested, that induces the highest neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov infection (ma et al., 2014b) . our progress in the development of mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines is summarized below.mers vaccine development-to identify the rbd of mers-cov, we initially aligned the sequences of mers-cov s protein with those of sars-cov s protein and found that residues 377-662 in the mers-cov s protein shared similar core structures with sars-cov rbd, increasing the likelihood that the rbd of mers-cov might be located in this region . a recombinant protein (s377-662-fc) containing residues 377-662 of mers-cov s protein fused with fc fragment of human igg was expressed in the culture supernatant of mammalian cell 293t for the purpose of forming conformational structures and, thus, increasing immunogenicity (du et al., 2013c) .as expected, the expressed recombinant protein was able to form a high molecular-weight molecule, as shown in nonboiled samples in sds-page (fig. 3a, left) , which was recognized by mers-cov s1-specific antibodies (fig. 3a, right) . detection of the binding of s377-662-fc with the receptor of mers-cov, dpp4, by co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that this protein bound significantly to soluble dpp4 (sdpp4) and cell-associated dpp4 in dpp4-expressing huh-7 cells, being recognized by anti-dpp4 and anti-mers-cov-s1 antibodies, respectively (fig. 3b ). elisa and flow cytometry analyses indicated that s377-662-fc bound to sdpp4 and huh-7 in a dose-dependent manner (du et al., 2013c) . these data suggest that the expressed recombinant protein formed conformational structures and that the predicted 286-amino acid fragment contained mers-cov rbd.further evaluation of the immunogenicity of the identified mers-cov rbd demonstrated that the expressed recombinant s377-662-fc protein induced mers-cov rbd-specific antibodies in mice subcutaneously (s.c.) immunized after two vaccinations, resulting in the effective neutralization of mers-cov infection in vero e6 cells in vitro (du et al., 2013c) , indicating that this region may serve as an essential target for developing mers subunit vaccines. immune responses and neutralizing antibodies induced by the i.n. route with those elicited by the s.c. route.evaluation of the humoral immune response demonstrated that intranasal boost vaccination of s377-662-fc induced levels of mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies, as well as igg1 (th2) and igg2a (th1) subtypes, as high as those induced via the s.c. route, although igg antibody elicited through the i.n. pathway proved to be relatively lower than that elicited through the s.c. route after a single vaccination (ma et al., 2014a) . similar to immunization by the s.c. route, intranasal vaccination of s377-662-fc was also capable of eliciting effective long-term igg antibody responses, particularly after multiple vaccinations (fig.  3c ) (ma et al., 2014a) , confirming the ability of s377-662-fc to induce strong humoral immune responses via the mucosal route.comparison of the mucosal immune response illustrated that intranasal vaccination of s377-622-fc induced a significantly higher level of mers-cov s1-specific iga antibodies than that induced through the s.c. route in immunized mouse lungs (fig. 3d) , although the iga level was only slightly higher in immunized mouse sera via the i.n. route compared to the s.c. route (ma et al., 2014a) . these data suggest that immunization of mers-cov s377-662-fc protein induced strong local mucosal immune responses by the i.n. route, rather than the s.c. route.serum neutralizing antibody titers from intranasal vaccination of s377-662-fc protein maintained levels similar to those of the s.c. route after boost vaccination (fig. 3e) . however, it is worth noting that these neutralizing antibodies were significantly higher in immunized mouse lungs in neutralizing mers-cov infections in target vero e6 cells via the i.n. route, rather than the s.c. route (fig. 3f) , potentially because of the higher titers of mucosal iga antibodies induced in the i.n.-immunized mouse lungs (ma et al., 2014a) .it should be noted that s377-662-fc protein was also able to elicit mers-cov s1-specific cellular immune responses in immunized mouse spleens (ma et al., 2014a) , indicating that cellular immune response might also play a role in the prevention of mers-cov infection. importantly, since rbd-induced systemic humoral and mucosal immune responses, neutralizing antibodies in particular, correspond to the protection against sars-cov infection (du et al., 2007) , it is expected that neutralizing antibodies induced by mers-cov rbd protein will correlate well with inhibition of mers-cov infection. nevertheless, based on the ability of mers-cov rbd protein to induce strong systemic and mucosal immune responses with neutralizing activity, it is expected that mers-cov rbd-based vaccine is an effective and safe mucosal candidate for prevention of mers-cov infection.addition to the above identified 286-amino acid fragment containing residues 377-662, three additional fragments, respectively spanning residues 358-588, 367-588, and 367-606 of mers-cov s protein, were defined as mers-cov rbd by other groups (chen et al., 2013b; lu et al., 2013a; mou et al., 2013; wang et al., 2013) . we have also shown that a truncated 212-amino acid fragment spanning s protein residues 377-588 of mers-cov served as a rbd of mers-cov . to identify a critical neutralizing domain in the mers-cov rbd as an ideal mers vaccine candidate, we compared these identified rbd fragments in terms of their antigenicity, dpp4 receptor binding, immunogenicity and neutralizing activity. in order for the recombinant proteins to form suitable conformational structures and maintain sufficient bioactivity, we fused each of these mers-cov rbd fragments to the fc of human igg and expressed the proteins in a mammalian cell expression system (fig. 4a) . previously, this same strategy was implemented and proved to be successful in expressing rbd proteins of sars-cov and influenza virus (du et al., 2011; du et al., 2013d; li et al., 2013) .as expected, all four mers-cov rbd proteins, designated s377-588-fc, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc, and s367-606-fc, respectively, formed dimeric conformational structures and maintained good antigenicity (ma et al., 2014b) , reacting strongly with mers-cov rbdspecific monoclonal antibody mersmab1 developed in our laboratories (fig. 4b ) . although all proteins bound efficiently to sdpp4-and dpp4-expressing huh-7 cells, their binding affinities were notably different, with s377-588-fc as one of the proteins having the highest dpp4-binding activity (fig. 4c) . notably, s377-588-fc also maintained stronger immunogenicity than the other proteins tested, inducing significantly higher igg antibody responses in immunized mice (fig. 4d) , as well as igg1 (th2) and igg2a (th1) subtypes. importantly, s377-588-fc protein was shown to elicit the highest neutralizing antibody titers against infections from mers-cov (fig. 4e ) (ma et al., 2014b) .our study identified a truncated fragment spanning residues 377-588 of mers-cov rbd as a critical neutralizing domain, thus making it an ideal target for the development of subunit vaccines against infections from mers-cov (ma et al., 2014b) . the identification of this critical neutralizing rbd fragment provides a foundation for the rapid development of effective and safe subunit vaccines to prevent the spread of mers-cov in humans or the transmission from infected camels to humans.vaccine candidates that have proved effective against mers-cov infections in in vitro culture conditions need to be evaluated in effective animal challenge models to confirm protective immunity. mers-cov has been shown to cause transient lower respiratory tract infection in rhesus macaques, and infected monkeys demonstrated clinical signs of diseases, virus replication, histological lesions and neutralizing antibody generation (de wit et al., 2013b; yao et al., 2014) , demonstrating that monkeys can be used for testing the efficacy of mers candidate vaccines. however, this mers-cov animal model is not affordable for most researchers based on the high cost for purchasing and maintaining monkeys, making it particularly urgent to develop small animal models of mers-cov infection . studies have shown that mers-cov is susceptible to human and nonhuman primate cell types, including huh-7, a549, calu-3, caco-2 (human), and vero (african green monkey), but it is not susceptible to bhk (hamster), mefc57b16 and 3t3 (mouse), or ferret primary kidney cells (chan et al., 2013a; tao et al., 2013; van doremalen et al., 2014) . these findings correspond to the observation that mers-cov infects human and nonhuman primates, but it does not replicate in small animals, such as syrian hamsters, mice and ferrets author manuscriptauthor manuscript (coleman et al., 2014b; de wit et al., 2013a; devitt, 2013; raj et al., 2014; van doremalen et al., 2014) .although small animal models for mers-cov are still lacking (devitt, 2013) , researchers have made great progress towards the identification and development of an effective small animal model for mers-cov infections. in particular, it has been shown that mice are susceptible to mers-cov infection after prior transduction with an adenoviral vector expressing the receptor of mers-cov, human dpp4, with infected mice developing pneumonia accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration and histopathological changes . thus, such small animal models can provide a practical platform and an affordable means for evaluating the efficacy of current mers-cov vaccines. accordingly, transgenic dpp4 mouse models that integrate human dpp4 genes into the mouse genome are being established in several laboratories (http://www.nature.com/news/biologists-makefirst-mouse-model-for-mers-1.14634) and are expected to be tested for vaccine efficacy in the near future.development of effective vaccines is urgently needed to control the spread of emerging mers-cov infections. while viral vector-based and live-attenuated virus-based vaccines have potential for providing effective immunity, subunit vaccines will offer the safest means for prevention. although subunit-based vaccines might induce less immunogenicity than the other vaccine types, their efficacy can be significantly improved by rational design based on the structural analysis of rbd of mers-cov s protein and by identification of the most stable and critical neutralizing fragment of rbd, while eliminating non-neutralizing epitopes through immunofocusing (ma et al., 2014b) . overall, our strategies in the development of mers-cov rbd-based subunit vaccines will provide useful information for the design of effective vaccines against mers-cov and any other emerging coronaviruses that might cause future pandemics. it is expected that such developed mers candidate vaccines will be tested for efficacy in preventing mers-cov infections in vivo once affordable small animal models for mers-cov have become available. because serologic and neutralization responses against s proteins of mers-cov, sars-cov and other coronaviruses share no, to low, levels of cross-reactivity within and/or across subgroups, it is advisable that mers-cov and other coronavirus vaccines be designed by considering construction of chimeric s protein containing neutralizing epitopes from variant virus strains (agnihothram et al., 2014). , either boiled (denatured) or nonboiled (nondenatured), were subjected to sds-page, followed by coomassie blue staining or western blot, using anti-mers-cov-s1 antibodies (1: 1,000) developed in our laboratories. the protein molecular weight marker (kda) is indicated on the left. (b) co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis of s377-662-fc binding sdpp4, the receptor for mers-cov (left), and cell-associated dpp4 in huh-7 cells (right). the binding affinity was tested using anti-human dpp4 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) and anti-mers-cov-s1 polyclonal antibodies (1: 1,000). (c) comparison of long-term humoral immune responses induced by are presented as mean (igg endpoint titers) ± sd of five mice per group.* indicates significant differences between s377-588-fc and s367-588-fc with other groups (p < 0.05).

dilutions of sera that completely inhibit virus-induced cpe in at least 50% of the wells (nt 50 ). mouse sera were collected at 10 days post-3rd vaccination, and the data are presented as mean (neutralizing antibody titers) ± sd of five mice per group.* indicates significant differences between s377-588-fc and other groups (p < 0.05).the primary sequence of sars-cov-2 protein was retrieved from the ncbi database using accession number mn908947.3 [3] . experimentally known 3d structure of sars-cov-2 s protein (pdb id: 6vsb) and n protein (pdb id: 6vyo) were retrieved from protein data bank [1] . there is no 3d structure of m protein available yet. the predicted interaction conformation between rbd of sars-cov-2 s protein and human ace-2 was retrieved from a very recent report [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . the protein sequence was analyzed for its chemicals and physical properties including gravy (grand average of hydropathicity), half-life, molecular weight, stability index, and amino acid atomic composition via an online tool protparam [33] . tmhmm v2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/tmhmm/) was applied to examine the transmembrane topology of s and m protein. the secondary structure of the sars-cov-2 s, m and n protein was analyzed by psipred [34] . the existence of disulfide-bonds was examined through an online tool dianna v1.1 which uses a trained neural system to make predictions [35] . antigenicity of full-length s, m and n protein were evaluated by vaxijen v2.0 [36] .iedb (immune-epitope-database and analysis-resource) [37] were used to predict linear b-cell epitopes using bepipred and bepipred2.0 with default parameter settings, kolaskar and tongaonkar antigenicity, parker hydrophilicity, chou and fasman beta-turn, and karplus and schulz flexibility. bcepred [38] was also used to predict linear b-cell epitopes using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity, and turns. predicted linear b-cell epitopes by iedb and bcepred were combined to the linear b-cell epitope candidate list. based on the transmembrane topology of s and m protein predicted by tmhmm v2.0, only epitopes on the outer surface remained, and other intracellular epitopes were eliminated. vaxijen 2.0 [36] was applied to evaluate the antigenicity of the remained epitopes.a stringent criterion was used to have epitopes with an antigenicity score of 0.9 viewed adequate to initiate a defensive immune reaction. a b-cell discontinuous epitope forms the antigen-binding interface through fragments scattered along the protein sequence. discotope2.0 [39] with a discotope score threshold of -3.7 was used to predict discontinuous epitopes. as the 3d structure of m protein is not available, open-source pymol was used to examine the positions of selected linear and discontinuous epitopes on the 3d structure of sars-cov-2 s protein or the interacting conformation of s protein rbd and human ace-2 [28] [29] [30] . peptide_binding_to_mhc_class_i_molecules tool of iedb and hla class i set [40] was utilized to predict mhc class i binding t-cell epitopes. peptide_binding_to_mhc_class_ii_molecules tool of iedb and hla class ii set [41] was utilized to predict t-cell epitopes. percentile rank with a threshold of 1% for mhc class i binding epitopes and 10% for mhc class ii binding epitopes were used to filter out peptideallele with weak binding affinity. the antigenicity score of each epitope was calculated by vaxijen v2.0.a high stringent standard was used to filter peptides with antigenicity score larger than or equal to 1, the number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 3 for mhc class i binding epitopes and 5 for mhc class ii binding epitopes. the [43] with the top prediction chosen from a total of 10 epitope-protein interaction reports. pepattract [44] was adopted to estimate the docking score of each peptide with the corresponding hla allele.consurf [45] was used to examine the conservation status for each residue of sars-cov-2 by analyzing the amino acid sequences of s, m, and n protein from seven known coronaviruses including sars-cov- s protein is an important target for vaccine development because of its important function in entering the host cell. m protein and n protein of coronavirus have also been reported to generate immunogenic epitopes. table 2 ). antigenicity analysis of the full-length protein by vaxijen confirmed that they were expected antigens with an antigenicity score of 0.4646 for s protein, 0.5102 for m protein, and 0.5059 for n protein. as s and m proteins are transmembrane protein, the transmembrane protein topologies were therefore predicted by tmhmm for s and m protein, respectively. the residues from 1 to 1213 were exposed on the surface, residues from 1214 to 1236 were inside transmembrane-region and residues from 1237 to 1273 were within the core-region of the s protein ( supplementary fig. 4a ). 1-19 residues were exposed on the surface, with 20-99 residues inside transmembrane-region and 100-222 residues within the core-region of the m protein ( supplementary   fig.5a ). b-cell epitopes can bind to antigen receptors on the surface of b cells, but n protein is inside the virus. considering both s and m protein are transmembrane proteins, we attempted to predict b-cell epitopes only for s and m protein (even there is no neutralization activity well known for m protein) in the downstream analysis. we predicted t-cell epitopes for s, m, and n protein.b-cell epitopes can guide b-cell to recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection.recognition of b-cell epitopes depended on predictions of linear epitopes, antigenicity, hydrophilicity, accessibility of surface, beta-turn, and flexibility [46] . b-cell epitopes of s and m protein were predicted by methods with default settings provided in iedb [37] including . bcepred [38] was used to predict b-cell epitopes using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity, and turns. overall, we obtained a total of 129 and 24 linear b-cell epitopes for s and m protein respectively (supplementary table 3b ). vaxijen v2.0 was further used to estimate the antigenicity of all linear b-cell epitopes, resulting in a total of 80 and 4 epitopes for s and m protein with the antigenicity score larger than or equal to 0.9, respectively (supplementary table 3c ). based on the transmembrane topology of s and m protein predicted by tmhmm v2.0, intracellular epitopes were further eliminated. as a result, 78 linear b-cell epitopes from s protein were retained as candidates (supplementary table 3c 'kcvnfnfngltg' located in the rbd region of the spike head, which is the most exposed region (table   1 ) (fig. 1c) . based on the predicted interacting conformation between rbd domain of sars-cov-2 s protein and ace-2 [27] [28] [29] [30] , the ten linear b-cell epitopes in the spike head substantially overlaps with the interacting surface where ace-2 binds to rbd [28] [29] [30] , demonstrating that an antibody binding to this surface may block viral entry into cells (fig. 1d) . after examining the antigenicity of recently reported bcell epitopes [47, 48] , we discovered that all except for one epitope from orf3a (antigenicity score of qgeikdatpsdf: 1.1542) (supplementary table 3d ) have much less antigenicity score than the ten linear b-cell epitopes we identified from the most exposed region in spike protein (antigenicity scores ranging from 0.9567 to 1.6969) ( table 1) .as there is no 3d structure of m protein available, discontinuous b-cell epitopes were predicted for s protein by discotope 2.0 using a, b, and c chain of the 3d structure of s protein (pdb id: 6vsb). the positions of discontinuous epitopes were mapped on the surface of the 3d structure of s protein ( fig. 2a,   supplementary fig. 6 ). most discontinuous b-cell epitopes were mapped on the fully-exposed 'spike head' region ( fig. 2b ) (supplementary table 4 ) and exposed 'spike stem' region, while a few located in the 'spike root' region (supplementary table 3e ). the main discontinuous b-cell epitopes on the 'spike head' region overlapped with the interacting surface of ace-2 binding to s protein (fig. 2c) , suggesting their roles in blocking virus' fusion with cells.j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o fas the ten linear b-cell epitopes in rbd of the s protein were predicted to be of both non-allergen and nontoxin, we further examined their hydrophobicity, hydropathicity, hydrophilicity, and charge by a support vector machine (svm) based method, toxinpred (supplementary table 5a ). the stability of the ten linear b-cell epitopes was evaluated by the number of peptide-digesting enzymes through the protein digest server (http://db.systemsbiology.net:8080/proteomicstoolkit/proteindigest.html). more non-digesting enzymes predicted for an epitope suggests its potentially higher stability. all the ten linear b-cell epitopes were found to have multiple non-digesting enzymes varying from 2 to 8 enzymes (supplementary table 5b ).peptide_binding_to_mhc_class_i_molecules tool of iedb and hla class i set [40] was utilized to predict t-cell epitopes for s protein. percentile rank with a threshold of 1% was used to filter out peptide-allele with weak binding affinity. the antigenicity score of each peptide was calculated by vaxijen v2.0 to evaluate its antigenicity. a peptide having both high antigenicity score and capacity to bind with a larger number of alleles is considered to have high potentials to initiate a strong defense response. high stringent criteria were used to filter peptides with antigenicity score larger than or equal to 1 and the number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 3. utilizing the evaluating method above, we obtained a total of 27 mhc class-i allele binding peptides from s, m, and n protein (supplementary table 6a allergenicity of t-cell epitopes were assessed by allergen fp 1.0. results showed that two of nine, three of nine, two of nine mhc class-i binding peptides from s, m, and n protein were probably non-allergen, respectively (supplementary table 8a -c). nine of thirteen and nine of thirteen mhc class-ii binding peptides from s and m protein were predicted to be non-allergen, respectively (supplementary table 8a -c). toxicity of t-cell epitopes along with hydrophobicity, hydropathicity, hydrophilicity, and charge was evaluated by toxinpred. all but two t-cell epitopes were predicted to be non-toxin (supplementary table   8a -c). the stability of t-cell epitopes was evaluated through the number of peptides digesting enzymes by the protein digest server. all t-cell epitopes but 'kmkdlsprwy' were found to have multiple nondigesting enzymes varying from 3 to 11 enzymes (supplementary table 9a fig. 8a-b) . fig. 9 ). the highly conserved and exposed residues mainly located from 711 to 1221 in s protein ( supplementary fig. 9 ), from 21 to 204 in m protein ( supplementary   fig. 10) , and from 18 to 311 in n protein ( supplementary fig. 11) . particularly, the epitopes without allergenicity and toxicity containing one functional residue (highly conserved and exposed) included b-cell table 10 ). no mutations were observed in non-allergenic and non-toxic t-cell epitopes from s, m and n protein.the emergence of sars-cov-2 is a serious health threat for the whole society, thus there is an urgent need for drugs and preventative measures. the sars-cov-2 infection is characterized by lung infections with symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. based on the information from cdc (centers for disease control and prevention), the symptoms can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus which can transmit from human to human or from contact with infected surfaces and objects [5] [6] [7] .it is essential to identify immune epitopes as quickly as possible. the s protein is crucial in the fuse and entry of the virus into host cells [1] , therefore it is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies. the specificity of epitope-based vaccines can be enhanced by selecting parts of s protein exposed on the surface [52] . medical biotechnology is important in developing vaccines against sars-cov-2 [18] . while computer-based immune-informatics can improve time and economic effectiveness, and therefore, it is also an essential method in immunogenic analysis and vaccine development.in this study, we characterized the physio-chemical characteristics of the sars-cov-2 viral genome for epitope candidates and adopted an immune-informatics based pipeline with highly stringent criteria to identify s，m and n protein targeted b-and t-cell epitopes that may potentially promote an immune response in the host. the antigenicity, flexibility, solvent accessibility, disulfide bonds of predicted epitopes were evaluated, yielding a small repertoire of potential b-cell epitope and vaccine candidates. allergenicity and toxicity analysis suggested the ten linear b-cell epitopes in rbd region are of non-allergen and nontoxin. stability analysis revealed that they can not be digested by multiple enzymes. also, two mhc class-i and nine mhc class-ii binding t-cell epitopes were predicted to interact with numerous hla alleles and to be highly antigenic. allergenicity, toxicity, and physiochemical properties of t-cell epitopes were analyzed to increase specificity and selectivity. the stability and safety were confirmed by digestion analysis. conservation anlaysis of seven known coronaviruses revealed that rbd region is not conserved.mutations generated from 51,150 sequences of sars-cov-2 in the ngdc database were observed in five of ten linear b-cell epitopes in rbd region. the b-and t-cell (mhc class i and ii) epitopes without mutations would be considered to be vaccine candidates with full potentials of being antigenicity.we predict the b-and t-cell epitopes identified here may assist the development of potent peptide-based vaccines to address the sars-cov-2 challenge. particularly, those epitopes without mutations from the conserved regions could generate immunity that is not only cross-protective across beta coronaviruses but also relatively resistant to ongoing virus evolution [47] . the epitopes predicted here can also potentially be used in the design of more sensitive serological assays for epidemiological or vaccine efficiency assessments. but the replication of sars-cov-2 must be error-prone, which is similar to sars-cov with a reported mutation rate of 4x10 -4 substitutions/site/year [53] . anti-viral vaccines are necessary to be developed before the predicted epitopes are potentially obsolete. moreover, our immune-informatics based pipeline also provides a framework to identify b-and t-cell epitopes for sars-cov-2, but not limited to a specific virus. at the same time, we also have to mention that there are limitations in predicting t-cell epitopes. the prerequisite that an epitope can elicit t cell response is the epitope can bind to both mhc alleles and t cell receptors. however, the binding prediction between mhc alleles and an epitope is relatively more accurate, and the binding between an epitope and t cell receptors is extremely difficult to j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f be predicted. in short, these results here will be useful to guide the design and evaluation of efficient and specific serological assays against epitopes, as well as help prioritize vaccine target designs during this unprecedented crisis [54] . coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a highly contagious respiratory disease resulting from a life-threatening novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). it has spread rapidly throughout the globe, causing 3.8 million infections and 260 thousand of deaths by early may 2020 [1, 2] . sars-cov-2 is an enveloped rna virus that belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the family coronaviridae, which includes well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) as well as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) [3] . the advancement in the management of these coronaviruses and other viruses like influenza virus h1n1 and ebola infections have provided insight into treating covid-19. more than 300 active clinical trials for covid-19 are being performed [4, 5] .chloroquine [6, 7] and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine [8] , lopinavir/ritonavir [9] [10] [11] , and remdesivir [7, 12] , developed for treating malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and ebola virus, respectively, have provided some benefits to treat covid-19 and are being tested in ongoing trials.although covid-19 is less fatal than the sars and mers, older patients with comorbidities tend to experience more severe symptoms, making them more vulnerable. the majority of sars-cov-2 infected patients displayed mild symptoms and generally have a good prognosis, classified as mild covid-19 [9, 13] . however, a large proportion of patients, especially among older men with underlying chronic diseases, have rapidly progressed to severe covid-19 and suffered from respiratory distress requiring emergent medical interventions [14] . unfortunately, there is no evidence from randomized clinical trials supporting vaccines or efficient treatment for covid-19 [4, 5] .additionally, recent studies have shown the important roles of host immune responses in protection and the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, for instance, sars-cov, mers-cov, and influenza a viruses [15, 16] . liao et al. [17] reported that increased immune cell recruitment in covid-19 patients suggested a crucial role of cd8 + t cells in successful viral control, and proposed support therapeutic strategies that target the myeloid cell compartment to treat covid-19-associated inflammation. however, little is known about drug screens of disease-relevant cell types.drug repurposing is an essential and universal strategy in the development of new drugs [18] . it may facilitate the discovery of new mechanisms of action for existing drugs, which is less time-consuming and cost-effective let alone the existing pharmaceutical supply chains for formulation and distribution [19, 20] . considering that an rna virus exhibits a considerable degree of sequence variation, drugs targeting host factors may cause less mutational resistance with more effective and broad anti-virus spectrum potential. hence, there is an urgent need to identify potential therapeutics with new strategies for emerging infectious diseases, and repurposing clinically assessed drugs represents one of the most practicable strategies for the rapid identification of treatments to combat covid-19.in this study, we analyzed a publicly available single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) dataset of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) collected from mild and severe cases as well as bulk rna-seq of balf in covid-19 patients from different experiments ( figure 1 ). data mining was performed by using the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (lincs) [21] , a drug perturbation database, to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease. a total of 281 candidates of different courses of covid-19 independent of cell subtypes were identified, 10 of which were in clinical trials of covid-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir [22] , dexamethasone, niclosamide, lenalidomide, hydrocortisone, metformin, atorvastatin, sildenafil, and verapamil. subsequently, we utilized the side effect prediction based on l1000 (sep-l1000) project to predict adverse drug reactions (adrs) and constructed drug-adr association [23, 24] .our findings may aid in the rapid preclinical and clinical evaluation of these therapeutics and can provide an important drug discovery pipeline to accelerate and facilitate the development of potential treatments for covid-19.the gene-barcode matrix files of all 6 donors containing 3 mild cases and 3 severe cases (lung balf) and 3 healthy control (lung tissues) were downloaded from the ncbi gene expression omnibus database (accession id: gse145926) [17] . all expression matrices were loaded in r statistical analysis platform using seurat v3 [25] and keeping cells with gene number between 200 and 6000, unique molecular identifier (umi) count above 1000 and mitochondrial gene percentage below 0.1. a total of 43,914 cells collected from three healthy subjects, three mild covid-19 patients, and three severe covid-19 patients, were used for the analyses. we also collected a list of differentially expressed genes (degs) in sars-cov-2-infected lung balf using a bulk rna-seq analysis to compare against the single-cell-based data. this deg list was obtained from the chinese national genomics data center (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/; accession id: cra002390) [26] .the lognormalize method in seurat was used for normalizing filtered gene-barcode matrix.principal component analysis (pca) was done by using the top 2,000 most variable genes. then uniform manifold approximation and projection (umap) was performed on the top 50 principal components for visualizing the cells, and graph-based clustering was performed on the pcareduced data with seurat v3 [27] .mast in seurat v3 was used to perform differential analysis. degs were identified by comparing each cluster between all of the three groups. genes with average log2fc > 0.25 and adjusted p-value < 0.05 were deemed as degs.degs were first sorted by the log2fc values and then the upregulated and downregulated genes were chosen to identify drugs and compounds against the lincs database using the connectivity map linked user environment (clue) platform [21] . the drug connectivity score (cs) with a negative value smaller than -90 was used to determine candidate drugs and compounds. covid-19 database from the international clinical trials registry platform (ictrp) (https://www.who.int/ictrp/en/, updated on may 5 th , 2020) was searched for clinical trials information associated with these drugs.both on-label and off-label adverse drug reactions (adrs) of the candidate drugs were collected from the sep-l1000 database (https://maayanlab.net/sep-l1000/). the sep-l1000 data include on-label adrs of fda-approved drugs collected from sider [28] and off-label adrs from the pharmgkb database [29] based on the post-marketing adr reports in the fda adverse event report system (faers).our study highlighted the identification of different therapeutic effects in the varied disease course. with the high variability of the cellular compartments underlying disease progression, our drug repurposing profiles from major cell subtypes included t, b, and nk cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells. a total of 9 scrna-seq balf samples, including 3 healthy cases, 3 mild cases, and 3 severe cases, were collected from publicly available scrna-seq data (supplemental table s1 ). after quality filtering, approximately 250,000 gene expression values from 44,000 cells were collected. the clustering analysis identified six major clusters of macrophage, nk figure s1 ), which was determined based on the unique signature genes cd68 (macrophage cell), il7r and cd4 (cd4+ t cell), cd8a (cd8+ t cell), ms4a1 (b cells), tppp3 (epithelial cells), respectively (supplemental figure s2 ). we then compared these six major clusters across the healthy, mild, and severe covid-19 cases and identified differentially expressed genes between any of the two courses (supplemental tables s2-s4 ).connecting to the lincs database of small-molecule perturbations on gene expression, we identified candidate drugs and compounds that can reverse these upregulated and downregulated genes via the clue platform. the closer the cs is to -100, a score indicating a complete reversal, the higher chance identification of drug-adverse effect associations with upregulated or downregulated degs, in other words, drugs may show a better response to reverse expression of degs upregulated or downregulated in major cell subtypes in the balf. there were a total of 281 candidates selected out by clue with cs lower than -90 based on degs among all three comparisons between two courses (supplementary table s5 ). to enable prioritization of known drugs for preclinical and clinical evaluation for the therapy efficiency of sars-cov-2, a summary of the most among major cell subtypes during the patients' disease course and the publicly disclosed clinical trial phases are annotated in tables 1-3. supplementary table s5 provides the complete list of potential anti-coronavirus agents from the current analysis, focusing on the fda approved drugs and experimental agents that have been already tested in clinical trials.to select candidates for mild cases, drugs and compounds were ranked according to their css (supplementary table s6 ), 133 candidate drugs were identified compared to controls (mild vs healthy group), and 53 of them involved in more than one cell subtype ( (table 1) , including hiv protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir [22] combination (phase 4), glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (phase 3/4) [30] , dna replication inhibitor niclosamide (phase 2/3) and antineoplastic lenalidomide (phase 4).the tubulin inhibitor flubendazole, widely used in treating intestinal parasites, is a potent inducer of autophagy initiation and can decrease infection of dendritic cells with the hiv [31] .azacytidine could partially reverse the aberrant dna methylation, a phase i clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy has been conducted to assess its therapeutic effects in children with leukemia, and in combination with apr-246 for myelodysplastic syndrome is in phase 3 clinical trial [32] . the bcl inhibitor abt-737 exhibits potential pro-apoptotic and antineoplastic activities [33, 34] . lopinavir is widely used for the treatment of hiv, formulated in combination with ritonavir that can increase the half-life of lopinavir [9] [10] [11] .repurposing analysis in severe covid-19 patients 60 potent drugs were also selected in severe cases compared to controls (severe vs healthy group) according to their average cs between the replicates, and 25 of them involved in more than one cell subtype ( figure 2b , supplementary tables s8 & s9) . as listed in table 2 protein synthesis inhibitor brefeldin-a has used inhibit entry of some viruses, like human papillomavirus and polyomavirus [35] , and egress of others, such as herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses [36] . indirubin, an active ingredient of traditional chinese medicine (tcm) "danggui longui wan", has potent activity against myelocytic leukemia [37] and therapeutic potential on iav-infection [38] .a total of 111 candidate drugs were identified in severe cases compared to mild ones (severe vs mild group), 39 of them involved in more than one cell subtype ( figure 2c , supplementary tables s10 & s11). as listed in table 3 , nine drugs (those for which drugs selected out in three separate cell types or more), including fostamatinib (syk inhibitor), ver-155008 (hsp inhibitor), ku-0063794 (mtor inhibitor), pik-90 (pi3k inhibitor), linsitinib (igf-1 inhibitor), tak-715 (p38 mapk inhibitor), y-27632 (rho-associated kinase inhibitor), az-628 (raf inhibitor) and lestaurtinib (flt3 inhibitor). in this group, except lopinavir, we also following listed 4 drugs in clinical trials for the treatment of covid-19 in table 3 syk inhibitor fostamatinib produced clinically-meaningful responses for adult persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia in two parallel, phase 3 randomized trials [39] . hsp inhibitor ver-155008 regulates kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic replication and highlights the potential to be a novel antiviral agent [40] . flt3 inhibitor lestaurtinib obtained orphan drug approval from the fda for acute myeloid leukemia [41] and in a phase ii trial of advanced multiple myeloma and phase i trials of prostate cancer.as shown in figures 3a & 3b and supplemental table s5 , lopinavir was the only one identified in all three comparisons, and interestingly, ritonavir was common in two analyses. there were 23 additional common drugs, such as sb-216763, abt-737, jte-907, brefeldin-a, pkcbetainhibitor, indirubin, gw-441756, flubendazole, tyrphostin-ag-1478, memantine, calyculin, kinetin-riboside, ascorbyl-palmitate, on-01910, mirin, verrucarin-a, emetine, tpca-1, rhokinase-inhibitor-iii[rockout], pd-158780 and nvp-auy922. for example, the glycogen synthase kinase inhibitor sb-216763 acts as neuroprotectant [42] and prevents cardiac ischemia [43] .jte-907 is a cannabinoid receptor inverse agonist producing anti-inflammatory effects [44] .to further demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy, we have accomplished the identification of therapeutic drugs by transcriptional changes in balf of covid-19 patients with a bulk rna-seq data [26] . ten efficient candidates were identified using the same analysis pipeline, two of which, including glycogen synthase kinase inhibitor sb-216763 and ppar receptor antagonist gw-6471, were also included in the single-cell-based candidate lists (supplemental table s12 ).further investigations are necessary to characterize the adrs which are a central consideration during drug development [45] . therefore, we conducted a computational approach using the sep-l1000 database to predictive relationships between drugs and the emergence of adrs (supplemental tables s13 s14). figure 4 shows a heatmap of the top 50 drug-adr association for on-label ( figure 4a ) and off-label ( figure 4b ) adrs. these findings highlighted drug-adr associations and may lead to inform clinical decisions regarding treatments for covid-19.covid-19 has spread rapidly, and no proven vaccine or drug has yet been identified to treat it.generally speaking, there are several ways to control or prevent emerging coronavirus disease, including antivirals, small-molecule drugs, biologics, and vaccines [4, 5] . due to the lack of effective therapeutic agents and long development cycles of vaccines, it is, therefore, reasonable to consider repurposing existing drugs and compounds for covid-19.drug repurposing is a potentially important strategy for the discovery of existing medicines to tackle covid-19 [18] . gordon et al. [46] identified 332 high-confidence sars-cov-2human protein-protein interactions for drug repurposing. an additional study [47] tested the antiviral activity of 20 fda approved drugs against sars-cov-2 that previously shown to inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov. another research team [48] conducted a high-throughput analysis of the reframe library to identify 30 candidates existing drugs that prevent the covid-19 virus from replicating in mammalian cells. in a study [49] based on public data of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and the database lincs, several drugs were identified on covd-19 targets ace2.host immune responses are particularly important in the protection and pathogenesis of the respiratory viral infections like sars-cov, mers-cov, and influenza a viruses [15, 16] . liao et al. [17] observed that t and nk cells accumulated, epithelial cells decreased in covid-19 patients compared to controls, meanwhile, macrophages dysregulated and the cell compartments differed in mild and severe disease courses, more t and nk cells decreased in severe cases but cd8 + t cells increased in mild cases. however, drug screening of disease-relevant cell types is still unclear.here, we analyzed publicly available data of covid-19 patients and performed data mining by using the lincs l1000 database to identify potential therapies for covid-19 disease and sep-l1000 database to predict side effects. our approach is different from previous methods for drug repurposing for coronavirus, since it does not merely rapidly identify likely effective therapeutic agents in preventing or treating covid-19, but tries to filter out specific medications during the patients' disease courses. furthermore, the data and transcriptome are derived from human samples from real patients, two independent sets of experiments. lastly, we explore the underlying risk factors associated with some side effects of the candidates. overall, our data will guide the future development of therapies for the different durations of covid-19 and other viral respiratory infections.this study has several limitations to note. first, the public scrna-seq data had a small number of clinical samples (n=9) without available patient information, which makes comparisons between studies difficult. with the fast pace and expected large number of published literature using other patient samples, our candidate lists may need to be revised. second, our findings may not apply to children because all the sequencing data were from adults. future work on large-scale data mining would help us in better identification of antiviral drugs.the pandemic of covid-19 represents the greatest global public health crisis in this generation.so far, no proven vaccines and therapies have been identified. based on the study, we thoroughly investigated potential candidates for the treatment in covid-19 progression and predicted some possible adverse effects. the findings can guide additional repurposing studies, tailored for different stages of disease progression.the authors declare that they have no competing interests.jh, ch, mw and kg designed the project, collected data, performed analysis, and prepared figures. kg and zw collected data, prepared figures, and wrote the manuscript. pg performed analysis and prepared tables. qp revised the manuscript.the work was partially supported by the national institutes of health (p20gm113123) pilot grant to j.h.all the codes and data are available at https://github.com/guokai8/covid19/ table 1 . a list of potential drugs for treating covid-19 based on lincs database and degs between mild and healthy samples in b, cd4 + t, cd8 + t, epithelial, nk cells, and macrophage. connectivity scores were calculated from the clue platform. asterisk (*) represents the clinical trial for its efficacy in covid-19 disease.

against the lincs database by using the clue platform. candidates are selected which canan emerging infectious disease, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) caused by mers coronavirus (mers-cov), was first identified in 2012 in saudi arabia [1] , and has since spread to other countries, including the united states. as of july 14, 2014, there have been 834 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 288 deaths, (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 2014_07_14_mers/en/), raising serious concerns over its pandemic potential [2, 3] . with bats and dromedary camels as its likely natural reservoir and intermediate transmission host, respectively [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , mers-cov poses a long-term threat to human health [12, 13] . thus, the need for the development of effective prophylactic strategies, such as vaccines, to control the further spread of mers-cov is urgent.the spike (s) protein of mers-cov plays important roles in mediating viral entry to host cells [14] . as the first step of cell entry, a defined receptor-binding domain (rbd) in the spike proteins binds to its functional receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), on the host cell surface for viral attachment [15] . several versions of mers-cov rbd fragments have been identified by different groups. these rbd fragments encompass spike residues 358-588, 367-588, 377-588, and 367-606, respectively [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . extensive studies have found that the spike rbd of sars coronavirus (sars-cov), which caused the sars epidemic in 2002-2003 [21,22] , is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding domain and an attractive subunit vaccine candidate against sars-cov infection [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . it is likely that the mers-cov rbd could also serve as a subunit vaccine candidate against mers-cov infection. indeed, it was previously shown that some of these mers-cov rbd fragments are immunogenic in animals, resulting in neutralizing antibody responses [17, 18] . however, it is not clear which one of these rbd fragments represents an ideal vaccine candidate and what is the mechanism behind the potential differences in the neutralizing abilities of these rbd fragments.in this study, we have expressed each of these mers-cov rbd fragments that were fused with fc fragment of human igg, and investigated their receptor binding affinity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential. we have found the rbd fragment with the most neutralizing potential, and explained the mechanism behind it. overall, this study has identified an ideal vaccine candidate for controlling mers-cov infections, and enhanced understanding of design strategies for vial subunit vaccines.four-to six-week-old female balb/c mice and four-to five-month-old female nzw rabbits were used in the study. the animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health. the animal protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments of the new york blood center (permit number: 194.15 ).the construction, expression and purification of recombinant mers-cov rbd fragments with fc of human igg were done as previously described with some modifications [18, 29] . briefly, genes encoding residues 350-588, 358-588, 367-588, 367-606, and 377-588 of mers-cov s protein were respectively amplified by pcr using codon-optimized mers-cov s sequences (genbank: afs88936.1) as template and inserted into the pfuse-higg1-fc2 expression vector (hereinafter named fc; invivogen, san diego, ca). mers-cov s1 (residues 18-725) plus a c-terminal his 6 (s1-his) was amplified and inserted into pjw4303 expression vector (jiangsu taizhou haiyuan protein biotech, co., ltd., china). the recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293t cells (atcc, manassas, va), changed into fresh serum-free dmem (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) 8 h later, and collected for supernatant containing expressed proteins 72 h post-transfection. the recombinant proteins were purified by protein a affinity chromatography (ge healthcare, piscataway, nj) for proteins with fc or ni-nta superflow (qiagen, valencia, ca) for proteins with his tag, according to the manufacturers' instructions.human dpp4 ectodomain (residues 39-766) was expressed and purified as previously described [19] . briefly, recombinant human dpp4 ectodomain containing an n-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a c-terminal his 6 was expressed in insect cells using the bac-to-bac expression system (invitrogen), secreted into cell culture medium, and subsequently purified by ni-nta affinity column and superdex200 gel filtration column (ge healthcare).the purified mers-cov rbd fragments were analyzed by sds-page and western blot as previously described [29, 30] . briefly, the boiled and nonboiled proteins were separated by 10% tris-glycine sds-page gels, followed by transferring to nitrocellulose membranes. after blocking overnight at 4°c using 5% non-fat milk in pbst, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mers-cov s-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000). after three washes, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg (1:3,000, invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature, and the signals were visualized using ecl western blot substrate reagents and amersham hyperfilm (ge healthcare).the binding of mers-cov rbd fragments with dpp4 was performed by coimmunoprecipitation assay as previously described [18] . briefly, recombinant soluble dpp4 (sdpp4) (10 μg) or dpp4-expressing huh-7 cell lysates (5×10 7 /ml) were respectively incubated with mers-cov rbd fragments (10 μg) plus protein a sepharose beads at 4°c for 1 h, followed by washing with lysis buffer and pbs, and boiling for 10 min. the samples were subjected to sds-page and western blot analysis, followed by detection using anti-dpp4 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) and mers-cov s1-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000), respectively.mice were immunized with mers-cov rbd fragments following a previously described protocol [18, 29] . briefly, mice were prime-vaccinated (subcutaneously, s.c.) with 10 μg/ mouse of recombinant mers-cov rbd fragments in the presence of montanide isa 51 adjuvant (seppic, fairfield, nj), and boosted twice with the same immunogen and adjuvant at 3-week (21 days) intervals. sera from 10 days post-last vaccination (52 days) were heatinactivated at 56°c for 30 minutes, and detected for mers-cov s-specific antibody response and neutralizing antibodies. sera from 0, 10, 31, and 136 days post-initial immunization of s377-588-fc were also tested for mers-cov s-specific antibody response.the rabbit immunization (covance research products inc., denver, pa) followed a protocol similar to that of mice with some modifications. briefly, rabbits were prime-vaccinated with mers-cov s377-588-fc fragment (250 μg/rabbit) plus freund's complete adjuvant and then boosted twice at 3-week intervals with the same immunogen (125 μg/rabbit) plus freund's incomplete adjuvant. sera were collected and tested as above.elisa was carried out to test the binding of mers-cov rbd fragments to sdpp4 as previously described [18] . briefly, 96-well elisa plates were precoated with sdpp4 (4 μg/ml) overnight at 4°c and blocked with 2% non-fat milk at 37°c for 2 h. diluted mers-cov rbd fragments were added to the plates and incubated at 37°c for 1 h, followed by four washes. bound antibodies were incubated with hrp-conjugated anti-human igg (1:3,000, invitrogen) at 37°c for 1 h. the reaction was visualized by substrate 3,3′,5,5′tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) (invitrogen) and stopped by 1n h 2 so 4 . the absorbance at 450 nm (a450) was measured by elisa plate reader (tecan, san jose, ca).the detection of mers-cov s-specific antibody responses in collected mouse sera was performed following a protocol similar to that described above, except for replacing the coating antigen with mers-cov s1-his protein (1 μg/ml), the primary antibody with serially diluted mouse sera, and the secondary antibody with anti-mouse igg-hrp (1:3,000, invitrogen) [31].the standard micro-neutralization assay was used to quantify the neutralizing potential of each of the rbd fragments, as previously described [18, 31, 32] . briefly, serum samples were diluted at serial 2-fold in 96-well tissue culture plates, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with ~100 infectious mers-cov/emc-2012/well before transferring to duplicate wells of vero e6 cells grown in 96-well tissue culture plates. after 72 h of incubation, when the virus control wells exhibited advanced virus-induced cytopathic effect (cpe), the neutralizing capacity of individual serum samples was assessed by determining the presence or absence of cpe. neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely inhibited virus-induced cpe in at least 50% of the wells (nt 50 ).values are presented as mean with standard deviation (sd). statistical significance among different vaccination groups was calculated by student's t-test using stata statistical software. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.five human igg fc-fused fragments representing the defined rbd residues 358-588, 367-588, 367-606, and 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein and the rbd residues 350-588 control were constructed, expressed, and subjected to antigenicity measurement, using the procedures as previously described (fig.1b) [18] . all five rbd fragments were expressed at high levels from culture supernatants of transfected 293t cells and purified to high homogeneity. the c-terminal fc tag strongly promoted formation of rbd dimers, as evidenced by the almost twice of the molecular weight of non-denatured versus denatured proteins (fig. 1c , top). these recombinant rbd fragments reacted strongly with polyclonal antibodies specifically raised in mice against recombinant s1 protein of mers-cov (fig.  1c , bottom), suggesting that they are in their native and antigenic conformation.two alternative assays, co-immunoprecipitation and elisa, were carried out to measure the receptor-binding activities of mers-cov rbd fragments. results from coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that the five mers-cov rbd fragments were coimmunoprecipitated with recombinant sdpp4 protein. two clear bands corresponding to the sizes of dpp4 and respective fc-fused mers-cov rbd fragments were readily revealed with anti-dpp4-and anti-mers-cov s1-specific antibodies, whereas a single band with a molecular weight corresponding to dpp4 was detected in the sample containing only sdpp4 ( fig. 2a, left) . in addition, each of the five mers-cov rbd fragments coimmunoprecipitated cell-associated dpp4 anchored on huh-7 cells, in which target proteins with anticipated sizes were identified using anti-dpp4-and anti-mers-cov s1-specific antibodies, respectively ( fig. 2a, right) . thus, co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that all of the five rbd fragments specifically interact with mers-cov's receptor dpp4. elisa was then performed by adding mers-cov rbd fragments to the plates coated with a fixed amount of sdpp4, followed by identification of the binding affinity based on the od values at 450 nm. while all of the tested mers-cov rbds were capable of binding to sdpp4, we noted the existence of their differential binding capacity, as shown in figure 2b . among the five rbd fragments, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc possessed significantly higher dpp4-binding affinity than s350-588-fc and s367-606-fc at concentrations of 50 and 12.5 μg/ml, respectively. as expected, the control higg-fc protein did not show any specific binding to sdpp4 (fig. 2b) . therefore, the extended n-or cterminus of mers-cov rbd fragments appears to have negative effect on the receptorbinding activity.to evaluate the immunogenicity of the five mers-cov rbd fragments, we immunized mice with each of the rbd fragments according to the dosing strategy described in materials and methods, and detected specific responses of total igg antibody, along with igg1 and igg2a subtypes, in serum specimens of immunized mice. elisa results showed that all five rbd fragments were immunogenic in mice, and induced production of igg antibodies that specifically bind to mers-cov s1 protein without the fusion of fc. particularly, sera from mice immunized with s367-588-fc or s377-588-fc acquired a stronger binding to mers-cov s1 protein than those immunized with the other three rbd fragments, whereas the control samples from pbs-immunized mice revealed negligible binding activity (fig. 3a) , confirming the specificity of such igg antibody response elicited by these rbd fragments. in addition, the endpoint titration of igg antibody response revealed that s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc were more immunogenic than s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc or s367-606-fc in eliciting mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies in mice after 3 vaccinations (fig. 3b) . thus, the extended n-or c-terminus of the mers-cov rbd also reduces the immunogenicity of the rbd fragments.observation of igg subtypes revealed that s350-588-fc, s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc were capable of inducing a significantly higher level of igg1 (th2) antibody response than s367-606-fc, while s350-588-fc and s367-588-fc elicited igg1 antibody significantly higher than s358-588-fc (fig. 3c ). in addition, s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc promoted a significantly higher level of igg2a (th1) antibody response than s367-606-fc, whereas the igg2a antibodies induced by s367-588-fc were also significantly higher than those induced by s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc and s377-588-fc, respectively (fig. 3d) . the above results suggest that s377-588-fc is among the rbd fragments that induced high titers of th1 and th2 antibody response.neutralizing potentials of the five rbd fragments were initially evaluated in immunized mice. results from vero e6-based micro-neutralization showed that each of the five rbd fragments was capable of inducing neutralization antibodies. among them, s377-588-fc induced the highest level of neutralizing antibody response on the 10 th day after the third immunization (fig. 4a) . as expected, sera from pbs-immunized mice did not show neutralizing activity. thus, s377-588-fc has the highest neutralizing potential among the five rbd fragments. furthermore, s377-588-fc was used to immunize rabbits to confirm its neutralizing potential in different animal species. vero e6-based micro-neutralization assay demonstrated that on the 10 th day after the third immunization with s377-588-fc, high titers of neutralizing antibody responses were generated in rabbits (fig. 4b) . therefore, s377-588-fc, the shortest among the five rbd fragments, can produce high-titer neutralizing antibody responses in both mice and rabbits, suggesting that the fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding domain.to elucidate the potential of s377-588-fc as a vaccine candidate, we immunized mice with this protein for a period of 136 days, and observed the kinetics of antibody responses. as expected, increasing titers of igg antibodies were found in mouse sera after initial immunization, and reached the highest titers during 31 and 52 days post-immunization. the antibody titers decreased slightly afterwards, but still maintained at relative high levels (fig.  4c) . these data demonstrated that the fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein is able to induce and maintain rbd-specific immune responses in the vaccinated animals for at least four months, confirming its good potential to be further developed as a subunit mers vaccine.the increasing number of mers cases indicates urgency for the development of effective vaccines against mers-cov infection and disease. among all of the mers-cov structural proteins, the spike protein, particularly its rbd, is an important target for such an effort, due to its proven ability to elicit potent neutralizing antibody response in immunized laboratory animals [33] . indeed, recombinant rbd fragments containing residues 358-588 and 377-662 of mers-cov s have been shown to induce neutralizing antibody response in immunized rabbits and mice, respectively [17, 29] . moreover, a modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing the full-length s protein of mers-cov was also proven effective in vaccinated mice to produce potent neutralizing antibodies and restricted mers-cov infection in vivo [34] . in addition to the aforementioned recombinant proteins and viral vectors, nanoparticles and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles (vrps)-expressing spike protein of mers-cov have also shown great potentials as mers vaccines [35, 36] .in this study, we expressed five different versions of mers-cov rbd fragments based on the previously published studies [16] [17] [18] [19] , and further investigated and compared their receptor binding ability, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential. the fc of human igg was fused to these rbd fragments because the fc tag can enhance the expression, purification, and immunogenicity of viral rbd proteins [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . our results show that the abilities of these rbd fragments to induce immune responses and neutralizing antibodies differ significantly. among these rbd fragments, s377-588-fc demonstrated high receptor-binding affinity, induced high titer igg antibody in mice, elicited the highest titer neutralizing antibodies in mice, and also induced high titer neutralizing antibodies in rabbits.crystal structure of mers-cov rbd reveals that rbd fragment encompassing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein has a stably folded structure with ordered residues on the n-and c-termini. it contains the receptor-binding motif (rbm, residues 484-567) (fig.  5 ) and almost all of the major neutralizing epitopes identified in mers-cov rbd, many of which are specifically recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nabs) [31, [43] [44] [45] . these epitopes are clustered on a protruding ridge in the rbm region of the rbd, and overlap with the dpp4-binding site (fig. 5) [16, 19, 20] .although not yet experimentally confirmed, other regions in the rbm that overlap with the dpp4-binding site may also contain neutralizing epitopes. on the other hand, the regions in the mers-cov spike that do not overlap with the dpp4-binding site likely contain non-neutralizing epitopes. these non-neutralizing epitopes might hinder the production of neutralizing antibodies and may also induce harmful immune responses [46] [47] [48] . the regions in the rbd core structures contribute to the folding and the stability of the whole rbd, and thus they are essential. however, the regions flanking the rbd do not contribute to protein folding or receptor binding. therefore, it is necessary to identify the critical neutralizing epitopes in rbd in the mers-cov spike protein, and exclude non-neutralizing epitopes, without the expense of domain integrity and stability, as a means of "immunofocusing" for vaccine development.it is important to further test the immune efficacy of s377-588-fc in an animal model challenged by mers-cov. non-human primates, such as rhesus macaques, can be infected by mers-cov, showing clinical signs of the disease and histopathological changes in lungs [49, 50] . however, the high cost of purchasing and maintaining the monkeys and performing the experiments in absl-3 facility have prevented us from using this animal model. small animals such as mice, syrian hamsters, and ferrets that can be infected by sars-cov are unsusceptible to mers-cov infection [51] [52] [53] [54] . although mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing human dpp4 can be infected by mers-cov, they did not show significant clinical symptoms of mers [55] . therefore, the in vivo efficacy of this mers-cov rbd-based vaccine candidate will be evaluated in a more sophisticated small animal model once it becomes available.overall, the rbd fragment encompassing residues 377-588 of mers-cov s protein is the ideal subunit vaccine candidate with the capability of inducing strong neutralizing antibodies in different species of animals. therefore, it can be the focus of future development of mers vaccines. furthermore, this study suggests that in vaccine design it maybe helpful to eliminate non-neutralizing epitopes from the rbd fragments to keep the rbd fragments in their most physiological relevant conformation, and also allow the host immune responses to focus on the neutralizing epitopes. (a) co-immunoprecipitation assays, followed by western blot analyses, were performed to determine the binding affinity between the rbd fragments and dpp4 receptor. briefly, purified recombinant rbd fragments were incubated with either 10 μg sdpp4 (left) or dpp4-expressing huh-7 cells (right) in the presence of protein a sepharose beads before subjecting to western blot analysis with either anti-dpp4 (1 μg/ml, top) or anti-mers-cov s1 antibodies (1:1,000, bottom). (b) elisa was carried out to measure the binding affinity between the rbd fragments and recombinant sdpp4. recombinant human igg fc (higg-fc) protein was included as the negative control. there were significant differences between three of the rbd fragments (s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc, and s377-588-fc) and the other two (s350-588-fc and s367-606-fc) both at 50 (*) and 12.5 (#) μg/ml, respectively.sera collected at 10 days post-last immunization with each of the rbd fragments were the subjects to immunogenicity study, with the serum specimens of sham/pbs-immunized mice included as the negative control. the data are presented as mean ± sd from five mice in each group. (a) total igg antibodies specific to mers-cov s1 protein were assessed by elisa. (b) mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies elicited by groups of differentially immunized mice were determined by elisa, and the titers were expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. there were significant differences between two of the rbd fragments (s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc) and the other three (s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc, and s367-606-fc). (c) mers-cov s1-specific igg1 subtype antibody titers of groups of mice immunized with indicated rbd fragments were compared, based on the endpoint analysis by elisa. there were significant differences between three of the rbd fragments (s350-588-fc, s367-588-fc, and s377-588-fc), and s367-606-fc (*), and between two of the rbd fragments (s350-588-fc and s367-588-fc) and s358-588-fc (#). (d) the endpoint titers of mers-cov s1-specific igg2a subtype antibodies derived from mice immunized with different rbd fragments were compared. there were significant differences between four of the rbd fragments (s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc, and s377-588-fc) and s367-606-fc (*), or between s367-588-fc and three of the rbd fragments (s350-588-fc (#), s358-588-fc (■), and s377-588-fc (•), respectively.the aforementioned serum specimens were subjected to vero e6-based micro-neutralization assays against live mers-cov infection. neutralizing antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilutions of specimens tested that resulted in a complete inhibition of virus-induced cpe in at least 50% of the wells (nt 50 ). (a) neutralizing antibody titers in sera of mice immunized with mers-cov rbd fragments. sera from 10 days post-3 rd immunization were used for the test and the data are presented as mean ± sd from five mice in each group. there were significant differences between s377-588-fc and the other four rbd fragments. (b) neutralizing antibody titers in sera of rabbits (r1 and r2) immunized with s377-588-fc protein. the sera from pre-immunization and 10 days post-3 rd immunization were used for the test. the data are presented as mean ± sd from duplicate wells. (c) the endpoint titers of mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies by elisa in s377-588-fc-immunized mouse sera at 0, 10, 31, 52 and 136 days post-immunization. the data are presented as mean ± sd from five mice in each group. mers-cov spike rbd is a well-folded structure, and contains a core structure (in blue) and a receptor-binding motif (rbm; in magenta). helices are drawn as cylinders, and strands as arrows. the crystallized rbd fragment encompasses residues 367 to 588, with the n-and c-terminus labeled as n* and c*, respectively. the n-terminal region of the rbd fragment (from residues 369 to 378) is disordered, as indicated by a dashed line. neutralizing epitopes recognized by known nabs are indicated in rbm.an emerging infectious disease, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) caused by mers coronavirus (mers-cov), was first identified in 2012 in saudi arabia [1] , and has since spread to other countries, including the united states. as of july 14, 2014, there have been 834 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 288 deaths, (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014 07 14 mers/en/), raising serious concerns over its pandemic potential [2, 3] . with bats and dromedary camels as its likely natural reservoir and intermediate transmission host, respectively [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , mers-cov poses a long-term threat to human health [12, 13] . thus, the need for the development of effective prophylactic strategies, such as vaccines, to control the further spread of mers-cov is urgent.the spike (s) protein of mers-cov plays important roles in mediating viral entry to host cells [14] . as the first step of cell entry, a defined receptor-binding domain (rbd) in the spike proteins binds to its functional receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.08.086 0264-410x/© 2014 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. on the host cell surface for viral attachment [15] . several versions of mers-cov rbd fragments have been identified by different groups. these rbd fragments encompass spike residues 358-588, 367-588, 377-588, and 367-606, respectively [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . extensive studies have found that the spike rbd of sars coronavirus (sars-cov), which caused the sars epidemic in 2002-2003 [21, 22] , is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding domain and an attractive subunit vaccine candidate against sars-cov infection [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . it is likely that the mers-cov rbd could also serve as a subunit vaccine candidate against mers-cov infection. indeed, it was previously shown that some of these mers-cov rbd fragments are immunogenic in animals, resulting in neutralizing antibody responses [17, 18] . however, it is not clear which one of these rbd fragments represents an ideal vaccine candidate and what is the mechanism behind the potential differences in the neutralizing abilities of these rbd fragments.in this study, we have expressed each of these mers-cov rbd fragments that were fused with fc fragment of human igg, and investigated their receptor binding affinity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential. we have found the rbd fragment with the most neutralizing potential, and explained the mechanism behind it. overall, this study has identified an ideal vaccine candidate for controlling mers-cov infections, and enhanced understanding of design strategies for vial subunit vaccines.four-to six-week-old female balb/c mice and four-to fivemonth-old female nzw rabbits were used in the study. the animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health. the animal protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments of the new york blood center (permit number: 194.15).the construction, expression and purification of recombinant mers-cov rbd fragments with fc of human igg were done as previously described with some modifications [18, 29] . briefly, genes encoding residues 350-588, 358-588, 367-588, 367-606, and 377-588 of mers-cov s protein were respectively amplified by pcr using codon-optimized mers-cov s sequences (genbank: afs88936.1) as template and inserted into the pfuse-higg1-fc2 expression vector (hereinafter named fc; invivogen, san diego, ca). mers-cov s1 (residues 18-725) plus a c-terminal his 6 (s1-his) was amplified and inserted into pjw4303 expression vector (jiangsu taizhou haiyuan protein biotech, co., ltd., china). the recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293t cells (atcc, manassas, va), changed into fresh serum-free dmem (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) 8 h later, and collected for supernatant containing expressed proteins 72 h post-transfection. the recombinant proteins were purified by protein a affinity chromatography (ge healthcare, piscataway, nj) for proteins with fc or ni-nta superflow (qiagen, valencia, ca) for proteins with his tag, according to the manufacturers' instructions.human dpp4 ectodomain (residues 39-766) was expressed and purified as previously described [19] . briefly, recombinant human dpp4 ectodomain containing an n-terminal honeybee melittin signal peptide and a c-terminal his 6 was expressed in insect cells using the bac-to-bac expression system (invitrogen), secreted into cell culture medium, and subsequently purified by ni-nta affinity column and superdex200 gel filtration column (ge healthcare).the purified mers-cov rbd fragments were analyzed by sds-page and western blot as previously described [29, 30] . briefly, the boiled and nonboiled proteins were separated by 10% tris-glycine sds-page gels, followed by transferring to nitrocellulose membranes. after blocking overnight at 4 • c using 5% non-fat milk in pbst, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mers-cov s-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1000). after three washes, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg (1:3000, invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature, and the signals were visualized using ecl western blot substrate reagents and amersham hyperfilm (ge healthcare).the binding of mers-cov rbd fragments with dpp4 was performed by co-immunoprecipitation assay as previously described [18] . briefly, recombinant soluble dpp4 (sdpp4) (10 g) or dpp4expressing huh-7 cell lysates (5 × 10 7 /ml) were respectively incubated with mers-cov rbd fragments (10 g) plus protein a sepharose beads at 4 • c for 1 h, followed by washing with lysis buffer and pbs, and boiling for 10 min. the samples were subjected to sds-page and western blot analysis, followed by detection using anti-dpp4 monoclonal antibody (1 g/ml, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn) and mers-cov s1-specific polyclonal antibodies (1:1000), respectively.mice were immunized with mers-cov rbd fragments following a previously described protocol [18, 29] . briefly, mice were primevaccinated (subcutaneously, s.c.) with 10 g/mouse of recombinant mers-cov rbd fragments in the presence of montanide isa 51 adjuvant (seppic, fairfield, nj), and boosted twice with the same immunogen and adjuvant at 3-week (21 days) intervals. sera from 10 days post-last vaccination (52 days) were heat-inactivated at 56 • c for 30 min, and detected for mers-cov s-specific antibody response and neutralizing antibodies. sera from 0, 10, 31, and 136 days post-initial immunization of s377-588-fc were also tested for mers-cov s-specific antibody response.the rabbit immunization (covance research products inc., denver, pa) followed a protocol similar to that of mice with some modifications. briefly, rabbits were prime-vaccinated with mers-cov s377-588-fc fragment (250 g/rabbit) plus freund's complete adjuvant and then boosted twice at 3-week intervals with the same immunogen (125 g/rabbit) plus freund's incomplete adjuvant. sera were collected and tested as above.elisa was carried out to test the binding of mers-cov rbd fragments to sdpp4 as previously described [18] . briefly, 96-well elisa plates were precoated with sdpp4 (4 g/ml) overnight at 4 • c and blocked with 2% non-fat milk at 37 • c for 2 h. diluted mers-cov rbd fragments were added to the plates and incubated at 37 • c for 1 h, followed by four washes. bound antibodies were incubated with hrp-conjugated anti-human igg (1:3000, invitrogen) at 37 • c for 1 h. the reaction was visualized by substrate 3,3 ,5,5 -tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) (invitrogen) and stopped by 1 n h 2 so 4 . the absorbance at 450 nm (a450) was measured by elisa plate reader (tecan, san jose, ca). the detection of mers-cov s-specific antibody responses in collected mouse sera was performed following a protocol similar to that described above, except for replacing the coating antigen with mers-cov s1-his protein (1 g/ml), the primary antibody with serially diluted mouse sera, and the secondary antibody with anti-mouse igg-hrp (1:3000, invitrogen) [31] .the standard micro-neutralization assay was used to quantify the neutralizing potential of each of the rbd fragments, as previously described [18, 31, 32] . briefly, serum samples were diluted at serial 2-fold in 96-well tissue culture plates, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with ∼100 infectious mers-cov/emc-2012/well before transferring to duplicate wells of vero e6 cells grown in 96-well tissue culture plates. after 72 h of incubation, when the virus control wells exhibited advanced virus-induced cytopathic effect (cpe), the neutralizing capacity of individual serum samples was assessed by determining the presence or absence of cpe. neutralizing antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely inhibited virus-induced cpe in at least 50% of the wells (nt 50 ).coimmunoprecipitation assays, followed by western blot analyses, were performed to determine the binding affinity between the rbd fragments and dpp4 receptor. briefly, purified recombinant rbd fragments were incubated with either 10 g sdpp4 (left) or dpp4-expressing huh-7 cells (right) in the presence of protein a sepharose beads before subjecting to western blot analysis with either anti-dpp4 (1 g/ml, top) or anti-mers-cov s1 antibodies (1:1000, bottom). (b) elisa was carried out to measure the binding affinity between the rbd fragments and recombinant sdpp4. recombinant human igg fc (higg-fc) protein was included as the negative control. there were significant differences between three of the rbd fragments (s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc, and s377-588-fc) and the other two (s350-588-fc and s367-606-fc) both at 50 (*) and 12.5 (#) g/ml, respectively.values are presented as mean with standard deviation (sd). statistical significance among different vaccination groups was calculated by student's t-test using stata statistical software. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.five human igg fc-fused fragments representing the defined rbd residues 358-588, 367-588, 367-606, and 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein and the rbd residues 350-588 control were constructed, expressed, and subjected to antigenicity measurement, using the procedures as previously described (fig. 1b) [18] . all five rbd fragments were expressed at high levels from culture supernatants of transfected 293 t cells and purified to high homogeneity. the c-terminal fc tag strongly promoted formation of rbd dimers, as evidenced by the almost twice of the molecular weight of non-denatured versus denatured proteins (fig. 1c, top) . these recombinant rbd fragments reacted strongly with polyclonal antibodies specifically raised in mice against recombinant s1 protein of mers-cov (fig. 1c, bottom) , suggesting that they are in their native and antigenic conformation.two alternative assays, co-immunoprecipitation and elisa, were carried out to measure the receptor-binding activities of mers-cov rbd fragments. results from co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that the five mers-cov rbd fragments were coimmunoprecipitated with recombinant sdpp4 protein. two clear bands corresponding to the sizes of dpp4 and respective fc-fused mers-cov rbd fragments were readily revealed with anti-dpp4and anti-mers-cov s1-specific antibodies, whereas a single band with a molecular weight corresponding to dpp4 was detected in the sample containing only sdpp4 ( fig. 2a, left) . in addition, each of the five mers-cov rbd fragments co-immunoprecipitated cell-associated dpp4 anchored on huh-7 cells, in which target proteins with anticipated sizes were identified using anti-dpp4-and anti-mers-cov s1-specific antibodies, respectively ( fig. 2a, right) . thus, co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that all of the five rbd fragments specifically interact with mers-cov's receptor dpp4.elisa was then performed by adding mers-cov rbd fragments to the plates coated with a fixed amount of sdpp4, followed by identification of the binding affinity based on the od values at 450 nm. while all of the tested mers-cov rbds were capable of binding to sdpp4, we noted the existence of their differential binding capacity, as shown in fig. 2b . among the five rbd fragments, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc possessed significantly higher dpp4-binding affinity than s350-588-fc and s367-606-fc at concentrations of 50 and 12.5 g/ml, respectively. as expected, the control higg-fc protein did not show any specific binding to sdpp4 (fig. 2b) . therefore, the extended n-or c-terminus of mers-cov rbd fragments appears to have negative effect on the receptorbinding activity.to evaluate the immunogenicity of the five mers-cov rbd fragments, we immunized mice with each of the rbd fragments according to the dosing strategy described in materials and methods, and detected specific responses of total igg antibody, along with igg1 and igg2a subtypes, in serum specimens of immunized mice. elisa results showed that all five rbd fragments were immunogenic in mice, and induced production of igg antibodies that specifically bind to mers-cov s1 protein without the fusion of fc. particularly, sera from mice immunized with s367-588-fc or s377-588-fc acquired a stronger binding to mers-cov s1 protein than those immunized with the other three rbd fragments, whereas the control samples from pbs-immunized mice revealed negligible binding activity (fig. 3a) , confirming the specificity of such igg antibody response elicited by these rbd fragments. in addition, the endpoint titration of igg antibody response revealed that s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc were more immunogenic than s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc or s367-606-fc in eliciting mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies in mice after 3 vaccinations (fig. 3b) . thus, the extended n-or c-terminus of the mers-cov rbd also reduces the immunogenicity of the rbd fragments. fig. 3 . immunogenicity of mers-cov rbd fragments. sera collected at 10 days post-last immunization with each of the rbd fragments were the subjects to immunogenicity study, with the serum specimens of sham/pbs-immunized mice included as the negative control. the data are presented as mean ±sd from five mice in each group. (a) total igg antibodies specific to mers-cov s1 protein were assessed by elisa. (b) mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies elicited by groups of differentially immunized mice were determined by elisa, and the titers were expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. there were significant differences between two of the rbd fragments (s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc) and the other three (s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc, and s367-606-fc). (c) mers-cov s1-specific igg1 subtype antibody titers of groups of mice immunized with indicated rbd fragments were compared, based on the endpoint analysis by elisa. there were significant differences between three of the rbd fragments (s350-588-fc, s367-588-fc, and s377-588-fc), and s367-606-fc (*), and between two of the rbd fragments (s350-588-fc and s367-588-fc) and s358-588-fc (#). (d) the endpoint titers of mers-cov s1-specific igg2a subtype antibodies derived from mice immunized with different rbd fragments were compared. there were significant differences between four of the rbd fragments (s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc, and s377-588-fc) and s367-606-fc (*), or between s367-588-fc and three of the rbd fragments (s350-588-fc (#), s358-588-fc ( ), and s377-588-fc (᭹)), respectively.observation of igg subtypes revealed that s350-588-fc, s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc were capable of inducing a significantly higher level of igg1 (th2) antibody response than s367-606-fc, while s350-588-fc and s367-588-fc elicited igg1 antibody significantly higher than s358-588-fc (fig. 3c ). in addition, s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc, s367-588-fc and s377-588-fc promoted a significantly higher level of igg2a (th1) antibody response than s367-606-fc, whereas the igg2a antibodies induced by s367-588-fc were also significantly higher than those induced by s350-588-fc, s358-588-fc and s377-588-fc, respectively (fig. 3d) . the above results suggest that s377-588-fc is among the rbd fragments that induced high titers of th1 and th2 antibody response.neutralizing potentials of the five rbd fragments were initially evaluated in immunized mice. results from vero e6-based microneutralization showed that each of the five rbd fragments was capable of inducing neutralization antibodies. among them, s377-588-fc induced the highest level of neutralizing antibody response on the 10th day after the third immunization (fig. 4a ). as expected, sera from pbs-immunized mice did not show neutralizing activity. thus, s377-588-fc has the highest neutralizing potential among the five rbd fragments. furthermore, s377-588-fc was used to immunize rabbits to confirm its neutralizing potential in different animal species. vero e6-based micro-neutralization assay demonstrated that on the 10th day after the third immunization with s377-588-fc, high titers of neutralizing antibody responses were generated in rabbits (fig. 4b) . therefore, s377-588-fc, the shortest among the five rbd fragments, can produce high-titer neutralizing antibody responses in both mice and rabbits, suggesting that the fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding domain.to elucidate the potential of s377-588-fc as a vaccine candidate, we immunized mice with this protein for a period of 136 days, and observed the kinetics of antibody responses. as expected, increasing titers of igg antibodies were found in mouse sera after initial immunization, and reached the highest titers during 31 and 52 days post-immunization. the antibody titers decreased slightly afterwards, but still maintained at relative high levels (fig. 4c) . these data demonstrated that the fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein is able to induce and maintain rbdspecific immune responses in the vaccinated animals for at least four months, confirming its good potential to be further developed as a subunit mers vaccine.the increasing number of mers cases indicates urgency for the development of effective vaccines against mers-cov infection and disease. among all of the mers-cov structural proteins, the spike protein, particularly its rbd, is an important target for such an effort, due to its proven ability to elicit potent neutralizing antibody response in immunized laboratory animals [33] . indeed, recombinant rbd fragments containing residues 358-588 and 377-662 of mers-cov s have been shown to induce neutralizing antibody response in immunized rabbits and mice, respectively [17, 29] . moreover, a modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing the full-length s protein of mers-cov was also proven effective in vaccinated mice to produce potent neutralizing antibodies and restricted mers-cov infection in vivo [34] . in addition to the aforementioned recombinant proteins and viral vectors, nanoparticles and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles the aforementioned serum specimens were subjected to vero e6-based micro-neutralization assays against live mers-cov infection. neutralizing antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilutions of specimens tested that resulted in a complete inhibition of virus-induced cpe in at least 50% of the wells (nt50). (a) neutralizing antibody titers in sera of mice immunized with mers-cov rbd fragments. sera from 10 days post-3rd immunization were used for the test and the data are presented as mean ± sd from five mice in each group. there were significant differences between s377-588-fc and the other four rbd fragments. (b) neutralizing antibody titers in sera of rabbits (r1 and r2) immunized with s377-588-fc protein. the sera from pre-immunization and 10 days post-3rd immunization were used for the test. the data are presented as mean ± sd from duplicate wells. (c) the endpoint titers of mers-cov s1-specific igg antibodies by elisa in s377-588-fc-immunized mouse sera at 0, 10, 31, 52, and 136 days post-immunization. the data are presented as mean ± sd from five mice in each group.(vrps)-expressing spike protein of mers-cov have also shown great potentials as mers vaccines [35, 36] .in this study, we expressed five different versions of mers-cov rbd fragments based on the previously published studies [16] [17] [18] [19] , and further investigated and compared their receptor binding ability, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential. the fc of human igg was fused to these rbd fragments because the fc tag can enhance the expression, purification, and immunogenicity of viral rbd proteins [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . our results show that the abilities [19] . mers-cov spike rbd is a well-folded structure, and contains a core structure (in blue) and a receptorbinding motif (rbm; in magenta). helices are drawn as cylinders, and strands as arrows. the crystallized rbd fragment encompasses residues 367 to 588, with the n-and c-terminus labeled as n* and c*, respectively. the n-terminal region of the rbd fragment (from residues 369 to 378) is disordered, as indicated by a dashed line. neutralizing epitopes recognized by known nabs are indicated in rbm. (for interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) of these rbd fragments to induce immune responses and neutralizing antibodies differ significantly. among these rbd fragments, s377-588-fc demonstrated high receptor-binding affinity, induced high titer igg antibody in mice, elicited the highest titer neutralizing antibodies in mice, and also induced high titer neutralizing antibodies in rabbits.crystal structure of mers-cov rbd reveals that rbd fragment encompassing residues 377-588 of mers-cov spike protein has a stably folded structure with ordered residues on the n-and c-termini. it contains the receptor-binding motif (rbm, residues 484-567) (fig. 5) and almost all of the major neutralizing epitopes identified in mers-cov rbd, many of which are specifically recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nabs) [31, [43] [44] [45] . these epitopes are clustered on a protruding ridge in the rbm region of the rbd, and overlap with the dpp4-binding site (fig. 5 ) [16, 19, 20] .although not yet experimentally confirmed, other regions in the rbm that overlap with the dpp4-binding site may also contain neutralizing epitopes. on the other hand, the regions in the mers-cov spike that do not overlap with the dpp4-binding site likely contain non-neutralizing epitopes. these non-neutralizing epitopes might hinder the production of neutralizing antibodies and may also induce harmful immune responses [46] [47] [48] . the regions in the rbd core structures contribute to the folding and the stability of the whole rbd, and thus they are essential. however, the regions flanking the rbd do not contribute to protein folding or receptor binding. therefore, it is necessary to identify the critical neutralizing epitopes in rbd in the mers-cov spike protein, and exclude non-neutralizing epitopes, without the expense of domain integrity and stability, as a means of "immunofocusing" for vaccine development.it is important to further test the immune efficacy of s377-588-fc in an animal model challenged by mers-cov. non-human primates, such as rhesus macaques, can be infected by mers-cov, showing clinical signs of the disease and histopathological changes in lungs [49, 50] . however, the high cost of purchasing and maintaining the monkeys and performing the experiments in absl-3 facility have prevented us from using this animal model. small animals such as mice, syrian hamsters, and ferrets that can be infected by sars-cov are unsusceptible to mers-cov infection [51] [52] [53] [54] . although mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing human dpp4 can be infected by mers-cov, they did not show significant clinical symptoms of mers [55] . therefore, the in vivo efficacy of this mers-cov rbd-based vaccine candidate will be evaluated in a more sophisticated small animal model once it becomes available.overall, the rbd fragment encompassing residues 377-588 of mers-cov s protein is the ideal subunit vaccine candidate with the capability of inducing strong neutralizing antibodies in different species of animals. therefore, it can be the focus of future development of mers vaccines. furthermore, this study suggests that in vaccine design it maybe helpful to eliminate non-neutralizing epitopes from the rbd fragments to keep the rbd fragments in their most physiological relevant conformation, and also allow the host immune responses to focus on the neutralizing epitopes.the authors declared no conflict of interest.the recent pandemic of novel coronavirus has already affected thousands of people and is continuing to spread around the world. this virus is called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (sars-cov-2) and the disease caused is called 'coronavirus disease 2019' . as of 5 may 2020, a total of 3,517,345 confirmed clinical episodes of covid-19 and 243,401 deaths have been reported worldwide (who 2020a) . most sars-cov-2-infected people experience mild to moderate respiratory distress and generally recover without requiring any special treatment. however, older people (generally [60 years of age), and those with underlying medical complications like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious symptoms like acute respiratory disease and multiorgan failure, ultimately leading to death (lai et al. 2020 ). sars-cov-2 belongs to the same family as that of sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and mers (middle east respiratory syndrome) viruses that were responsible for epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively (lu et al. 2020) . the genomes of sars-cov-2 is a single positive-strand rna and codes for similar structural protein as of sars, giving rise to a debate about whether it is a laboratory engineered sars virus or a naturally evolved new virus. the sequence analysis of its rna made available by china in the public database showed that it is a novel virus that originated possibly from bats through natural evolution (andersen et al. 2020) . however, how it got transmitted from bats to humans with such high transmission rates from humans to humans is still ambiguous.for infection into human cells, the receptor-binding domain of spike protein (s) present on the envelope of the virus binds to ace2 protein present on human cells, initiating the entry process. this binding induces large conformational change in s protein that leads to exposure of its proteolytic site. the proteolytic site is then cleaved by a protease, causing the fusion of the viral envelope to the host cell membrane, completing the entry of the virus into a human cell. further, it is shown that the s protein of sars-cov-2 has a higher binding affinity with ace2 as compared to sars (wrapp et al. 2020) . based on these results, it could be concluded that sars-cov-2 is a variant of sars; however, the sars-cov-2 genome has additional features like the presence of a polybasic (rrar) cleavage site at the junction of s1 and s2 subunits of the spike protein. the presence of a polybasic cleavage site helps in effective cleavage by furin and proteases and determines viral infectivity and host range (andersen et al. 2020) . interestingly, in case of the avian influenza virus, the gain of this polybasic site in ha that performs a similar function of host receptor binding like spike protein, can transform the virus from low virulent to high virulent forms. along with this, the acquisition of cleavage site is positively selected for fast replication and transmission rates (alexander and brown 2009). to better understand the transmission rates, the growth rate r 0 that defines the natural transmission of a pathogen needs to be calculated for sars, mers, and sars-cov-2. it is interesting to observe that although they belong to the same family, sars-cov-2 has twice the transmission rate when compared to sars. along with this, the multiplication cycles range is 5-10 days for sars and mers and 2-3 days for sars-cov-2 (liang 2020) . probably this the reason why sars and mers were far more contained, whereas covid-19 is highly widespread. the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 during the early outbreak in wuhan, china, was calculated as 1.4% . however, in late february, who estimated this rate to increase to 5.8%. on the other hand, south korea registered a death rate of 1% or less, while the death rate in italy seems to be, for now, several folds higher (rosenbaum 2020) . the infection has advanced to more than 210 countries and territories with an average mortality rate of 3.4% according to recent reports (rajgor et al. 2020) . therefore, therapeutic and vaccine initiatives in this direction are inevitable. efforts have been made in drug therapy as well as vaccine development to combat covid-19.till date, the us food and drug administration (fda) has approved an antiviral drug, remsdesivir, developed by gilead inc. usa, and an antimalarial drug, chloroquine (cq)/hydroxychloroquine (hcq), for the treatment of covid-19. an array of drugs approved for other diseases are also considered potentially useful while several investigational drugs are under study in several clinical trials conducted across the globe (table 1a and b; figure 1). in order to clinically manage coronavirus, researchers from china, france, and a team of doctors from rajasthan, india, have started using antiviral drugs in combination with chloroquine (colson et al. 2020; lai et al. 2020; . recently, who announced a global trial, called solidarity, to investigate whether this dangerous respiratory disease could be treated with the available therapeutic aids (https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/ 1059722). it is, however, an unprecedented effort that includes thousands of patients across many countries to volunteer for the clinical trials. the trials aim to test the effectiveness of the four potential candidates: (1) the antiviral drug remdesivir that is known to inhibit rna dependent rna polymerase, (2) a combination of two hiv drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, (3) lopinavir and ritonavir plus interferon beta, and (4) the antimalarial drugs chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (table 1b) . coronavirus being a rna virus, retroviral drugs could possibly have an effect on treatment; however, cq/ hcq, which was successful as an antimalarial, is currently being considered as a part of treatment strategy against covid-19 (colson et al. 2020 ). cq has also been shown to possess anti-hiv activity through posttranscriptional inhibition of gp120 present on the viral envelope or inhibition of tat-mediated transactivation (jiang et al. 1996; savarino et al. 2001 chloroquine can also increase the ph of endosomes (mauthe et al. 2018 ). since coronavirus do not encode for gp120 or tat protein and low ph is essential for uncoating of the virus inside the host cell, it is more likely that chloroquine stops viral spread by blocking the process of uncoating and release of nucleic acid. however, the current data from various small and nonrandomized trials show only limited effects of cq/ hcq or hcq-azithromycin combination on treatment for covid-19. since cq/hcq is known to cause toxic effects and unprescribed use has led to human deaths, large-scale randomized trials like the solidarity project will be able to convincingly prove the effectiveness of cq/hcq as a drug against covid-19.recently it has been shown that combination of lopinavir-ritonavir causes adverse effects on covid-19infected adults and no benefits are observed (cao et al. 2020 ). therefore, drugs should be used with caution until their mechanisms are well understood and their efficacy is well established. it is also known with viruses that mutate at high frequencies give rise to different strains, thereby easily gaining resistance to drugs. thus, in-depth analysis in animal models is required to study their mechanism of action and the ability of the virus to gain resistance against these drugs. further animal testing will also be important to measure absorbance of the drug in the body, its dissociation chemistry, its metabolomics and the mechanism of drug clearance. in principle, drugs only help in the treatment of humans once they contract the disease, but for long-term protection against the disease, vaccines have to be developed to avoid such a global pandemic. vaccines will be able to mount an immune response against the virus by generating neutralizing antibodies that would protect humans when again infected with sars-cov-2 and thus avoid another outbreak of such a virulent virus.the development of a vaccine against a disease is a combined effort from academicians and industries. under normal circumstances, the final product of the vaccine for use in humans takes at least 15-20 years passing through six phases of assessment (bregu et al. 2011) . in the first phase, the academician identifies a target that has the potential to be a vaccine candidate. thereafter, this candidate is challenged for its vaccine potential by testing it in animal models for the disease where the safety as well as immune responses to the antigen is analyzed. this identification and development of the vaccine candidate is a bottleneck and takes majority of the time (*9-10 years) required for vaccine development. once these steps are successful, only then is it taken to clinical trials in three phases where it is tested in humans for its safety in phase i and efficacy to protect against the disease in phases ii and iii, which take another 5-10 years (figure 2).different companies have already taken initiatives to develop a vaccine against covid-19. it is important to note that the studies on sars have provided important clues for vaccine against covid-19 and has also fasttracked the overall process of vaccine development. the vaccine initiatives by various companies against covid-19 is broadly based on three strategies: (i) using dna or rna, (ii) weakened virus known as vlps, and (iii) targeting viral proteins such as s protein (who 2020b). one of the important factors for an antigen to be considered as a vaccine candidate is its ability to mount a good immune response. however, in practicality one is always constrained in terms of the antigen that can be used as vaccine candidates. thus, to enhance immune responses, kim et al. developed a microneedle delivery method that induces an antigenspecific antibody response as early as week 2 after immunization. microneedle injection causes brief mechanical stress that induces the local innate immune response and thus avoids the use of adjuvant. also, the skin possesses a high amount of immune cells involved in innate immune response, so even injecting a small amount of antigen can lead to significant activation of innate immune responses against the antigen (kim et al. 2020) , making it an effective strategy when antigens are not too immunogenic.in order to establish an antigen as a vaccine candidate, animal models are of profound importance in various aspects of vaccinology, such as route and analyses of the mechanism, the transmission of the disease, duration of induced protection, the host immune response to infection and vaccination (griffin 2002) . thus, testing in animals is considered to be an important and critical parameter to proceed with the clinical trials in humans. one of the major problems associated with vaccine efforts against covid-19 is that the most of the animal disease models for sars-cov-2 are under testing and, in the absence of these models, it is difficult to predict the outcome of challenge studies in humans (gralinski and menachery 2020) . for an animal to be a model for a disease, the pathogen should be able to infect the animal using the same receptor on cells used in humans and then multiply inside the host successfully. additionally, it should provide either similar clinical symptoms as humans; sometimes mild symptoms also work as this would help in studying immune responses against the pathogen. in the following sections, we discuss various animal models that are being tested based on their pathogenesis after infection with sars-cov-2.as the key 12 amino acid residues present in ace2 of humans are conserved in ace2 of macaques as well (melin et al. 2020) , macaques are a closer model system to humans, and hence the choice for animal studies for vaccine testing of covid-19. the studies with macaques have shown that they do get infected with pulmonary infiltrates as observed in radiographs, with high viral loads in swabs of nose and throat and shedding in the upper and lower respiratory tract (munster et al. 2020; rockx et al. 2020) . taken together, the disease symptoms in rhesus macaques matches with the milder symptoms of sars-cov-2 infection in humans. further, serum analysis demonstrate an increase in chemokine levels of il1ra, il10, il15, mcp-1, il6 and decrease in tgfa levels on days 1 and 3 post-infection but with no statistical significance (munster et al. 2020 ). sars-cov-2 is known to affect older people as compared to young ones; similarly, it is also observed in macaques that older ones show higher viral loads in nose and throat along with prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of old animals (rockx et al. 2020) . thus, rhesus macaques can be a promising animal model for challenge studies and studying the efficacy of vaccines, as immune responses in monkeys are similar to humans. this will further allow us to understand how monkeys challenge coronavirus and protect themselves.ferrets are model organisms for influenza virus and have similar lung morphology as humans and can actually cough and sneeze, supporting their use as an animal model for sars-cov-2 (cameron et al. 2012; enkirch and von messling 2015) . a team of virologists led by ss vasan from australia has already shown that these animals are susceptible to coronavirus (callaway 2020), but the virus only causes an increase in body temperature and other symptoms that are the hallmark for sars-cov-2 do not develop and the virus cannot replicate to high levels. but, interestingly, the infected ferrets can spread the virus with high transmission rates even to adjacent cages through direct contact or aerosols (kim et al. 2020) . since most of the countries are now under community transmission stage, ferrets will act as a valuable animal model to study the transmission of the sars-cov-2.compared with the logistics, cost, and ethical regulations in using monkeys and ferrets, laboratory-bred mice always remain a convenient choice as a disease model. however, coronavirus do not infect mice and rats as 11 of the 29 amino acids in mice and 13 of 29 amino acids in rats differ in the binding region of ace2 compared to humans (chan et al. 2020) . in order to solve this problem, perlman laboratory developed humanized mouse models for sars where they incorporated human ace2 in mice (mccray et al. 2007 ). the humanized ace2 mice are successfully infected by sars and develop lethal brain disease, making it an obvious choice to test infection with sars-cov-2 as well. however, due to lack of funding and high cost of maintenance of this mice colony, they discontinued breeding of mice in their facility and submitted the sperms of hace2 mice to jackson laboratory. but these mice are now high in demand and jackson laboratory is facing a huge pressure to meet these demands. however, recent results from china have shown that hace2 mice do support sars-cov-2 infection where they reduce weight by 20% and virus replication occur in lungs. moreover, infected hace2 mice also suffer from interstitial pneumonia where bronchioles are filled with periodic acid schiff (pas), positive exudation or detached bronchial epithelium, but are unable to transmit the disease. also, the infiltrates are enriched in macrophages, t-lymphocytes, and b-lymphocytes. the authors also confirmed that the mice use hace2 for entry and fulfill koch's postulates, indicating that these mice are successful disease model for sars-cov-2 (bao et al. 2020) .these animals support sars infection and show maximum similarity to human ace2, where only 4 amino acids out of 29 are different in the critical binding region of ace2, making them a testable model for sars-cov-2 infection. upon infection of sars-cov-2, syrian hamsters demonstrate weight loss by *11% along with high viral load in nasal turbinate, lungs, and trachea. further, the lethality rate in hamsters is 5% and exudative inflammation with hemorrhage and necrosis of alveolae damage is visible during the initial infection period. the inflammation of intestinal mucosal epithelium that is the causative agent of diarrohea along with myocardial degeneration is consistent with the pathogenesis observed in humans. importantly, syrian hamsters show similar immune responses as that of humans where ifn-c and pro-inflammatory cytokines are induced at day 2 post-infection followed by the decrease of type ii interferon and il6 and increase of tgf-b at day 7 post-infection. for an animal to be successful as a model system and perform challenge studies, is also dependent on its ability to transmit the pathogen. consistent with this, syrian hamsters are able to transmit the disease to naïve hamsters upon challenge with sars-cov-2 (chan et al. 2020) . taken all the data together, as syrian hamsters show pathogenesis, immune responses similar to humans, and are capable of transmission, this strengthens their use as one of the most testable models for vaccine studies.thus, there are many promising animal models for testing the vaccine candidates for sars-cov-2, but still extensive studies are required to confirm their efficiency as an appropriate model for covid-19. in order to fight coronavirus infection and win the race against time, moderna, a biotechnological company in collaboration with national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid), usa, has already begun phase i clinical trial with experimental vaccine mrna-1273 ('rna vaccine testing begins' 2020, who 2020b). their argument for directly going for phase i clinical trial is that the mrna-1273 raised a good antibody response after immunization in mice and a lack of disease model for coronavirus. cansino biologics from china has also developed a replication-defective adenovirus expressing spike protein of sars-cov-2 as a vaccine candidate for covid-19 (who 2020b). beijing institute of biological products/wuhan institute of biological products and sinovac are using inactivated method while inovio pharmaceuticals is using a dna-based vaccine approach. similarly, in order to fast-track vaccine development, all of them have skipped animal trials and are currently performing phase i trials. the phase i clinical trials will test the safety and toxicity of their vaccine target in humans and in a way help in protecting humans from sars-cov-2. although this looks promising for fast-tracking vaccine development, there is division among the scientific community about bypassing animal models before phase i clinical trials. in addition, agencies like peta are against using animals for research purposes. the question remains: can vaccine research do without an animal model?in the history of mankind, it has been clear that viral pandemics have been common in affecting millions of people. the problem is due to its ability to multiply inside the host and produce high numbers by infecting a single cell accompanied by its stability in non-living surfaces which allows them to spread very fast. that is why virus pandemics are global with high transmission rates. thus, to control viruses, extreme steps are often needed. therefore, in the absence of disease model, backed by their antibody responses in mice, niaid and cansino biologics moved ahead with phase i clinical trials. after bypassing animal model studies for vaccines, different biotechnological companies are looking forward to come up with a vaccine in around a year to a year and a half.thus, the decision by the fda to bypass animal trials is taken positively by entrepreneurs. according to them, flexibility of laws by the fda could avoid delays in treating, as observed in the case of ganciclovir. although ganciclovir is successful in treating patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related cytomegalovirus retinitis, due to lack of animal studies, it did not get approval by fda and was delayed by 4 years (van norman 2019).besides overcoming the time frame in which a vaccine can enter the market, it is also important to note that results from animal studies may not translate to humans both in terms of toxicity and challenge studies. isuprel, a treatment for asthma, was rendered safe in rats, guinea pigs, dogs, and monkeys, but still led to deaths in humans with far less dosages in great britain. in another instance, to treat human autoimmune disease, a monoclonal antibody tgn1412, after going through animal models, was processed for phase i trials. the introduction of tgn1412 led to critical illness within minutes along with long-term complications in phase i volunteers (van norman 2019). however, tgn1412 is now restored for rheumatoid arthritis after developing better assays for studying immune responses and lowering the dosage of this monoclonal antibody (brown 2018) , further strengthening the fact that studies with animals may not always translate to use in humans.in contrast, chemicals that are generally toxic in animal studies may be safe in humans. penicillin, fatal to guinea pigs, would have failed animal studies but due to lack of regulations to perform animal studies at that time, it came into use and is presently a successful drug. similarly, aspirin is toxic to rhesus monkeys and paracetamol is toxic to dogs and cats (van norman 2019).thus, these studies indicate that animal studies do not predict the outcomes to humans although they share a lot of genomic similarities; the final response to disease will also depend on the epigenome and environmental differences. even with the transgenic humanized models that mimic the human system, we must remember that often genes do not work alone in such complex higher-order organisms.although bypassing animal models can save time, effort, and money, but, it is not possible to perform safety and challenge studies for a disease in humans. also, animal studies provide the foundation to study disease. further, it is difficult to study the progression of disease in humans but it is easy in an animal model as they can be sacrificed for histopathology in order to follow the course of infection. although cell lines can also be used to study the infection process, animal models provide the advantage of studying the viral multiplication with respect to symptoms and physiology of an organism. thus, it becomes really important for a newly originated coronavirus to be studied in an animal model. further, studying animal models will also provide detailed information about the potential reservoirs of sars-cov-2 in an organism.another problem faced by vaccine efforts against viral diseases, especially viruses having rna as the genetic material, is that repair mechanisms do not work on rna and thus lot of mutations are accumulated in their rna. this phenomenon is known as antigenic drift and is the reason that influenza shots are needed before every seasonal flu infection. thus, sars-cov-2-possessing rna genome is also prone to antigenic drift. hence, animal models of coronavirus will help in understanding the selection pressure and antigenic drift and evolution of the virus once a vaccine is administered.one of the major disadvantages of bypassing animal models is that it has been observed in case of viral infections that sometimes the administration of vaccines enhances the susceptibility of the subject to the disease. this phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent enhancement or antigen sin and is common for vaccine candidates of hiv/aids virus and dengue virus. once the subject is immunized with the antigen, it mounts an immune response against the antigen. but, when the vaccinated individual is infected again with the virus having a different serotype, the pre-existing antibodies are not able to neutralize the virus. the formation of antibody-virus complex helps in attachment to fcc receptor on circulating monocytes, resulting in the efficient infection of monocytes by the virus (halstead 2002) . thus, instead of protecting the subject, it leads to higher complications and death of the subject in case of infection by the pathogen (huisman et al. 2009 ). therefore, the biotech companies that have bypassed animal models should note that antibody-dependent enhancement is also observed with feline coronavirus (fcov). the immunization of mice with spike (s) protein of this virus mounts an overall high antibody response but neutralizing antibody levels are low. however, challenge of these cats results in enhanced susceptibility to infection along with death of cats (huisman et al. 2009 ). this phenomenon is especially relevant to proteins that are prone to antigenic drift such as the s protein and sars and mers, known to be capable of this phenomena (liu et al. 2019; houser et al. 2017) . as s protein is the major vaccine target of sars-cov-2, studies in animal model are really required before establishing it as a vaccine candidate.in this global emergency, the entire scientific community is attempting effective treatment and prevention of the disease. to shorten the time and for the larger interest of humanity, some routine yet essetial processes like animal trials are bypassed in the process of development of vaccine and drug development. while options like drug repurposing are already adapted, with varying degrees of success, effective and targeted drugs and vaccines for the sars-cov-2 infection are still awaited. moreover, agencies like who and fda have already given a green signal for clinical trials of vaccines bypassing the regular process of animal trials. hence, it is important to access the positive and negative effects of the same. choosing a suitable animal model is one of the main concerns for animal testing as the animal should mimic the response and effects to be generated after introduction of the drug/vaccine to humans. importantly, some animal models such as the rhesus macaque, ferrets, mice, and syrian hamster are proving to be successful for challenge by the sars-cov-2 with one or other similar symptoms as humans. however, a successful animal trial is not the only indicator of the success of any drug/vaccine due to physiological barriers; hence, the decision of bypassing the animal model needs to be taken with utmost caution. further, saving time should not cost a large number of human lives as a failure of the drug/vaccine could have devastating consequences.however, covid-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at 2019-ncov receptor-binding motif (particularly gln493) which provide advantageous interactions with human ace2 [15] . this difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses.at present, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but chinese traditional medicine, such shufengjiedu capsules and lianhuaqingwen capsule, could be possible treatments for covid-19. however, there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy for these drugs [22] .the main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself. although traditional vaccines, which depend on biochemical trials, induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized animals but they can be costly, allergenic, time consuming and require in vitro culture of pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety [23, 24]. thus the need for safe and efficacious vaccines is highly recommended.peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe, and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses [25, 26] . the core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized b-cell and t-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. b-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked with a t-cell epitope to make it immunogenic. the t-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids), whereas the b-cell epitopes can be proteins [27, 28] . therefore, in this study, we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict epitopes from corona envelope (e) protein using immunoinformatics analysis [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . while rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection.workflow summarizing the procedures for the epitope-based peptide vaccine prediction is shown in fig. 1 figure 1: descriptive workflow for the epitope-based peptide vaccine prediction.full genebank files of the complete

(https://www.megasoftware.net).iedb tools were used to predict the conserved sequences (10-mersequence) from hla class i and class ii t-cell epitopes by using artificial neural network (ann) approach [40] [41] [42] . artificial neural network (ann) version 2.2 was chosen as prediction method as it depends on the median inhibitory concentration (ic50) [40, [43] [44] [45] . for the binding analysis, all the alleles were carefully chosen, and the length was set at 10 before prediction was done. analysis of epitopes binding to mhc class i and ii molecules was assessed by the iedb mhc prediction server at (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/) and (http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/), respectively. all conserved immunodominant peptides binding to mhc i and ii molecules at score equal or less than 100 median inhibitory concentrations (ic50) and 1000, respectively were selected for further analysis while epitopes with ic50 greater than 100 were eliminated [46] .population coverage for each epitope was carefully determined by the iedb population coverage calculation tool. due to the diverse binding sites of epitopes with different hla allele, the most promising epitope candidates were calculated for population coverage against the whole world, china and europe population to get and ensure a universal vaccine [47, 48] . (http://tools.iedb.org/population/)the reference sequence of e protein that has been retrieved from gene bank was used as an input in raptorx to predict the 3d structure of e protein [49, 50] , the visualization of the obtained 3d protein structure was performed in ucsf chimera (version1.8) [51] .in silico molecular docking:in order to estimate the binding affinities between the epitopes and molecular structure of mhc i and mhc ii, in silico molecular docking were used. sequences of proposed epitopes were selected from covid-19 reference sequence using ucsf chimera 1.10 and saved as a pdb file.the obtained files were then optimized and energy minimized. the hla-a*02:01 was selected as the macromolecule for docking. its crystal structure (4uq3) was downloaded from the rcsb protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do), which was in a complex with an azobenzene-containing peptide [52] .all water molecules and heteroatoms in the retrieved target file 4uq3 were then removed.target structure was further optimized and energy minimized using swiss pdb viewer v.4.1.0 software [53] .molecular docking was performed using autodock 4.0 software, based on lamarckian genetic algorithm;

alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccines design [60] . peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for b and t cells [61] .applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands [62] [63] [64] . this approach has been used frequently in saint louis encephalitis virus [65] , dengue virus [66] , chikungunya virus [67] proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines.the covid-19 is an rna virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the dna viruses [68] . these mutations lied on the surface of the protein, which make covid-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot [69] .in our present work, different peptides were proposed for the designing of vaccine against covid-19 (fig. 1) . in the beginning, the whole genome of covid-19 was analyzed by comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [70] . artemis comparative tool (act) was used to analyze human coronavirus (hcov-hku1) reference sequence vs. wuhan-hu-1 covid-19. results obtained (fig.2) revealed extensive mutation among the tested genomes. new genes; orf8 and orf6; were found inserted in covid-19 which were absent in hcov-hku1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [71] . high rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp to the end of the sequence. this region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are envelope (e) protein, nucleocapsid (n) protein, membrane (m) protein, and spike (s) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [72, 73] .these conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment between mers-cov and bat-coronavirus [74] and analyzed in sars-cov [75] .the four proteins were then analyzed by vaxigen software to test the probability of antigenic proteins. protein e was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as shown in table 1 . literature survey confirmed this result in which protein e was investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003 and, more recently, middle-east respiratory 1 8 syndrome (mers) [72] . furthermore, the conservation of this protein against the seven strains was tested and confirmed through the use of bioedit package tool (fig. 3) .as phylogenetic analysis is very powerful tool for determining the evolutionary relationship between strains. multiple sequence alignment (msa) was performed using clustalw for the seven strains of coronavirus, which are covid-19(nc_04551), sars-cov (fj211859), mesa-cov (nc_019843), hcov-hku1 (ay884001), hcov-oc43 (kf923903), hcov-nl63 (nc_005831) and hcov-229e (ky983587). the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree revealed that covid-19 is found in the same clade of sars-cov, thus the two strains are highly related to each other (fig. 4) .the immune response of t cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to b cell, where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [76] . vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen. moreover the cd8+ t and cd4+ t cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity [77] . thus designing vaccine against t cell is much more important.choosing protein e as the antigenic site, the binding affinity to mhc molecules was then evaluated. the protein reference sequence was submitted to iedb mhc predication tool. 21 peptides were found to bind mhc class i with different affinities (table 1) , from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage ( table 2 ; fig. 5 ).analysis in iedb mhc ii binding prediction tool resulted in prediction of 61 peptides (table 2) , from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage (table 3 the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.934232 doi: biorxiv preprint groove with mhc residues with least binding energy -13.2 kcal/mol, -11 kcal/mol and -11.3 kcal/mol, respectively (fig.6c, d and e) .although both flu and anti-hiv drugs are used currently in china for treatment of covid-19, and chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, has recently found to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against 79] ; nevertheless more studies are required to standardize these therapies. in addition, there has been some success in the development of mouse models of mers-cov and sars-cov infection, and candidate vaccines where the envelope (e) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . to best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in envelope (e) protein as candidates for covid-19. accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitopes vaccine candidate against t cell.extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered in covid-19 strain using the comparative sequencing. in addition, a number of mhc class i and ii related peptides were found promising candidates. among which the peptides yvysrvknl, slvkpsfyv and lailtalrl show high potentiality for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage. t cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for covid-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically ensuring its safety and immunogenic profile to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.the authors acknowledge the deanship of scientific research at university of bahri for the supportive cooperation.all data underlying the results are available as part of the article, and no additional source data are required. the copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.934232 doi: biorxiv preprintcoronaviruses (cov) are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as middle east respiratory syndrome (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov). in the last decades, six strains of coronaviruses were identified, however in december 2019; a new strain has been spread across wuhan city, china [1, 2] . it was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) by the world health organization (who) [3] . in late january 2020, who declared the outbreak a global pandemic with cases in more than 45 covid-19 is a positive-sense single stranded rna virus (+ssrna). its rna sequence is approximately 30,000 bases in length [4] . it belongs to the subgenus sarbecovirus, genusbetacoronavirus within the family coronaviridae. the corona envelope (e) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus' life cycle, such as pathogenesis, envelope formation, assembly and budding; alongside with its interactions with both other covs proteins (m, n & s) and host cell proteins (release of infectious particles after budding) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .the infected person characterized with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels or combination of all these within 3-6 days after exposure. further molecular diagnosis can be made by real time-pcr for genes encoding the internal rnadependent rna polymerase and spike's receptor binding domain, which can be confirmed by sanger sequencing and full genome analysis by ngs, multiplex nucleic acid amplification and microarray-based assays [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] a phylogenetic tree of the mutation history of a family of viruses is possible to reconstruct with a sufficient number of sequenced genomes. the phylogenetic analysis indicates that covid-19 is likely originated from bats [15] . it also showed that is highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a common ancestor [16] .the sequence of covid-19 rbd, together with its rbm that contacts receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ace2), was found similar to that of sars coronavirus. on january 2020, a group of scientists demonstrated that ace2 could act as the receptor for covid-19 [17-21].however, covid-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at 2019-ncov receptor-binding motif (particularly gln493) which provide advantageous interactions with human ace2 [15] . this difference in affinity possibly explains why the novel coronavirus is more contagious than those other viruses.at present, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for humans, but chinese traditional medicine, such shufengjiedu capsules and lianhuaqingwen capsule, could be possible treatments for covid-19. however, there are no clinical trials approving the safety and efficacy for these drugs [22] .the main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself. although traditional vaccines, which depend on biochemical trials, induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized animals but they can be costly, allergenic, time consuming and require in vitro culture of pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety [23, 24]. thus the need for safe and efficacious vaccines is highly recommended.peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe, and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses [25, 26] . the core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized b-cell and t-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. b-cell epitope of a target molecule can be linked with a t-cell epitope to make it immunogenic. the t-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids), whereas the b-cell epitopes can be proteins [27, 28] . therefore, in this study, we aimed to design a peptide-based vaccine to predict epitopes from corona envelope (e) protein using immunoinformatics analysis [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . while rapid further studies are recommended to prove the efficiency of the predicted epitopes as a peptide vaccine against this emerging infection.workflow summarizing the procedures for the epitope-based peptide vaccine prediction is shown in act is an in silico analysis software for visualization of comparisons between complete genome sequences and associated annotations [35] . it is also applied to identify regions of similarity, rearrangements and insertions at any level from base-pair differences to the whole genome.

(https://www.megasoftware.net).iedb tools were used to predict the conserved sequences (10-mersequence) from hla class i and class ii t-cell epitopes by using artificial neural network (ann) approach [40] [41] [42] . artificial neural network (ann) version 2.2 was chosen as prediction method as it depends on the median inhibitory concentration (ic50) [40, [43] [44] [45] . for the binding analysis, all the alleles were carefully chosen, and the length was set at 10 before prediction was done. analysis of epitopes binding to mhc class i and ii molecules was assessed by the iedb mhc prediction server at (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/) and (http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/), respectively. all conserved immunodominant peptides binding to mhc i and ii molecules at score equal or less than 100 median inhibitory concentrations (ic50) and 1000, respectively were selected for further analysis while epitopes with ic50 greater than 100 were eliminated [46] .population coverage for each epitope was carefully determined by the iedb population coverage calculation tool. due to the diverse binding sites of epitopes with different hla allele, the most promising epitope candidates were calculated for population coverage against the whole world, china and europe population to get and ensure a universal vaccine [47, 48] . (http://tools.iedb.org/population/)the reference sequence of e protein that has been retrieved from gene bank was used as an input in raptorx to predict the 3d structure of e protein [49, 50] , the visualization of the obtained 3d protein structure was performed in ucsf chimera (version1.8) [51] .in order to estimate the binding affinities between the epitopes and molecular structure of mhc i and mhc ii, in silico molecular docking were used. sequences of proposed epitopes were selected from covid-19 reference sequence using ucsf chimera 1.10 and saved as a pdb file.the obtained files were then optimized and energy minimized. the hla-a*02:01 was selected as the macromolecule for docking. its crystal structure (4uq3) was downloaded from the rcsb protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do), which was in a complex with an azobenzene-containing peptide [52] .all water molecules and heteroatoms in the retrieved target file 4uq3 were then removed.target structure was further optimized and energy minimized using swiss pdb viewer v.4.1.0 software [53] .molecular docking was performed using autodock 4.0 software, based on lamarckian genetic algorithm; which combines energy evaluation through grids of affinity potential to find the suitable binding position for a ligand on a given protein [54, 55] polar hydrogen atoms were added to the protein targets and kollman united atomic charges were computed. the target's grid map was calculated and set to 60×60×60 points with grid spacing of 0.375 ǻ . the grid box was then allocated properly in the target to include the active residue in the center. the genetic algorithm and its run were set to 100.the docking algorithms were set to default. finally, results were retrieved as binding energies and poses that showed lowest binding energies were visualized using ucsf chimera.the reference sequence of envelope protein was aligned with hcov-hku1 reference protein using artemis comparison tool as illustrated in (fig. 2 ). figure 2 : artemis analysis of envelope protein displaying 3 windows, the upper window represents hcov-hku1 reference sequence and its genes are highlighted in blue starting from orflab gene and ending with n gene. the middle window describes the similarities and the difference between the two genomes. red lines indicate match between genes from the two genomes blue lines indicates inversion which represents same sequences in the two genomes but they are organized in the opposite direction, and the lower windows represents covid-19and its genes started from arflab and ends with n genes.the mutated proteins were tested for antigenicity using vaxijen software, where the envelope protein found as the best immunogenic target in table 1 . sequence alignment of covid-19envelope protein was done using bioedit software which shows total conservation across four sequences which were retrieved from china and usa ( to study the evolutionary relationship between all the seven strains of coronavirus, a multiple sequence alignment (msa) was performed using clustalw by mega software. this alignment was used to construct maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree as seen in fig. 4 . iedb website was used to analyze 2019-ncov envelope protein for t cell related peptides. results show ten mhc class i and ii associated peptides with high population coverage (tables  2 and 3 ; fig. 5 ). the most promising peptides were visualized using ucsf chimera software ( fig.6a and b) . designing of a novel vaccine is very crucial to defending the rapid endless of global burden of disease [56] [57] [58] [59] . in the last few decades, biotechnology has advanced rapidly; alongside with the understanding of immunology which assisted the rise of new approaches towards rational vaccines design [60] . peptide-based vaccines are designed to elicit immunity particular pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen specific for b and t cells [61] .applying the advanced bioinformatics tools and databases, various peptide-based vaccines could be designed where the peptides act as ligands [62] [63] [64] . this approach has been used frequently in saint louis encephalitis virus [65] , dengue virus [66] , chikungunya virus [67] proposing promising peptides for designing vaccines.the covid-19 is an rna virus which tends to mutate more commonly than the dna viruses [68] . these mutations lied on the surface of the protein, which make covid-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot [69] .in our present work, different peptides were proposed for the designing of vaccine against covid-19 (fig. 1) . in the beginning, the whole genome of covid-19 was analyzed by comparative genomic approach to determine the potential antigenic target [70] . artemiscomparative tool (act) was used to analyze human coronavirus (hcov-hku1) reference sequence vs. wuhan-hu-1 covid-19. results obtained (fig.2) revealed extensive mutation among the tested genomes. new genes; orf8 and orf6; were found inserted in covid-19 which were absent in hcov-hku1 that might be acquired by the horizontal gene transmission [71] . high rate of mutation between the two genomes were observed in the region from 20000 bp to the end of the sequence. this region encodes the four major structural proteins in coronavirus which are envelope (e) protein, nucleocapsid (n) protein, membrane (m) protein, and spike (s) protein, all of which are required to produce a structurally complete virus [72, 73] .these conserved antigenic sites were revealed in previous studies through sequence alignment between mers-cov and bat-coronavirus [74] and analyzed in sars-cov [75] .the four proteins were then analyzed by vaxigen software to test the probability of antigenic proteins. protein e was found to be the most antigenic gene with the highest probability as shown in table 1 . literature survey confirmed this result in which protein e was investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003 and, more recently, middle-east respiratory syndrome (mers) [72] . furthermore, the conservation of this protein against the seven strains was tested and confirmed through the use of bioedit package tool (fig. 3) .as highly related to each other (fig. 4) .the immune response of t cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to b cell,where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [76] . vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen. moreover the cd8+ t and cd4+ t cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity [77] . thus designing vaccine against t cell is much more important.choosing protein e as the antigenic site, the binding affinity to mhc molecules was then evaluated. the protein reference sequence was submitted to iedb mhc predication tool. 21peptides were found to bind mhc class i with different affinities (table 1) , from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage ( table 2 ; fig. 5 ).analysis in iedb mhc ii binding prediction tool resulted in prediction of 61 peptides (table 2) , from which ten peptides were selected for vaccine design based on the number of alleles and world population percentage ( where the envelope (e) protein is mutated or deleted have been described [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . to best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify certain peptides in envelope (e) protein as candidates for covid-19. accordingly, these epitopes were strongly recommended as promising epitopes vaccine candidate against t cell.extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered in covid-19 strain using the comparative sequencing. in addition, a number of mhc class i and ii related peptides were found promising candidates. among which the peptides yvysrvknl, slvkpsfyv and lailtalrl show high potentiality for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage. t cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for covid-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically ensuring its safety and immunogenic profile to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.the authors acknowledge the deanship of scientific research at university of bahri for the supportive cooperation.all data underlying the results are available as part of the article, and no additional source data are required. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) belongs to the genus betacoronavirus of the coronaviridae family and is identified as the pathogen of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) [1] . the epicenter of the covid-19 coronavirus outbreak was the central chinese city of wuhan, from where it spread globally. on 30 th january 2020, the world health organization officially declared the covid-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. human to human transmission occurs through droplets, contact, and fomites. people with covid-19 show symptoms of fever, cough, muscle aches, headache, and diarrhea. the principal feature of the severe disease is acute onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates.the virus genome has been sequenced that allowed the development of diagnostic tests and research into vaccines and therapeutics [1, 2] . a specific rt-pcr-based test has been developed that is in use for clinical diagnoses [3] . the abundance of publications in the first three months of 2020 indicates the intensive scientific effort to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes for treating covid-19 [4] . more than 200 clinical trials are currently underway to test novel and repurposed compounds against sars-cov-2 [5, 6] . certain drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and remdesivir, are being tested in clinical trials [7] [8] [9] . one small study reported that combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin reduced the detection of viral rna compared to control [10, 11] . a recent openlabel trial with two protease inhibitors, lopinavir, and ritonavir, failed [12] . several inactivated vaccines, viral vectored vaccines (adenovirus vector, ankara vector), nanoparticle-based vaccines, fusion-protein based vaccines, adjuvanted vaccines, recombinant protein, and dna vaccines, as well as live-attenuated vaccines, are also being developed and tested, but these vaccines are many months away from the market [13] [14] [15] [16] . a phase 1 clinical trial of moderna's mrna-based sars-cov-2 candidate vaccine, mrna-1273, has started on march 16, 2020 [17] [18] [19] . however, this is the first of several steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefits of the vaccine.the sars-cov-2 consists of single, positive-stranded rna and four structural proteins: a spike glycoprotein (s), a membrane glycoprotein (m), an envelope protein (e), and a nucleocapsid protein (n) [20] . to enter the host cells, the virus uses a densely glycosylated spike protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor with high affinity 4 [21, 22] . structural and biochemical studies suggest that the rbd has an ultra-high binding affinity to the human ace2 receptor [23] . few groups have designed subunit vaccines against sars-cov-2; however, their workflow involved either use of single protein for vaccine design [24, 25] or used only ctl epitopes without considering the importance of b-cell or htl epitopes [26] . some subunit-vaccines are also in preclinical trials [27, 28] . here, we focused on designing a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine against sars-cov-2 using 33 highly antigenic epitopes. we believe that experimental evaluation may result in a novel and immunogenic vaccine that may confer protection against sars-cov-2 infection.the protein sequences of sars-cov-2 were retrieved from the ncbi database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/mn996531.1/) for subunit vaccine development (table   1 ) [29] . each of these proteins was screened for their average antigenic propensity using the antigenic peptides prediction tool (http://imed.med.ucm.es/tools/antigenic.pl). proteins with an antigenic probability score of greater than 0.8 were considered for vaccine construction.the helper t-lymphocyte (htl) epitopes for the selected sars-cov-2 proteins were predicted using the mhc-ii epitope prediction tool from the immune epitope database (iedb, http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/). selected epitopes had the lowest percentile rank and ic 50 values.additionally, these epitopes were checked by the ifn epitope server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ifnepitope/) for the capability to induce th1 type immune response accompanied by ifn-ϒ production. cytotoxic t-lymphocyte (ctl) epitopes for the screened proteins were predicted using the netctl1.2 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netctl/). b-cell epitopes for the screened sars-cov-2 proteins were predicted using the abcpred server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/abcpred/). the prediction of the toxic/non-toxic nature of all the selected htl, ctl, and b-cell epitopes was checked using the toxinpred module (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/multi_submit.php).the vaccine subunit was designed by adding an adjuvant, htl, ctl, and b-cell epitopes connected by specific linkers to provide adequate separation of epitopes in vivo. eaaak linker was used to join the adjuvant and htl. intra htl, intra ctl, and b-cell epitopes were joined using gpgpg, aay, and kk, respectively. to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine construct, the tlr-3 agonist, human β-defensin 1 (uniprot id: p60022), was used as the adjuvant.the immunogenicity of the vaccine was determined using the vaxijen server (http://www.ddgpharmfac.net/vaxijen/vaxijen/vaxijen.html) and antigenpro module of scratch protein predictor (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/). the allergenicity of the vaccine was checked using allertop v2.0 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/allertop/) and algpred server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/algpred/).the physiochemical characteristics of the vaccine were determined using the protparam tool of the expasy database server (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/).the secondary structure of the subunit vaccine construct was predicted using psipred 4.0 protein sequence analysis workbench (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/), while the tertiary structure was predicted by de novo structure prediction-based trrosetta modeling suite. trrosetta uses a deep residual neural network to predict the inter-residue distance and orientation distributions of the input sequence. then it converts predicted distance and orientation distributions into smooth restraints to build 3d structure models-based on direct energy minimization. the model of the vaccine construct with the best tm-score was validated by prochek v.3.5 structures were saved at every 10 ps for structural and dynamic analysis.the analysis from md simulation was performed as described earlier [30] . briefly, the backbone java codon adaptation tool (jcat) (http://www.jcat.de/) was used for codon optimization of the vaccine sequence to test high-level expression of the vaccine in e. coli strain k12. nebcutter (http://nc2.neb.com/nebcutter2/) was used for the selection of restriction enzyme cleavage sites, and the expression vector pet28a(+) was selected. in silico clone of the vaccine was designed using the snapgene 1.1.3 restriction cloning tool.the amino acid sequence of the three sars-cov-2 proteins, namely, nucleocapsid protein, membrane glycoprotein, and surface spike glycoprotein, were retrieved from the ncbi database (table 1) . these proteins are known to have a prominent role in host receptor recognition, viral entry, and pathogenicity. the proteins with an antigenic score of greater than 0.8 (table 1) were used further for the prediction of epitopes for subunit vaccine designing. a schematic representation of the methodology for the construction of the subunit vaccine candidate is shown in figure 1 .helper t-lymphocytes are the key players of the adaptive immune response. they are involved in the activation of b-cells and cytotoxic t cells for antibody production and killing infected target cells, respectively. all three proteins were subjected to the iedb mhc-ii epitope prediction module for htl prediction. a total of six highest immunogenic epitopes of 15-mer 8 were selected based on their percentile rank and ic 50 values. also, all these epitopes showed positive scores on ifnepitope server output (table 2) . b-cells are the main components of humoral immunity during the adaptive immune response that produces antibodies, which recognize antigens. therefore, it was necessary to predict b-cell epitopes before vaccine designing. abcpred was performed for predicting b-cell epitope, and a total of 9 epitopes with top scores from the three proteins were considered for the vaccine (table 3) .ctl epitopes are essential for inducing mhc-i cellular immune response by neutralizing virus-infected cells and damaged cells via releasing cytotoxic proteins like granzymes, perforins, etc. the ctl epitopes were predicted for all selected proteins using the netctl 1.2 server.here, a2, a3, and b7 supertypes were considered for prediction as they cover at least 88.3% of the total ethnic population. eighteen epitopes with a combined score of >0.75 were finally considered for the vaccine (table 4 ). all the selected htl, ctl, and b-cell epitopes were subjected to the toxinpred module to screen for their toxicity. supplementary table 1 shows that all epitopes chosen for the vaccine were non-toxic.a total of 6 htls, 18 ctls, and 9 b-cell epitopes derived from the three proteins were used to design the subunit vaccine (566 amino acid residues) against sars-cov-2 (supplementary figure 1) . the human β-defensin 1(68 amino acid residues) sequence was added as an adjuvant followed by the htl, ctl, and b-cell epitopes and linked by specific linkers.an important parameter of vaccine designing is ensuring that the constructed vaccine is immunogenic to induce a humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response against the targeted virus. the computational data suggest that our vaccine is antigenic with a probability score of 0.513 and 0.732 predicted by vaxijen v2.0 and antigenpro servers, respectively. the allergenicity score was found to be −0.658 in algpred prediction module. additionally, the vaccine was also found to be non-allergic using allertop v2.0. respectively, suggesting that the vaccine is thermostable and hydrophilic, respectively.the secondary structure was predicted using the psipred 4.0 server (supplementary figure 2) .the tertiary structure of the vaccine was predicted using the trrosetta modeling suite. the 3d model generated by trrosetta modeling was subjected to the procheck server, whereramachandran plot statistics were generated. the output showed 98.4% residues were present in the favored region, 1.0% residues in the generously allowed region, and 0.6% residues in disallowed regions. further, the z-score plot and energy plot was generated by the prosa web server. the calculated z-score (−8.46) lies within the x-ray crystal structure range. the energy plot suggested that all the residues have low energy value in the modeled structure ( figure 2 ).vaccine-receptor docking was performed to evaluate the binding energy of the vaccine with its tlr-3 receptor. cluspro analysis provided 30 vaccine-receptor complexes with respective energy scores. the lowest energy complex with a binding energy of about −1491 kj.mol -1 was selected and subjected to md simulation ( figure 3 ).the binding modes, dynamics, and stability of the vaccine-tlr3 complex were evaluated using a 40 ns md simulation study (figure 4) . the atomic-level interaction between vaccine and tlr3 was determined, and root mean square deviation (rmsd), root mean square fluctuation (rmsf), radius of gyration (rg), hydrogen bond, and contact energy were calculated.the rmsd data suggests that the receptor-vaccine complex was stabilized after about 20ns until the end of the simulation ( figure 4a ). all the calculations were then done for the 20-40 ns md simulation trajectory. next, rmsf calculation, which gives information about the residue wise dynamics of a protein with respect to its initial position, was done. an average rmsf value of 0.39 nm was observed for the complex ( figure 4b ). our subsequent analysis of the changes in the rg for the vaccine-tlr3 complex during the simulation was also determined, and the average rg was found to be 1.47 nm, demonstrating the compactness of the tlr3 receptor with vaccine subunit during the simulations ( figure 4c ). we further analyzed the hydrogen bonds that typically, the largest associated eigenvalues define the essential subspace in which most of the protein dynamics occur. for this, the clusters of stable states of pca for the tlr3-vaccine complex were visualized and analyzed. the trace value calculated from the covariance matrix of the tlr3-vaccine was found to be 2.18 nm 2 , suggesting that the complex exhibited compact behavior during the simulation (supplementary figure 3) . lastly, the detailed interactions between tlr3 and the vaccine protein were computed from the starting structure of md simulations and the stabilized structure of the complex extracted from md simulated trajectory ( figure 5 and table 5 ). the higher total number of interactions in the stabilized complex suggests the stability and tighter binding of the vaccine with tlr3.the codon optimization index ensures the relationship between codon usage and gene expression in a heterologous system. the jcat output was further analyzed in nebcutter, and at the n-and 11 c-terminal ends of the optimized vaccine sequence, bamhi and ndei restriction sites were added that are non-cutters for the vaccine construct but are present in the multiple cloning site of the selected expression vector pet28a(+). in silico clone was generated using the snapgene 1.1.3 restriction cloning tool that resulted in a cloned product of 7034 bp ( figure 6 ).some reports suggest that 5 to 10% of recovered patients in wuhan test positive again; this indicates a possibility of a resurgence of covid-19 in places where lockdowns have already worked. as a consequence, the spread can also be caused by asymptomatic carriers [31] [32] [33] . a positive re-test, however, may also be because the original test was false-negative, and the patient was not actually covid-negative. whatever may be the case, a vaccine is a better option for coronavirus management than drugs.the efforts to produce a vaccine against coronavirus are moving at a rapid pace. two candidate vaccines are in phase i clinical trials: i) an adenovirus type-5 vector-based vaccine, and ii) an lnp-encapsulated mrna vaccine. studies evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines are underway. additionally, several vaccine candidates are under preclinical evaluation [34] . though these trials are underway, there are known situations that vaccines have failed.recently few groups have tried designing subunit vaccines against sars-cov-2; however, their workflow involved either use of single protein for vaccine design [24, 25] or used only ctl epitopes without considering the importance of b-cell or htl epitopes [35] . we considered all of these points while designing the vaccine. based on extensive bioinformatics analysis, we used three proteins to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against novel coronavirus sars-cov-2.these proteins are nucleocapsid protein (n), membrane glycoprotein (m), and the surface spike glycoprotein (s). the n protein is involved in packaging the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid, and it plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly [36] . the m protein is responsible for the assembly and immunogenicity of virus particles. the s protein mediates the entrance of the virus to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptor ace2. the s protein has two regions: s1, for host cell receptor binding; and s2, for membrane fusion. the s protein is a key target for the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics for coronavirus [15, 37, 38] . although the s protein is a promising immunogen for protection, optimizing antigen design is critical to ensure an optimal immune response. our vaccine contains a suitable adjuvant, htl, ctl, and b-cell epitopes that are joined by suitable linkers. furthermore, the epitopes were screened for their toxicity potential.the subunit vaccine was found to be thermostable, antigenic, and non-allergenic. molecular docking and md simulation provided insights about the interaction, stability, and dynamics of the vaccine-receptor complex. the data suggest constructive intermolecular interactions between the vaccine protein and the tlr-3 receptor. also, the in-silico cloning suggests the potential expression of the vaccine in a microbial expression system, thereby making it a potential vaccine against sars-cov-2 infection.the development of a vaccine is a lengthy and expensive process, with high failure rates, and it typically takes multiple candidates and several years to produce a commercial vaccine.upon optimization of the production process, the subunit vaccines can be rapidly tested and released in the market. they consist of only the antigenic portion of the pathogens that may directly elicit an immune response. additionally, the vaccine does not utilize live pathogen, thus, reducing the risk of pathogenicity reversal. hence, it can be used in immune-suppressed patients as well and elicit long-lived immunity. computational studies suggest that our multi-epitope based subunit vaccine has a probability of showing good protective efficacy and safety against sars-cov-2 infection in humans. we suggest the synthesis and experimental evaluation of this vaccine to determine its immunogenic potency.the authors acknowledge riken accc for the hokusai supercomputing resources. severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. sars cases were first observed in mid-november 2002 in guangdong province in southern china. the disease spread along international air travel routes to hanoi, hong kong, singapore, and toronto during february and march 2003 [1] . chains of secondary community transmission subsequently occurred in hospital settings, affecting doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff who were initially unaware of the new disease and its mode of transmission. although close contact was usually linked to viral transmission, cases were also observed after only incidental exposure [2] .sars was immediately perceived to be a global threat with a pandemic potential. after the initial development of nonspecific symptoms, the disease often progressed to severe lower respiratory disease requiring hospitalization and intensive care, with a high casefatality rate. predictors of mortality were shown to be advancing age (150% case-fatality in those у60 years of age), underlying chronic illness, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase concentration or white blood cell count at presentation [3] [4] [5] [6] . lung pathology specimens revealed hemophagocytosis and giant cells of macrophage origin, suggesting that the immune system plays an important role in pathogenesis [6, 7] . as a result, corticosteroids, in combination with ribavirin, were often administered as treatment, albeit with limited or no perceived benefit [8, 9] . on 12 march 2003 , the world health organization (who) issued a global alert on sars. with support from the who and other members of the international health community, authorities in affected regions implemented intense epidemiologic surveillance, rigorous adherence to infection-control procedures, strict practices of patient isolation, rigorous application of quarantine for asymptomatic contacts, and aggressive restrictions on travel. as a consequence of this international effort, sars outbreaks were contained by mid-july. the cumulative impact was limited to 8098 probable sars cases, with 774 fatalities [10] .despite this success, continued vigilance is indicated. much like influenza and other respiratory pathogens, human coronaviruses that cause common colds follow a winter-seasonal pattern, with peaks in late fall and late winter/early spring [11] . it is possible that the sars coronavirus (cov) will follow a similar pattern. in addition, there is currently neither an effective treatment for sars nor a vaccine to prevent infection. to help coordinate the robust research response needed to address the multidimensional sars threat, the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) convened a colloquium entitled sars: developing a research response on 30 may 2003 on the national institutes of health campus. participants included 1500 physicians, scientists, and policymakers from the united states, canada, china, europe, and elsewhere. the program was designed to facilitate interaction among participants in 5 areas of interest: sars clinical research, epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. the following 5 sections, with corresponding tables, represent the highlights of the discussions that took place on each of these topics. we conclude with a discussion of recent progress in sars research and an assessment of what research needs remain to be addressed.clinical manifestations. careful description of the clinical manifestations of sars, as well as correlation of the longitudinal course of disease with clinical, virologic, and immunologic parameters, is an important early goal for clinical research. these data would permit clinical investigators to develop a standard set of criteria to delineate progression and thus quantify the impact of different interventions on disease severity. moreover, systematic correlation of symptoms with histologic, cytologic, virologic, and immunologic evaluations of early and late changes in patient samples would greatly aid the understanding of sars pathogenesis.it is also important to identify host and viral factors that are predictors of disease progression. understanding the role of host genetics and laboratory surrogates would help to improve prognostic capabilities and allow identification of patients likely to benefit from aggressive interventions. such information might also be of value in the development of entry criteria for interventional studies.clinical virology. longitudinal evaluation of viral shedding by use of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and viral culture from the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and other sites would help in patient management and infection control; for example, routinely finding infectious virus in stool weeks after resolution of clinical illness would likely change recommendations with regard to isolation. such data would also provide information about sites of virus replication and show whether these evolve over the course of illness.previous studies of animal coronavirus infections have shown that small changes in viral envelope proteins can have a dramatic effect on both tissue tropism and clinical manifestations. for example, a single amino acid change in the s, or "spike," protein changes transmissible gastroenteritis virus from a predominantly respiratory pathogen into an intestinal pathogen [12] . for this reason, evaluation of viral quasi species obtained from different tissues, obtained from patients with different clinical manifestations of sars, and obtained over time from single patients could be very rewarding. error rates during transcription by coronavirus rna-dependent rna polymerases are typically on the order of 1 in 10 4 , which are similar to rates for hiv-1 reverse transcriptase. such high rates will likely cause substantial variation in the viral genome to occur over time, which could permit drug-resistant isolates to emerge. careful surveillance for the development of drug-resistant sars strains should, therefore, be part of any antiviral research protocol.clinical immunology. it is important to thoroughly understand cellular and humoral immune responses to the sars virus, including the impact of sars on immune function and any immunopathologic responses the virus may engender. study of the relationships between specific immune responses and subsequent clinical course would help to identify correlates of protective immunity, which would, in turn, be of great value in the development of vaccines and immune-based therapies.because an immunosuppressive element has been described in other coronavirus infections, examination of the effect of sars on the ability of the host to generate an immune response to other antigens is indicated. such research can be done through studies of immune response to recall antigens, such as tetanus toxoid, or to primary antigens, such as bacteriophage phi x 174. interpretation of such studies must clearly distinguish effects that are specific to sars virus infection from those that are generic to serious illness.better understanding of the role of the immune system in sars pathogenesis is critical and would help in the development of new therapeutic strategies. these deleterious responses may be specific, as in the case of cross-reacting autoantibodies, or nonspecific, as with an overly robust inflammatory response. the severe lymphopenia described in patients with sars remains a mystery, but it could be related to immune mechanisms. detailed study of bone marrow function and lymphocyte kinetics in individuals with sars may yield important clues to the cause of this anemia.international collaboration. a global network of research centers should be formed to test therapeutic approaches as they are developed and to help conduct the basic clinical research described above. these sars clinical centers must be located in countries where sars occurs and must have the cooperation of local communities. they must also be appropriately equipped and must have access to the requisite scientific expertise, including clinical trial design, pharmacology, and data management. to the extent possible, protocols for trials of therapies should be developed in advance of need. such trials must be designed to test new antiviral drugs, antibody therapies, and immunomodulatory approaches, such as the use of corticosteroids, and the trials must test the application of these therapies to both treatment of symptomatic patients and postexposure prophylaxis. (see therapeutics for further discussion of therapeutic development.)animal reservoirs. sars cov is almost certainly of zoonotic origin. coronaviruses have a broad host range in avian and mammalian species. the initial sars cases in guangdong province occurred among workers in food preparation and the restaurant industry, which suggests that practices associated with live-animal markets in this region were a source of human infections [13] . moreover, some workers in live-animal markets in shenzhen, china, showed serologic evidence of sars cov infection without a history of a sars-like illness. virologic surveillance in live-animal markets led to the isolation of coronaviruses closely related to sars cov. further study of the genetic diversity of related coronaviruses in a broad range of wild and domestic animals may help to identify potential animal reservoirs of sars cov, as well as virologic and environmental characteristics that favor zoonotic transmission. natural history. little is known about the natural history of sars cov infection. it is also critical that the reproductive rate (r o ) be quantified in different subpopulations, settings, and climates. initial estimates suggest that r o is ∼3, considerably less than for highly transmissible viruses, such as influenza virus. r o may change seasonally, and a relatively small change may determine whether the virus becomes established in the human population. moreover, the effect of host factors, especially age, on viral transmission remains to be clarified. children infected with sars cov experience much less severe illness, whereas people 160 years of age suffer severe disease and high mortality; however, it is not yet clear how the probability of viral transmission varies among age groups. similarly, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection, the possibility of transmission through an oral-fecal route or through blood transfusion, and the presence of host genetic factors that affect susceptibility have yet to be determined. finally, the viral, host, and environmental factors that caused so-called "super-spreader" incidents, in which many people are infected by a single individual, should be elucidated as quickly as possible. infection-control strategies. currently, the only available strategy for the control of sars is isolation and quarantine. because these procedures will be needed to address sars and other emerging infectious agents, the social and psychological consequences of isolation and quarantine should be studied, and incentives for people to adhere to implemented policies should be assessed. the efficacy of other infection-control techniques, such as screening for febrile passengers in airports, should also be examined.international collaboration. the experience with sars underscores the need to establish collaborative international disease surveillance and research networks, especially in southeast asia. in march, the who rapidly established a global network of sars research centers, modeled on a network of influenza surveillance and research centers already in place, which helped to facilitate the isolation and identification of sars cov and the complete genomic sequencing of multiple isolates. ultimately, internationally supported, on-site collaborative networks such as these will allow rapid exchange of information and reagents among skilled professionals and, therefore, enhance research for sars and other emerging infectious disease threats.beyond the establishment of collaborative centers, it is of utmost importance that scientists worldwide share all available epidemiologic data with regard to sars. only analyses of pooled data from all affected countries can adequately clarify such complex issues as the role of "super spreaders," diarrhea, and other factors affecting transmission; the identification of risk factors for severe disease outcome; and the benefits of various treatment strategies. establishing a database linking epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data from individuals with sars worldwide would therefore be of tremendous benefit.during the winter months, the diagnostic challenges of differentiating sars from other infections is especially great. this means that it is essential to develop diagnostic assays that can differentiate sars cov from other respiratory pathogens rapidly, simply, and precisely. it is also important to develop diagnostic tests that are not disease specific but can rapidly recognize the presence of other known and novel pathogens.serologic assays. sars cov was initially identified using cell culture inoculation and passage, followed by electron microscopy and genome sequence analysis. standard elisas, neutralization tests, and immunofluorescent antibody assays were developed immediately thereafter. use of these tests demonstrated that individuals with sars develop specific antibodies against the virus that do not cross-react with other human coronaviruses and that are not present widely in the population. these serologic tests are now widely available in countries where active sars cov transmission has occurred. igg antibodies, however, do not appear for at least 10 days after infection. because igm antibodies typically appear earlier, igm capture assays should be developed. similarly, measurement of sars cov-specific iga antibodies in rapid tests designed for use with oral fluids could prove useful.pcr assays. the first complete genome sequence for sars cov was available within 8 weeks after the initial who global alert, and 140 distinct isolates have since been deposited in genomic databases [14] . the availability of the sars nucleotide sequence allowed rapid development of standard and reversetranscriptase pcr assays that can detect sars cov rna in respiratory secretions, lung and kidney tissues, and stool and urine specimens. pcr assays are exquisitely sensitive, with a detection limit of ∼10-100 copies of the target rna. however, the presence of viral rna does not necessarily indicate the presence of infectious virus, and the method's exceptional sensitivity may lead to false-positive results because of cross-contamination and other factors. continued work to standardize the performance of pcr assays for sars and to determine optimal protocols remains a high priority.reagent repositories. reagents such as infectious virus, viral rna, inactivated and recombinant antigens, and sars cov-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are essential tools for the development of diagnostic assays, as are wellvalidated clinical specimens from individuals with sars. global public health authorities should therefore continue to coordinate the collection, storage, and distribution of this material, perhaps through existing or new who collaborating research centers. alternatively, the niaid might consider including this material in the reagent repository now planned to support assay nonhuman primate and smallanimal models development for bioterror threat agents. moreover, because initial development of diagnostic assays and reagents can also be done using specimens from animal models, improvement of such models should continue.antiviral drug screening. although antiviral chemotherapy and prophylaxis will be of great importance in the control of sars, no clinically proven candidates currently exist. working collaboratively, the united states army medical research institute of infectious diseases, the niaid, and the centers for disease control and prevention established a sars antiviral drug-screening laboratory in march 2003. the assay used at that laboratory measured how much candidate compounds inhibit cytopathic effects of sars cov growing in cultured vero cells. initially, the antiviral drugs screened included those that are us food and drug administration approved, those in clinical development, and those for which preclinical data suggested activity against a potential viral target protein. some in vitro activity against sars cov was observed with certain preparations of interferon-a and -b, as well as with rimantadine at high concentrations and a cysteine protease inhibitor. antiviral drug design. molecular virologic and genetic studies of sars cov and other coronaviruses suggest several possible molecular targets for antiviral drugs. these include viral binding, fusion, and other activities mediated by the glycoprotein spike on the coronavirus surface, as well as the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase, the papain-like cysteine protease, and the chymotrypsin-picornavirus 3c-like protease. inhibitors of surface hemagglutinin-esterase or other activities involved in release of virus from cell surfaces may also represent a class of useful antiviral drugs. molecular modeling and drug design strategies should continue to be pursued to develop compounds that modulate these viral activities.immunomodulation and other therapies. available clinical and histopathologic data suggest that immune-mediated injury may be an important mechanism in sars pathogenesis, particularly late in the course of illness. thus, it would be useful to assess the use of immunomodulatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, either by themselves or in combination with antivirals. the effectiveness of administration of immunoglobulins with neutralizing activity against sars cov, for both therapy and prophylaxis, should also be examined.preclinical studies. both nonhuman primate and smallanimal models are needed for sars antiviral drug development. mouse hepatitis virus, a group ii murine coronavirus, has been well characterized in mice and may prove to be useful in this regard, although it may differ significantly from sars cov. it may in the end prove necessary to develop several models to address different aspects of the pathogenesis of sars, such as systemic versus respiratory tract infection. the niaid should also strengthen its ability to produce sufficient supplies of promising experimental compounds to conduct preclinical toxicology studies and should continue to expand biocontainment laboratory facilities, a shortage of which has significantly inhibited antiviral development.collaboration between the us food and drug administration and antiviral drug developers should occur at early stages of the development process, both to assess preclinical data and to plan clinical studies. clinical trial networks, such as the niaid's collaborative anti-viral studies group (casg), should be expanded and strengthened, particularly to include sites in countries where sars has occurred. collaborative clinical protocols should be prepared; casg has developed a clinical protocol that could be used as a template for the establishment of such collaborative studies. these clinical protocols should look not only at disease progression but also at titer of excreted virus and duration of excretion, which are probable markers for the likelihood of transmission.basic science. because sars has just emerged, many important basic science issues have not yet been fully explored. these include the identity of the cellular receptor for the virus, the pathogenic mechanisms that cause disease, the initial routes of infection, and the role that enteric infection plays in pathogenesis or transmission. immunologic issues that warrant intense study include the relative roles of innate and adaptive immunity, a detailed description of the immunologic response throughout the course of disease, whether patients are immune from reinfection after recovery, and what immune system changes might confer immunity. experience to date indicates that the immune response might play a role in sars pathogenesis, which has important implications for both treatment and vaccine development. it is encouraging that useful vaccines for some animal coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus, have been developed using various strategies, including live-attenuated, whole-killed, and subunit approaches. however, experimental vaccines based on these strategies directed against feline infectious peritonitis virus enhance disease in immunized animals. it is crucial, therefore, that any immune responses that contribute to disease be identified as soon as possible and that sars vaccine candidates be evaluated for the possibility that they might potentiate disease.vaccine development. given the need for quick development of a safe and effective sars vaccine, multiple strategies for vaccine development should be pursued simultaneously. these include the development of live-attenuated and whole-killed vaccine candidates, in addition to other strategies that elicit strong t cell responses, such dna-based vaccines and engineered adenovirus vectors, as well as those that elicit production of neutralizing antibodies. adjuvants that confer longer-lived protective mucosal and systemic immune responses should also be pursued. finally, subunit vaccines based on s protein fragments and pep-tides and epitope-based t cell vaccines, formulated with new adjuvants that target toll-like receptors, should also be developed.preclinical testing. animal models of sars cov infection are needed to test the safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines. a reagent repository from which researchers could obtain recombinant viral proteins, multiple spike proteins, monoclonal antibodies, plasmids, and immune and control patient sera would be extremely helpful, as would a molecular and immunology database containing descriptions of t and b cell epitopes and sars cov genomic data.moving candidate sars vaccines rapidly through scientific and regulatory evaluation will require a coordinated effort of government, academic, and industrial organizations. these groups should work together to identify potential barriers to product licensing and should cooperatively develop plans for widespread testing and deployment of promising vaccine preparations in countries where sars exists.the first wave of sars was controlled by vigorous international application of the time-tested techniques of isolation and quarantine, and the international research response was both forceful and cooperative. in short order, the virus that causes sars was identified and sequenced, first-generation diagnostic tests were developed and distributed, and development of both antiviral therapies and vaccines was initiated. much of this progress was achieved through an international network of research sites that was built largely on a preexisting influenza network. it is a reflection of the astonishingly rapid pace of sars research that the niaid meeting summarized above, at which a great many fundamental insights into sars were described, occurred only 10 weeks after the initial who global health alert.progress in sars research has continued, even as the first wave of the disease has subsided, and several identified research needs have been at least partially met. for example, in vitro screening of antiviral candidates against sars cov is now moving at an accelerated pace as a result of the recent introduction of high-throughput assays that can screen up to 1000 compounds per week. in addition, many sars vaccine candidates are in development around the world, and preliminary results from tests in mice and nonhuman primates indicate that neutralizing antibodies are protective; some vaccine candidates that elicit neutralizing antibodies may shortly enter human trials [15] .by the same token, however, several needs that cut across various fields of sars research remain unfulfilled (table 6) , although some progress has been reported in many of these areas as well. the most pressing of these needs are described below.methods for early identification of individuals with sars. many pcr and serologic diagnostic kits are available, and other diagnostic tools are under development [16] . existing [17] reported that real-time pcr, coupled with an improved rna extraction method, allows detection of viral rna in nasopharyngeal aspirates with 80% specificity, a considerable improvement over first-generation procedures. this research was made possible by the availability of a set of well-characterized clinical samples from individuals with confirmed sars, coupled with matched controls. rigorous testing of diagnostic procedures using standardized samples remains a challenge to the international community, however. in addition, a more complete understanding of where in the body the virus can be found at different stages of the disease might lead to new diagnostic strategies. for example, the report that sars cov can replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in individuals with sars shortly after the onset of symptoms indicates that blood might be an appropriate clinical specimen for diagnosis [18, 19] . availability of a highly accurate and specific diagnostic assay that could detect sars cov before or shortly after the onset of symptoms would be a tremendously valuable public health tool in any future sars outbreaks [20] . sars pathogenesis and immune response. a complete understanding of sars pathogenesis, together with a full picture of the human immune response, has not yet been achieved. in this regard, it is particularly important to understand what role, if any, the human immune response plays in severe disease outcomes. a recent report describing changes in cytokine concentrations in 61 patients seropositive for sars cov in beijing at early, peak, and recovery stages of the disease indicates that the immune system responds abnormally to the virus [21] . this is the kind of study that can provide useful insights into both pathogenic mechanisms and the effectiveness of experimental therapies. another report indicates that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for sars cov [22] . further work to systematically unravel all aspects of how sars cov interacts with its human host at the molecular and physiologic levels will help ensure rapid development of therapeutic techniques, diagnostic assays, and vaccines. sars animal models. it has been shown that the virus will replicate in several small animals, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, mice, domestic cats, and nonhuman primates; researchers have a variety of animal models from which to choose. the development of vaccines and therapeutic strategies will rely on several different models, because each will have advantages in different experimental settings. however, no animal model described to date can reliably mimic the respiratory symptoms seen in humans with sars. a recent report indicates that sars-infected ferrets become ill, although these animals show no evidence of pneumonia [23] . follow-up work on these and other animals might lead to the discovery of an animal model that reproduces sars symptoms in humans.enhanced mechanisms for international cooperation. access to well-characterized specimens and reagents is still a limiting factor for many avenues of sars research, although some progress has been made [13, 24, 25] . moreover, increased compilation and analysis of existing epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical data from multiple sars-affected areas would speed research. for example, no single site has had a sufficient number of "super-spreading" events to provide enough data to completely explain them; however, data pooled from many sites in different countries would provide a much greater chance of explaining this important phenomenon. similarly, data on the success or failure of the various treatment strategies already attempted should be rigorously compared and analyzed. finally, although protocols for clinical testing of therapeutic and vaccine candidates have been prepared, common protocols should be implemented across multiple international sites, and data acquired during these trials should be made widely available as they are acquired.to combat sars, the international public health community must effectively harness the experience and creative talents of laboratory scientists, public health workers, physicians, and other health care workers all over the world. although the intense effort exerted in the first months of 2003 controlled the initial outbreaks, we must not be lulled into a false sense of security. the pandemic potential of sars, a novel agent transmitted via respiratory secretions, remains present today. it serves as a reminder that the emergence of pathogens, whether natural or intentional, can have devastating human and economic costs. for these reasons, planning efforts for future pandemics must be sufficiently flexible to cope with any emerging respiratory virus. performing the research needed to effectively counter sars will require both a continued global investment of human and financial resources and an ongoing commitment to collaborative sharing of data and materials.first discovered in the democratic republic of the congo in 1976, the highly lethal ebola virus has infected people in a number of african countries leading to sporadic outbreaks of ebola virus disease over the past 40 years. while most of the outbreaks have been limited in geographic scope and number of cases, two of the outbreaks over the last 6 years have been large, resulting in major loss of life and socioeconomic disruption in the region. in early 2014, an outbreak of ebola virus disease caused by zaire ebolavirus started in west africa and was declared a public health emergency of international concern in august of that year. by the time the outbreak ended in 2016, more than 11,000 people had died and more than 28,000 people were infected primarily in three countries, guinea, liberia, and sierra leone 1 .in the decade prior to the west african outbreak, research efforts for biodefense purposes resulted in the identification of some promising ebola vaccine candidates that protected monkeys from a lethal challenge of wild-type ebola virus 2 . these vaccine candidates were not taken into clinical development prior to the west african outbreak for several reasons, which included the inability to demonstrate clinical efficacy in the absence of an ongoing outbreak and lack of interest by the public health and vaccine development community to invest in the lengthy and costly process of vaccine development without a clear demand for an ebola vaccine 2 . the west african outbreak changed this perspective and numerous vaccines entered clinical development during the outbreak resulting in the generation of safety and immunogenicity data for many of these novel vaccine candidates and the demonstration of efficacy for one vaccine 3 .ervebo® is a live, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rvsv)-based, chimeric-vector vaccine, where the vsv envelope g protein was deleted and replaced by inserting only the envelope glycoprotein of zaire ebolavirus. extraordinary efforts were made to advance this vaccine candidate through phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials and the data generated in the context of the west african ebola outbreak has supported its licensure by the us food and drug administration (fda), conditional authorization by the european medicines agency (ema) and several african countries, along with prequalification by the who. the period of 5 years from the start of phase 1 trials in oct 2014 to the approval of this vaccine in nov 2019, was much faster than the typical 10-15 year timeline for vaccine development and approval 4 . a timeline of the key activities in the development of this ebola vaccine is summarized in fig. 1 and described in detail in the following sections of this article. through this ebola vaccine development effort a number of learnings have been identified, which are highly relevant for the current vaccine development efforts in response to the covid-19 pandemic. a summary of the key lessons learned can be found in fig. 2 field response and non-governmental service organizations (such as medecins sans frontieres); global public health entities (such as the world health organization, wellcome trust, and gavi); universities (e.g., the university of geneva, dalhousie university) and private sector companies (such as newlink genetics, idt biologika, and msd).each of these entities had a specific role in the broad partnership, including conducting preclinical studies, manufacturing good manufacturing practices (gmp) trial materials, conducting clinical trials, and funding portions of the research and development. msd has a well-established history in manufacturing and clinical development of vaccines, with experience in taking novel vaccines through the regulatory process to approval and providing global access. however, msd did not have prior experience with ebola virus nor clinical development expertise in the african countries in which the ebola outbreak was taking place. therefore, msd relied on the expertise of organizations that were already involved in the public health response efforts to implement and complete nearly all the clinical trials. important lessons from this effort are that leveraging the expertise of different organizations can help to accelerate product development and that broad public-private partnerships require strong leadership and coordination to facilitate cooperation of diverse partners with different expertise and missions.furthermore, concerns over evaluation of any investigational product are present in less developed parts of the world and these concerns may be further exacerbated during an outbreak 5 . therefore, clear and transparent communication with community leaders and the community at large, ethical review committees, local ministries of health, and other government agencies is critical to ensure that the purpose of the research is well understood and aligned with accepted local and international norms. failure to do so can result in delays or roadblocks to research on potentially life-saving products.ultimately the responsibility to convert the data generated by all the collaborators into a coherent regulatory submission to support licensure of a product lies with the marketing authorization holder. recognition and proactive planning for that eventuality can help to accelerate the regulatory submission to support product approval. examples of these types of activities include the following.data integration msd's role in advancing the product to licensure included integrating all the data generated by partners to support the marketing authorization applications. nine of 13 nonclinical studies, 1 of 2 clinical assay validations, and 11 of 12 clinical trials were performed by partners. msd needed to obtain all the datasets and reports from these partners to include in the license applications. data from clinical trials that were performed by partners needed to be migrated into a central database that could be used for data integration, analysis, report-writing, and submission by msd to regulatory agencies. a lesson learned during this process is to account for the time needed to convert different formats and languages used to collect the data into standard formats required by regulatory agencies, such as use of the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra) and study data tabulation model (sdtm).with the clinical trials all being designed and implemented in the context of the outbreak, it was not possible to harmonize the study designs. while this is not an issue a priori for the conduct of the trials, it introduced challenges when assembling the data to support licensure. for example, it was not possible to conduct extensive integration of the safety data for the product because the data collected and methods used were different for each trial. a key lesson learned during this process is that standardization of clinical trial protocols and data collection is preferred, and that to the extent possible late stage clinical trial designs should be defined prior to outbreaks. another challenge specifically related to conducting trials in response to emerging diseases is that there is a need to build clinical development capacities, laboratory and adverse event reporting infrastructure in outbreak-prone regions. this was a challenge taken on by individual trial sponsors in the affected countries and required significant and sustained support by the trial sponsors and their local partners. establishing mechanisms to maintain the capabilities established during outbreak response to provide experienced clinical trial sites for future research is another key lesson learned. examples of this in action include the ongoing partnership between the us and liberia and the partnership for research on ebola vaccination (prevac) consortium established in the wake of the west africa outbreak.clinical assays a key immunogenicity endpoint assay was developed and validated through a collaborative effort by private and public sector partners. the intent was to provide an assay available to all vaccine developers, which might ultimately allow comparison of different vaccine candidates. while the collaborative effort was successful, balancing the input of numerous partners took time. consequently, clinical assay validation took two years to complete, resulting in a back-log of samples from clinical trials that needed to be processed. a lesson learned is that whenever possible clinical immunogenicity sample collection should be standardized and assays should be validated prior to the start of late stage clinical trials. this requires knowledge of the target pathogen well in advance of clinical trials, which is a challenge for sars-cov-2.expanded access use of the vaccine prior to approval with the rapid collection of efficacy data in support of the vaccine, it was recognized that there was the possibility that new ebola outbreak(s) could occur ahead of the licensure and availability of licensed doses and that a mechanism was needed to support access to the investigational product. for this scenario, it was necessary to manufacture doses to support outbreak response and establish regulatory frameworks needed to support vaccine deployment (e.g., compassionate use, expanded access, or emergency use). the who, msf, and other groups took the lead in implementing expanded access protocols in african countries, working closely with national governments and ministries of health. through this effort, more than 300,000 people were vaccinated during the 2018-2020 ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of the congo 6 . a lesson learned is that the deployment of an investigational product requires careful consideration and thorough planning.the manufacturing process had to be rapidly scaled-up to handle the needs for emergency use and expanded access programs, in addition to establishing a final manufacturing facility. the approach taken by msd was to take the initial manufacturing process that was developed at a contract manufacturing organization, scale it up in a clinical manufacturing facility, and transfer it to a commercial manufacturing facility. technology transfer and the establishment of a new manufacturing facility has many steps and requires significant time to execute (3-4 years is typical for a new vaccine). there is limited understanding outside of vaccine manufacturers and regulators on the rigorous requirements leading to approval of a vaccine manufacturing facility. this broad lack of understanding can lead to misperceptions of "delays" when in fact timelines are driven by the elements required for licensure. for example, although clinical data were available in 2017-2018, the vaccine could not be approved until the commercial manufacturing site was established due to expectations from regulatory agencies that the manufacturing process needs to be validated at the final manufacturing site. a lesson learned is that education is needed on how vaccines are manufactured and the time needed to establish and gain approval for a new manufacturing facility. this is particularly relevant for the clinical • exisɵng preclinical data on the vaccine plaƞorm can accelerate the start

aspects of vaccine development are being accelerated at an extraordinary pace with the goal of being able to produce unprecedented quantities of vaccine to address global needs.manufacturing site selection for vaccines is a complex decision, which is further complicated when seeking to move fast with incomplete information. the company needed to manage multiple factors, such as existing space, technical capability, infrastructure, and capacity. site selection also needed to account for the regulations in the country in which the manufacturing site is located and the permits and licenses necessary to support the efforts. the country's employment environment and labor laws can also impact the ability to hire qualified staff quickly where these factors need to be considered early. a lesson learned is that aggressive timelines are enticing for public health partners, but also require "right-first-time" execution to qualify the facility and manufacturing process, for which the probability of success for a new vaccine is likely medium to low. all parties involved must work to balance the desire to be ambitious (e.g., rapid development timelines) with execution realities and stakeholder expectations. parallel work and extensive collaboration between manufacturers will be needed in order to successfully bring a sars-cov-2 vaccine to the world.regulatory agency collaboration is critical for success from the start of the west african ebola outbreak, the us fda, ema, and health canada worked closely with each other and with the national regulatory authorities of the impacted west african countries, sharing information about candidate vaccines that were being tested and reviewing the clinical protocols, available data, and benefit-risk profiles. frequent conversations with manufacturers helped the agencies expedite the start of clinical trials simultaneously in different countries. a lesson learned is that existing preclinical data and availability of clinical supplies afforded the opportunity to start phase 1 trials rapidly during the west african ebola outbreak.clinical data requirements for licensure need to be clearly defined placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies are typically used to demonstrate the efficacy and safety for new vaccines. however, in the midst of the ebola outbreak, some countries considered it unethical to administer placebo to at-risk individuals. different study designs were implemented for the phase 2/3 trials and a cluster-randomized trial conducted by the world health organization in guinea was the only trial that demonstrated efficacy 7 . efficacy data from this trial, together with safety data from 12 trials and immunogenicity data with validated assays, were accepted for registration by regulatory agencies. a lesson learned is that the regulatory pathway to licensure for pandemic vaccines need to be clearly defined. novel trial designs might need to be implemented in order to maximize the possibility of evaluating efficacy during a waning outbreak, and alternative endpoints, such as using immune responses as a surrogate for efficacy, could be used to gain accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization.frequent regulatory agency interactions are important based primarily on interim clinical efficacy data, the manufacturer applied for and was granted access to expedited regulatory pathways, such as priority medicines (prime) status from ema and breakthrough therapy designation (btd) from fda, which helped to obtain alignment on data requirements for product approval using frequent meetings. under btd, the fda accepted rolling submissions of portions of the biologics license application (bla), which resulted in approval in december 2019, three months before fda's target approval date. the fda determined that a program specific advisory committee meeting was not needed. similar frequent discussions with ema under prime status, enabled the company to gain alignment on key aspects of the development program quickly.who leadership is needed to obtain rapid global approvals who is a recognized global public health leader with regional offices in many countries, and established connections with the african vaccines regulatory forum (avaref). in order to accelerate vaccine access to african countries, the world health organization's prequalification team (who-pqt) in collaboration with the ema and avaref developed an innovative facilitated process (roadmap) for decision making on the acceptability of the vaccine for registration 8 . this allowed the company to make simultaneous submissions to ema, who-pqt, and regulatory authorities in 14 african countries, with ema acting as the reference agency. following submission, the who-pqt and members from avaref, which represented the 14 african countries, were invited to participate in teleconferences between msd and ema and in the inspection of the manufacturing facility. after a positive opinion from ema in october 2019, the european commission granted a conditional marketing authorization on november 11th. within 36 h, the who granted prequalification. one month later, african countries started to approve ervebo®, starting with burundi and the democratic republic of the congo. a lesson learned is that strong collaboration and willingness to share information with everyone involved resulted in registration nearly-simultaneously in the countries that needed the ebola vaccine. for sars-cov-2 vaccines, regulatory agencies should prepare for the simultaneous approval of candidates in multiple countries. who's leadership will be needed to facilitate innovative review processes and collaborative mechanisms to expedite approvals.recombinant viral vaccines need to overcome additional regulatory hurdles since this ebola vaccine was a recombinant virus, some countries required a detailed environmental risk assessment prior to the start of clinical trials and as part of the marketing authorization application. in some countries, the vaccine was considered a bio-safety level 2 organism, requiring special handling and permits for the manufacturing and testing sites. these permits took a significant amount of time to obtain, which prevented rapid transfers of material. samples and technology, which even included parts of the marketing authorization application, required licenses for export because this vaccine is made from the genetic sequence of two viruses that are considered "dualuse" agents and subject to trade controls. a lesson learned is that these regulations led to delays and additional costs incurred in starting clinical trials, manufacturing, testing, and shipments. for manufacturers of sars-cov-2 vaccines, countries should consider waiving these requirements, or waiving the fees and expediting these processes.harmonized labeling and packaging requirements would facilitate pandemic vaccines distribution after approval, companies face challenges with product distribution due to the need to follow country-specific product labeling regulations covering package inserts, cartons, and artwork in addition to serialization requirements. this causes a supply chain issue for a vaccine product intended to be placed in a stockpile and diverted quickly to any country. a lesson learned is that these heterogenous requirements counter the goal of flexibility, speed, and cost-efficiency relevant to emergency preparedness, and there is an urgent need for harmonized solutions. electronic labeling and quick response (qr) codes could be a possible solution, but in most countries, legislation does not currently exist to support this option. there is an urgent need to find a solution to this problem for pandemic vaccines.in addition to considering lessons related to vaccine development for epidemic preparedness, it is equally important to consider the unique challenges and opportunities related to sustainable manufacturing, supply, access, and delivery of these vaccines at the scale and speed needed to achieve preparedness and response goals. such challenges include right-sizing manufacturing capacity and production while having to accommodate leadtimes, managing uncertain demand-and-supply dynamics, ensuring equitable allocation and access, and achieving operational and economic sustainability for all partners. producing and supplying any vaccine is inherently complex. it is exponentially more complex when there are high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability across nearly every dimension of the program: unpredictable disease, unpredictable and relatively low demand, unpredictable stakeholders and customers, unpredictable timing of need, and unpredictable geographies in which needs might arise. policy, program, and system innovation-in parallel to research and development innovation-needs to be addressed to realize the full promise of innovative, new vaccines in advancing global public health preparedness.emergency preparedness and response vaccines, such as ervebo®, are critical tools in the arsenal against pathogens that can cause pandemics. public-private partnerships are a powerful and effective approach to develop these vaccines. setting clear roles, expectations, and accountability enables each partner to bring their respective strengths to the effort. shared purpose, trust, flexibility, and cooperation are critical to ensure success.as highlighted in this report and in another recent article 9 , the variability and complexity in regulatory processes and requirements interfere with the speed, flexibility, and efficiency needed to prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. there is an urgent need for global regulatory harmonization and standardization in the approach to the development of vaccines for emergency preparedness. regulatory agencies need to work together to remove roadblocks and put solutions in place to allow the rapid global development of vaccines for sars-cov-2 and other emerging pathogens.received: 19 may 2020; accepted: 3 june 2020;severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) is a novel infectious disease caused by sars coronavirus (sars-cov), which led to several hundred deaths among thousands of cases. although sars has been successfully contained, re-emergence of sars-cov from animal reservoirs is still a potential risk for future epidemic, which is supported by continual reports of finding sars-cov-like coronavirus in small animals, such as civets, raccoon dogs [1] [2] [3] and bats [4, 5] . sars outbreak may also recur in the future by the virus escaping from laboratory accidents [6, 7] . therefore, development of safe and effective sars vaccines for prevention of sars-cov infection is an important issue on current sars research.sars-cov, the causative agent of sars, contains the genome encoding the nonstructural replicase polyprotein (rep) and structural proteins spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m) and nucleocapsid (n) [8, 9] . its s protein is responsible for virus binding to the receptor, angiotensin-converting 0264-410x/$ -see front matter © 2006 elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006. 10 .031 enzyme 2 (ace2), and subsequent virus entry into the host cells [10, 11] . the s protein of sars-cov has also been demonstrated to be the main antigen in inducing high titer of neutralizing antibodies [12] [13] [14] , and in eliciting protective immunity against infection in challenged animals [15] [16] [17] . thus, it is implied to be the main target in development of sars vaccines.a number of vaccine candidates based on sars-cov s have been reported in terms of their abilities in inducing neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity [15, [18] [19] [20] . these candidates can be grouped into inactivated virusesbased, protein-based, dna-based and virus-based vaccines [18, [20] [21] [22] [23] . many viruses, including vsv, rhabdovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (aav), modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) and attenuated parainfluenza virus, have been used for expressing sars-cov s protein as sars vaccine candidates [12, 15, [24] [25] [26] [27] . bukreyev et al. [24] reported that vaccination of african green monkeys with an attenuated parainfluenza virus encoding sars-cov s resulted in production of sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies and protection of animals from virus challenge. these findings suggest that s protein of sars-cov is a good target for development of sars-cov vaccines.since most dna-based and virus-based vaccine candidates have still caused some safety concerns, proteinbased vaccine may be an alternative candidate. indeed, the full-length s protein or its s1 subunit could induce potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized animals [13, 25, 28] . however, it may also elicit antibodies that enhance virus infection [25, 29] or cause liver damage in animals challenged with sars-cov [23] . in this regard, the receptor-binding domain (rbd), a fragment of the s protein, which has been demonstrated to be a major neutralization determinant, has implied to be an ideal candidate for development of subunit vaccines against sars [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . in this study, we further evaluated its long-term immune responses and protective immunity against sars-cov infection in a mouse model.the bj01 strain of sars-cov (genbank accession no. ay278488) was propagated in vero e6 cells under the conditions of the biosafety level 3 laboratories (bsl-3) [35, 36] . titer of this virus strain was determined by the 50% tissue-culture infectious dose (tcid 50 ) in vero e6 cells. a 193-aa rbd domain of sars-cov s protein (residues 318-510) fused with the fc domain of human igg1 (rbd-fc) was produced as described previously [30, 31] . briefly, a plasmid encoding rbd-fc fusion protein was transfected into hek293t cells using fugene 6 transfection reagents (boehringer mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol. supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection. recombinant rbd-fc protein was purified by protein a-sepharose 4 fast flow (amersham biosciences, usa). a full-length s protein of sars-cov urbani (accession no. ay278741) expressed in expressf +® insect cells with recombinant baculovirus d3252 was purchased from the protein sciences corporation (bridgeport, ct) [13, 14] .a group of five female balb/c mice at the age of 4-6 weeks were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10 g of purified rbd-fc resuspended in phosphate-buffered solution (pbs, ph 7.2) in the presence of freund's complete adjuvant (fca), and boosted twice with freshly prepared emulsion of 5 g immunogen and freund's incomplete adjuvant (fia) at 3-week intervals. the mice were boosted for the third time with the same amount of rbd-fc + fia 12 months after the first vaccination and were challenged with sars-cov 5 days later (fig. 1 ). mice injected with the same amount of pbs were used as the negative control. for each group, mouse sera were collected before immunization and at 1-month interval post-vaccination. sera were kept at −20 • c until use.mouse sera were tested against the recombinant sars-cov s protein by elisa. briefly, 1 g/ml of the recombinant s protein was coated to 96-well microtiter plates (corning costar, acton, ma) in 0.1 m carbonate buffer (ph 9.6) at 4 • c overnight. after blocking with 2% non-fat milk, serially diluted mouse sera were added and incubated at 37 • c for 1 h, followed by three washes with pbs containing 0.1% tween 20. bound antibodies were detected with hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg (zymed, south san francisco, ca) at 37 • c for 1 h. after three washes, the reaction was visualized by addition of the substrate 3,3 ,5,5 -tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) and measured for the absorbance at 450 nm (a450) by an elisa plate reader (victor 1420 multilabel counter, perkin-elmer, usa).titers of the neutralizing antibody in mouse sera vaccinated with the recombinant rbd-fc protein were detected in vero e6 cells as described by qu et al. [37] . briefly, vero e6 cells were seeded at 2 × 10 4 cells/well in 96-well culture plates and cultured at 37 • c for 24 h to form a monolayer. serial two-fold dilutions of serum samples were incubated with 100 tcid 50 of sars-cov bj01 strain at 37 • c for 1 h and subsequently added to the monolayer of vero e6 cells at tetrad. cells infected with 100 tcid 50 sars-cov and without the virus were applied as positive and negative controls, respectively. cytopathic effect (cpe) in each well was observed daily and recorded on day 3 post-infection. the neutralizing titers of mouse antisera that completely prevented cpe in 50% of the wells were calculated by reed-muench method.five days after the last boost with rbd-fc, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally (i.n.) inoculated with 50 l of diluted sars-cov bj01 strain (10 6 tcid 50 ) according to the national animal care and use guidelines in a bsl-3 laboratory. vaccinated mice were sacrificed 5 days after the challenge and lungs of the mice were removed. the lung tissues were stored at −80 • c for virological tests or were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4 • c for histopathological analysis.the viral rna copies in lung tissues were determined by q-rt-pcr according to the protocol described by zhai et al [38] . the limit of detection for live virus in lung samples was 1 × 10 3 copies/g. briefly, total rna was extracted from 20 mg of the lung tissues using rneasy mini kit (qiagen, hilden, germany) following the manu- the virus replication was determined by titration of the inoculated virus in lung tissues collected from sacrificed mice. briefly, the lung tissues were homogenized to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) suspension in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem) (invitrogen, usa). tissue homogenates were centrifuged, filtrated and inoculated into the monolayer of vero e6 cells seeded in 96-well tissue-culture plates. results were evaluated after 3 days of the culture under phase-contrast microscopy, and viral titers using a cpe-based tcid 50 test were calculated by reed-muench method. viral titers were expressed as log 10 tcid 50 /g of tissues, with the lowest detection limit of 1.5 log 10 tcid 50 /g. the total amount of virus was calculated by multiplying the weight of the lung tissues and the viral titers measured in 10% of tissue homogenates.the lung tissues were immediately fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin wax. sections were made at 4-6 m thickness and mounted on slides. histopathological changes caused by sars-cov infection were examined by haematoxylin and eosin (h&e) staining and viewed under light microscopy.as shown in fig. 2a , rbd-fc vaccination induced a prolonged and potent humoral immune response with igg specific to sars-cov s protein in the animals as tested by elisa, reaching the highest titer (1:1.5 × 10 5 ± 1.6 × 10 4 , mean ± se) at the 3rd and 4th month post-vaccination. although the titer decreased slightly afterwards, high titer of s-specific igg antibody maintained for at least 6 months until it dropped to 1:9.0 × 10 2 ± 1.6 × 10 2 at the end of the 7th month. specific igg antibody increased rapidly after the 3rd boost (12 months after the first vaccination) and reached the titer of 1:2.5 × 10 3 ± 7.7 × 10 2 before sars-cov challenge. fig. 2b further demonstrated that the antibodies induced by vaccination of rbd-fc exhibited strong neutralizing activity with a similar pattern of the elisa antibodies to rbd. the neutralizing antibodies reached the highest level at the 3rd month (1:4.0 × 10 3 ± 3.5 × 10 2 ) after the vaccination with rbd-fc. the neutralizing antibody level slightly decreased to 1:5.8 × 10 2 ± 1.0 × 10 2 by the end of the 6th month but dropped down to less than 1:40 at the end of the 12th month. the titer of the neutralizing antibody to sars-cov increased again after the third boost, reaching the titer of the titers of neutralizing antibodies were determined as the highest dilutions of sera that could completely prevent cpe in at least 50% of the wells and are presented as the geometric means ± se of five mouse sera in each group. 1:3.2 × 10 2 ± 1.9 × 10 2 before sars-cov challenge. however, neither elisa s-specific antibodies nor neutralizing antibodies were detected in the mouse sera from the control group.five days after challenged with sars-cov through the intranasal route, mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were collected. virus rna copies in the lung tissues were determined by q-rt-pcr and described as rna copies/g of tissues. as shown in table 1 , viral rna copies for both the rbd-fc group and the control group were negatively correlated with the titer of the neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov. the higher titer of the neutralizing antibodies was detected in the sera, the lower copy number of viral rna was found in the lung tissues. m1 mouse in the rbd-fc vaccination group developed the lowest titer of neutralizing antibody (1:57) and showed detectable viral rna copies (3.13 × 10 3 ), while no viral rna was detectable in lung tissues of the other four mice in this group as they presented higher titers of the neutralizing antibody (>1:189). similarly, no neutralizing antibody response in the pbs control group was correlated to the higher levels of rna copies in the lung tissues (1.39 × 10 5 to 3.77 × 10 7 ). these results suggested that the neutralizing antibodies induced by rbd-fc vaccination play an important role in prevention of sars-cov infection in virus challenged mice.sars-cov replication was detected by titration of the inoculated virus in lung tissues to evaluate the efficacy of rbd-fc vaccination in protecting sars-cov infection (fig. 3) . all of five mice in the control group vaccinated with pbs had high titers of virus replication in the lungs after the sars-cov challenge. however, the mice vaccinated with rbd-fc were either completely (four of five mice) or partially protected (one of five mice, m1 which showed lower level of neutralizing antibody in its serum) from sars-cov challenge. these data indicate that vaccination with rbd-fc a titers of neutralizing antibodies in sera collected from each mouse 5 days after the last vaccination and before the virus inoculation were determined. rna copies in the lung tissues of mice challenged with sars-cov were measured by q-rt-pcr and expressed as rna copies/g of lung tissues. m1-m5 and c1-c5 are rbd-fc-vaccinated mice and control mice, respectively. the limit of detection for live virus in the lung was 1 × 10 3 copies/g. is able to establish protective immunity to prevent mice from subsequent sars-cov challenge.histopathological changes in lungs from the rbd-fc vaccinated and control mice were observed on the h&e stained lung tissue sections. lung tissues from the control mice (injected with pbs) revealed significant histopathological changes, including diffuse alveolar damages characterized by disruption of alveolar walls and flooding of alveolar lumina with serosanguineous exudates admixed with neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, thickened alveolar walls lined by type 2 pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages in alveolar lumina (fig. 4a) . however, except m1 mouse with a mild level of the alveolar damage in lung tissues, other four rbd-fc vaccinated mice exhibited no significant histopathological changes, but showed similar histological structures as the normal mouse in lung tissues (fig. 4b) . these results further confirm that rbd-fc vaccine is able to prevent mice from subsequent sars-cov infection.development of effective and safe sars vaccines is crucial in prevention of re-occurrence of sars epidemic. among four structural proteins of sars-cov, s serves as the most important antigen for development of sars vaccines since it plays essential roles in the host cell tropism and virus entry, and its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity [13, 17, 20, 39, 40] . reports have shown that neutralizing antibodies against s protein protect vaccinated animals from sars-cov challenge, thus vaccines encoding the s protein and targeting the humoral immune responses/neutralizing antibodies are indispensable in preventing sars-cov infection [16, 17, 20, 28, 39, 40] .most of the currently reported sars vaccine candidates are based on the full-length s protein of sars-cov. although the full-length s protein-based vaccines can elicit neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity [13, 17, 20] , it has been reported that this kind of vaccines may also induce harmful inflammatory and immune responses [23, 29] . this has raised concerns about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines containing or encoding the full-length s protein. we thus proposed to use rbd, a fragment of s protein, rather than the full-length s protein, for development of a safe and effective sars subunit vaccine since it contains the major neutralizing epitopes [31, 32, 41] . our previous studies have shown that the recombinant rbd can induce high potent neutralizing antibodies against sars-cov and its variants only m1 mouse exhibited mild histopathological damages in lung tissues. but compared to the control mice, m1 mouse revealed a little damage such as thickened alveolar walls with interstitial mononuclear cells and lymphocytes infiltrates, and with congestion but no markedly hemorrhage or effusion in the alveolar spaces of lung tissues. [31, 34] , but we do not know whether the rbd-based vaccine can protect animals from sars-cov infection.in this study, we compared the antibody responses and protective immunity in mice vaccinated with rbd-fc and the control mice. we found that rbd-fc elicited potent and longterm humoral immune responses in vaccinated mice. high titers of sars-cov s-specific elisa antibodies and virus neutralizing antibodies were maintained for at least 6 months. although the antibodies dropped to a low level at the end of the 12th month, their titers rebound rapidly after the mice were re-boosted with rbd-fc. these vaccinated mice were protected from sars-cov challenge since no significant virus replication was detected in their lungs. notably, presence of high titers of the neutralizing antibody was a prerequisite for protective immunity. higher titer of neutralizing antibodies was associated with lower level of rna copies/virus replication and stronger protective activity against sars-cov challenge. among five mice vaccinated with rbd-fc, four mice possessing high titer of neutralizing antibodies exhibited no significant virus replication and histopathological changes in their lungs while only one mouse with low sera neutralizing antibody titer showed marginal level of virus rna copies, and mild histopathological changes. however, all of the five mice with undetectable neutralizing antibody in the control group presented high level of rna copies/virus replication, and obvious histopathological changes in their lungs. our results indicated that the neutralizing antibody produced in rbd-fc vaccinated mice plays a significant role in protection of mice from the virus challenge without causing immunopathological damages.in summary, the vaccines containing the rbd of sars-cov s protein may induce sufficient neutralizing antibodies and long-term protective immunity against sars-cov challenge in the established mouse model. this vaccine candidate may overcome the disadvantages of other vaccine candidates mentioned above, but protect the vaccinated mice from subsequent sars-cov challenge. our results suggest that rbd-fc vaccine can be further developed as an ideal subunit vaccine for prevention of sars epidemic.modified vaccinia virus ankara as antigen delivery system: how can we best use its potential? ingo drexler 1 , caroline staib 2 and gerd sutter 3,ã safety-tested modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) has been established as a potent vector system for the development of candidate recombinant vaccines. the versatility of the vector system was recently demonstrated by the rapid production of experimental mva vaccines for immunization against severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus. promising results were also obtained in the delivery of epstein-barr virus or human cytomegalovirus antigens and from the clinical testing of mva vectors for vaccination against immunodeficiency virus, papilloma virus, plasmodium falciparum or melanoma. moreover, mva is considered to be a prime candidate vaccine for safer protection against orthopoxvirus infections. thus, vector development to challenge dilemmas in vaccinology or immunization against poxvirus biothreat seems possible, yet the right choice should be made for a most beneficial use.poxviruses engineered to express foreign genes are established tools for target protein synthesis and vaccine development in biomedical research. a large packaging capacity for recombinant dna, precise virus-specific control of target gene expression, lack of persistence or genomic integration in the host, high immunogenicity as vaccine, and ease of vector and vaccine production were important features enabling this success story. concerns about the safety of poxviruses, including vaccinia virus (vv) as the former smallpox vaccine, have been addressed by the use of viruses that are replication-defective in human cells. among these, modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) can be considered as one of the virus strains of choice for preclinical and clinical research [1] .historically, mva was developed through attenuation by serial passage in primary chicken embryo cells to serve as a safer vaccine against smallpox (for a review see [2] ). after more than 570 passages in tissue culture mva had lost the broad cellular host range of vv, being unable to productively grow in many cells of mammalian origin. the concurrent avirulence of mva for laboratory animals and its entirely unproblematic use for primary smallpox vaccination in more than 100 000 humans founded a high safety profile for recombinant mva that, depending on the nature of the inserted target gene, can be used under conditions of biosafety level 1. the capacity to produce similar levels of viral and recombinant antigen when compared with replication-competent viruses is a relevant feature of mva vaccines. in recent years, significant progress has been made in the development of mva vaccine technologies.this review informs about the newest developments in the generation of recombinant mva and illustrates the principal features that have an impact on mva immunogenicity. we also describe advances made in the preclinical and clinical evaluation of mva as a secondgeneration poxvirus vaccine or for the delivery of heterologous antigens targeting infectious diseases and cancer. finally, we consider the compatibility of different mva exploitations and raise the question as to what future use priority should be given.recombinant mva are among the most promising live viral vector systems, because of their well-established safety and their versatility for the production of heterologous proteins. the recent engineering of recombinant mva to synthesize all components necessary for the assembly and delivery of alphavirus replicon particles serves as an elegant example of their application [3] . for most purposes, however, the generation of mva vectors is straightforward requiring a single genomic insertion mediated by homologous recombination between the virus genome and dna from a plasmid that carries one or two recombinant genes being placed under control of a vv-specific promoter ( figure 1 ). the sites of naturally occurring deletions within the mva genome or the classical gene loci encoding for the vv proteins thymidine kinase or hemagglutinin serve as sites for the insertion of recombinant gene sequences. there are several well-established techniques for clonal isolation of recombinant mva involving the coexpression of chromogenic agents (e.g. escherichia coli b-galactosidase and b-glucuronidase) or providing resistance against antimicrobials (e.g. e. coli xanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase) (for an overview see [2, 4] ). recently, methods relying on growth selection of recombinant mva have been developed. these protocols take advantage of selective propagation in cell cultures that are nonpermissive for non-recombinant mva. in one protocol, the vv host range gene k1l is transiently introduced into the mva genome and recombinant mva can subsequently be isolated in rabbit kidney rk-13 cells [4, 5] . after clonal isolation of the vector virus, the k1l marker gene is again removed from the viral genome bearing the advantage that the same marker can be re-used subsequently to generate mva recombinant viruses harboring multiple gene insertions. another recently developed host range selection technique relies on growth rescue of mutant mva in chicken embryo fibroblast (cef) cells [6] . mva-de3l lacks the interferon resistance gene e3l mva as antigen delivery system drexler, staib and sutter 507 and is unable to grow in cef. stable re-insertion of the e3l gene together with a target gene sequence allows for quick isolation of mva recombinant viruses on cef.in the 1970s, highly attenuated mva was primarily considered to provide a means for safer vaccination against smallpox. although there was knowledge about its avirulence and immunostimulating capacity from infection experiments in multiple animal models, more systematic efforts to characterize the molecular basis of mva vaccine immunogenicity date from the more recent past. important achievements include the characterization of the mva molecular life cycle upon infection of non-permissive mammalian cells, the elucidation of the mva genome, and our understanding that mva has lost relevant poxvirus immune evasion genes that target innate host responses based on cytokine and chemokine functions. consequently, defects in inhibitory virus genes are likely to be responsible for the mva-specific induction of host cytokine synthesis proposed decades ago (for a review see [2] ). interestingly, inactivation of the vv interferon resistance gene e3l in the mva genome resulted in enhanced production of type i interferon in cefs, suggesting that the capacity of mva to stimulate innate responses may be further enhanced by rational mutagenesis [6] . it can be assumed that such immunostimulation contributes to the particular immunogenicity of mva and might compensate for the advantage of live replication-competent vv in sustained antigen production. in contrast to other viruses (e.g. members of the herpesvirus family), mva or replication-competent vv do not appear to specifically interfere with host cell antigen processing or presentation, allowing for an apparently unimpaired induction of adaptive immune responses. this assumption is in agreement with the finding that vv-specific humoral and cellular immunity can be detected decades after primary vaccination [7] . when recently compared with conventional vv vaccines, mva vaccines were found to elicit similar patterns of vv-specific immune responses that provided protection against experimental orthopoxvirus infections but required inoculation of higher dosage [8 ,9, comparative monitoring of epitope-specific cd8 + t-cell responses directed against vaccinia virus and recombinant antigens. quantitation of epitope-specific t cells was performed following one immunization of humanized hla-a*0201-transgenic mice with 10 8 iu of either wild-type mva (mva-wt), recombinant mva-tyr or mva-h2n expressing the human tumor antigens tyrosinase and her-2/neu, respectively. ten days post vaccination, peptide-specific intracellular cytokine release of splenocytes was determined after stimulation with vaccinia epitope vp35#1 (vv), tyrosinase (tyr) or her-2/neu peptides (h2n). cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of peptide-specific, activated (cd62l low ) cd8 + t cells. the magnitude of the specifically induced t-cell response is depicted as the cells shifted to the lower right and indicated as a percentage (numbers in blue) of interferon-g-secreting cd8 + t cells within the cd8 + cell population. much previous research has been dedicated to the development of mva candidate recombinant vaccines against multiple virus infections of humans, including those causing aids, influenza, early childhood respiratory diseases, measles, japanese encephalitis or dengue fever (for a review see [2] ). as an effective vaccine against aids is urgently needed, recombinant mva producing immunodeficiency virus antigens are among the first vector viruses to be evaluated as candidate vaccines in humans [14 ,37] . substantial data from studies in different simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) or simian human immunodeficiency virus (shiv, a chimera of siv and hiv) infection models strongly support thorough clinical evaluation of mva-based vaccines. the use of heterologous primeboost strategies including mva vaccines and delivering multiple siv or hiv antigens proved successful to elicit antibody and high-level cytotoxic t-cell responses in macaques. the immune response effectively controlled a mucosal challenge with shiv 89.6p and sivmac251derived viruses or significantly reduced viral loads after challenge infection with neutralization-resistant and highly replication-competent sivmac239 [30, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . importantly, recent data suggest that siv/hiv-specific mucosal immunity can be boosted by peripheral mva immunization after oral priming with a salmonella vector vaccine [33] and intranasal inoculation of recombinant mva can stimulate immunodeficiency virus-specific immunity in the genital or rectal tract [35, 43] . elicitation of potent mucosal immunity and induction of broadly virus-neutralizing antibody responses are important milestones still to be reached for the derivation of a successful hiv vaccine. the principal capacity of mva to elicit highly effective virus-neutralizing antibody responses has been highlighted by the characterization of vector vac-cines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus and human cmv [25, 44 ] . the successful engineering of mva expressing sars coronavirus spike protein also demonstrated the suitability of the vector system to readily respond to the potential threat of rapidly emerging infectious diseases. a recently developed recombinant mva delivering multiple cmv antigens represents a promising candidate for the clinical testing of mva-based t-cell vaccines [25, 45 ,46] . this study also mirrors a general interest in the development of mva vector vaccines against human herpesvirus infections [47, 48] .the potential to activate robust cellular major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i-and ii-restricted cd8 + and cd4 + t-cell responses against recombinant antigens has made mva vaccines attractive for immunotherapeutic approaches against cancer and selected intracellular parasitic or bacterial infectious diseases. for experimental cancer therapy, virus-associated malignancies seem to be predestined targets for mva vaccines. taylor and coworkers [48] demonstrated the immunogenicity of an epstein-barr virus-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma vaccine by reactivating epstein-barr virus-specific cd8 + and cd4 + memory t cells in vitro. recently, corona gutierrez and colleagues [49 ] showed evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of an mva vaccine delivering human papillomavirus (hpv) e2 antigen against cervical cancer associated with hpv infection in a phase i/ii clinical trial. vaccines based on recombinant mva expressing different tumor-associated antigens specific for a variety of cancers are currently being tested in mice [27, 50, 51] and humans [52] . often these are combined with cytokines such as interleukin-2 [52] , costimulatory molecules such as b7-1 [27], measures to circumvent immune inhibitory signalling (by ctla-4 blockade) [51] or cellular adjuvants like dendritic cells [15] to enhance immune responses against antigens that are likely to be tolerogenic self-proteins.major efforts are underway to develop vaccines against malaria caused by plasmodium spp. parasites. preclinically, heterologous prime-boost immunization regimens have elicited strong cd8 + t-cell immunity and have shown substantial protection in mouse malaria challenge models against plasmodium berghei [28] or plasmodium yoelii [53] . in addition, safety and immunogenicity have been established in clinical trials with human volunteers, experimentally [13 ] or naturally exposed to plasmodium falciparum [54] . recently, the first prime-boost vaccinations against tuberculosis -combining dna [55] or the classical bacille calmette-gué rin vaccine [56] with recombinant mva expressing mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 85a -proved to be protective in mice.recombinant mva is a prime candidate poxvirus vector for a generation of new vaccines against infections and tumors. the portrait of the virus combines desirable elements such as high-level biological safety, the ability to activate appropriate innate immune mediators upon vaccination, and the capacity to deliver substantial amounts of heterologous antigens. the adoption of upto-date methodology for convenient vector generation, vector quality control, and vector vaccine immune monitoring has increased the pace of development, bringing recombinant mva vaccines into clinical trials. initial studies testing mva vaccines for prophylaxis or immunotherapy of aids, malaria, human papilloma virus-associated cancer or melanoma have already been completed (table 1) . first results are, overall, very encouraging and confirm clinical safety. importantly, however, they also demonstrate clinical efficacy, despite the intrinsic difficulties associated with these target diseases. renewed interest in the development of mva as candidate vaccine against an orthopoxvirus-related biothreat is likely to provide the basis for feasible large-scale manufacturing of mva vaccines. indeed, first studies suggest that mva would provide a suitable orthopox vaccine, if necessary. the use of recombinant mva to simultaneously provide immunity against smallpox has been proposed. nevertheless, one should keep in mind that hasty populationwide smallpox vaccinations might not be desirable, as high level antivector immunity could limit the future potential of poxvirus-based vector vaccines more urgently needed for prophylaxis or therapy of uncontrolled infectious diseases, cancer or emerging infections.recent data from a phase i clinical trial for treatment of metastatic melanoma indicated that vaccination with mva-transduced dendritic cells can in vivo activate t-cell responses directed against the recombinant antigen tyrosinase and against the recently identified epitope within vaccinia virus envelope antigen h3 [57 ,8 ] . immunogenicity of a highly attenuated mva smallpox vaccine and protection against monkeypox. nature 2004, 428:182-185. this study compares mva and standard dryvax vaccine in a monkeypox virus/macaque challenge model demonstrating similar immunogenicity and substantial protective capacity of mva vaccination. the work represents an important step in developing mva as second-generation smallpox vaccine. developing a safe and effective covid-19 vaccine is a global priority to end this pandemic. in their doseescalation, single-centre, open-label, phase 1 trial published in the lancet, feng-cai zhu and colleagues 1 report the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (ad5) vectored covid-19 vaccine, which expresses the full length spike glycoprotein of the wuhan-hu-1 strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). 108 healthy adults who had not been exposed to sars-cov-2, aged between 18 and 60 years (mean age 36·3 years, 49% female), were sequentially enrolled to receive the low, middle, or high dose of the vaccine, given as an intramuscular injection, and observed for 28 days. notably, high pre-existing ad5 neutralising antibody titres (>1:200, in 44-56% of participants) were shown to compromise seroconversion, and attenuate peak t-cell responses, although vector-related febrile reactions were less frequent. older participants (45-60 years) were found to have significantly lower humoral responses. this is one of the first-in-human trials of a covid-19 vaccine candidate showing immunogenicity.two key questions are whether responses are sustained over time and whether they correlate with clinical protection after exposure to a circulating strain of sars-cov-2. data from primate models suggest that measurable neutralising antibodies and specific t-cell responses could be associated with protection against virus challenge in vaccination or reinfection studies. 2, 3 further research, however, is necessary to evaluate safety, clinical efficacy, and duration of protection. a phase 2 study of this experimental vaccine (middle or low dose) has begun in china (nct04341389) and canada has approved an early phase human trial (nct04398147). other vaccine candidates are in rapid development. they are mostly based on the spike glycoprotein or its receptor binding domain because of better immunogenic and protective potential, but using different antigen delivery platforms (eg, recombinant protein or replicating or non-replicating viral-vector based vaccines, and dna or mrna vaccines); several are entering phase 1 clinical trials, or pending results. 4, 5 looking forward, other than immunogenicity, future trial design to establish efficacy will need to define the target groups (eg, health-care workers, individuals at high risk of severe illness), clinical endpoints (eg, reduction in virologically confirmed clinical illness, hospitalisations, deaths), optimal duration of observation (eg, virus exposure, side-effects, antibody titre change), and to anticipate antigenic change over time.results of this study indicate that some host factors might affect vaccine response. suboptimal immunogenicity was reported among older partici pants, echoing the challenge seen with influenza vaccination. further study in the older age group and the inclusion of individuals with underlying conditions are important, as they are at risk of severe disease and might benefit most from vaccine prevention. pre-existing immunity against the ad5 vector could compromise immunogenicity, potentially limiting effectiveness in populations in which the virus is endemic. the reported high seroprevalence (around 30-80%) in many countries had posed substantial challenges in vector-based vaccine development for other infections (eg, ebola virus, hiv). [6] [7] [8] whether using a rarer serotype or non-human primate adenovirus, adjuvants, booster or higher dose regimens, or other delivery platforms (eg, replication-defective vaccinia) could achieve greater degrees of immunogenicity is unknown and more research is needed. [4] [5] [6] another general concern is the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (eg, non-neutralising antibodies, fc γ-receptors) and increased cellular immunopathology (eg, t-helper-2 or t-helper-17 cell) in individuals who have been vaccinated if they are subsequently infected by a circulating sars-cov-2 strain, as suggested in preclinical studies of sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccines with whole-length spike glycoprotein (leading to research on a receptor binding domain-focused vaccine). [9] [10] [11] animal studies can be considered to assess the potential risk of sars-cov-2 vaccine candidates. 5 pre-existing, non-spike-specific t-cell responses from endemic human coronavirus exposure (eg, oc43, nl63) that cross-react with sars-cov-2 could further add to the complexity in predicting vaccine response and safety. 12, 13 these concerns will need to be addressed in future clinical studies with close monitoring and regulatory review. amid these uncertainties, this report of an immunogenic, tolerable vaccine candidate is encouraging at the starting line for covid-19 vaccine development. vaccine candidates shown to be efficacious will require substantial, well directed, and globally coordinated investments in production and delivery for their benefit to be realised. nl reports non-financial travel and meeting support from shionogi, consultancy fees and non-financial travel support from janssen pharmaceuticals, consultancy fees from hvivo, consultancy

declares no competing interests. middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) is a newly emerging acute respiratory system infectious disease, which is characterised by acute pneumonia, respiratory failure, and renal failure and caused by mers-coronavirus (mers-cov) [1, 2] . mers-cov was first isolated and identified in saudi arabia in 2012 as a new member in the lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus, and is a zoonotic virus that is transmitted from bats to camels, and then to humans [3, 4, 5] . the genome of mers-cov is a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded rna (ssrna) of approximately 30 kb encoding 11 proteins. they include two replicase polyproteins (open reading frames 1ab and 1a); four structural proteins including spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) proteins; and five nonstructural proteins (open reading frames 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b) [6] . mers-cov can be transmitted from person-to-person and has as high as 40% mortality [7] . as of june 26 2015, a total of 1356 cases including 484 related deaths have been reported to the world health organization [8] . no licensed vaccine or specific treatment is currently available.as one of the most effective strategies to prevent virus infection, vaccination is considered to be indispensable especially in the absence of effective treatment drugs. the continuous increase of patients and a high mortality rate of mers-cov infection highlight the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines development. the majority of recent progresses focused on the viral s glycoprotein and receptor-binding domain (rbd) of s protein [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , and showed that s protein-based or rbd-based subunit or vector vaccine that contain multiple neutralizing epitopes with high potentials to induce strong neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov infection; thus, it is considered to be a promising target for effective mers vaccine design [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . additionally, almazan et al. constructed a full-length infectious cdna clone of the mers--cov genome that lacked of e gene by reverse genetics approach to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates [20] . theoretically, nearly all viral proteins are potential immunogens and vaccine targets. thus, in addition to the s protein, other viral proteins of the mers-cov might be effective immunogen targets of mers vaccine. however, few studies have analyzed or tested the possibility of other viral proteins of mers-cov as vaccine targets. more importantly, t-cell-based cellular immunity is essential for cleaning mers-cov infection, yet the vaccine against the s protein mainly elicits neutralizing antibody response. further, the high mutation rate of the s protein may result in the escape of neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov. therefore, a highly conserved target that elicit both neutralizing antibody and cellular immunity against mers-cov is essential for an effective vaccine development.epitopes are also known as the antigenic determinant, which represents the minimal immunogenic region of a protein antigen and precisely elicit a specific immune responses [21] . numerous studies show that epitope-based vaccines could effectively elicit protective immune responses against diverse pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, hepatitis b virus, and hepatitis c virus [22] [23] [24] [25] . nevertheless, for emerging highly pathogenic pathogens, like mers-cov, h5n1, and h7n9, although their genome sequences are available in genbank database, their immunity associated with protection is currently largely unknown. these gaps in understanding immune protection make developing vaccines against these highly pathogenic viruses more difficult and challenging [26] . therefore, an immunoinformatics-driven approach to thoroughly screen the dominant immunogens based on available genome sequences data of pathogens is essential and promising for effective vaccine design of emerging infectious diseases [26] .in this study, based on newly available genome sequence data of mers-cov, numerous epitope vaccine candidates that could elicit protective humoral and cellular immune responses were obtained by immunoinformatics-driven vaccine target screening strategy. these results provided new vaccine epitope candidates for mers vaccine development, and indicated that immunoinformatic-driven immunogen screening is a promising strategy to accelerate vaccine development of the emerging highly pathogenic pathogens.the entire viral proteome sequences of all mers-cov isolates that include structural proteins spike protein (s), envelope protein (e), membrane protein (m), nucleocapsid protein (n), and non-structural proteins orf3, orf4a, orf4b, orf5 and orf8b, and two replicase polyproteins orf1ab and orf1a, were retrieved from the national center for biotechnology information database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and used as an input for various bioinformatics tools for antigenicity assessment, secondary structure and 3d model prediction, and epitope prediction. these sequences come from different geographic regions such as saudi arabia, england, qatar, spain, germany, jordan, and korea with time ranges from 2012 to 2015.antigenicity refers to the ability of antigen that can be recognized by the immune system. hence, to find the best potential candidate antigen, the vaxijen v2.0 server [27] (http://www. ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/vaxijen/vaxijen.html) was used for analyzing whole protein antigenicity and determined the most potent antigenic protein. the vaxijen is a web server, that was developed by dr. doytchinova ia and dr. flower dr, from faculty of pharmacy, medical university of sofia, for prediction of protective antigens, tumor antigens and subunit vaccines, with prediction accuracy of 70% to 89% for the discrimination between antigens and non-antigens [27] . in this study, virus was chosen as the target organism with default parameter. a single antigenic protein with the highest antigenicity score was selected as vaccine candidate for further analysis. antigenicity is closely related to the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein; hence, to determine the antigenicity and function of the target protein, the secondary structure of target protein that included solvent accessibility, transmembrane helices, globular regions, and coiled coil regions were predicted using the expasy's secondary structure prediction server protparam [28] (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/) and a self-optimized prediction method for alignment (sopma) [29] (https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl? page=/npsa/npsa_sopma.html) with default parameter. protparam is a tool which allows the computation of various parameters including the molecular weight, theoretical pi, amino acid composition, atomic composition, extinction coefficient, estimated half-life, instability index, aliphatic index and grand average of hydropathicity (gravy) for a given protein. the sopma method correctly predicts 69.5% of the secondary structure α-helix, β-sheet and coil [29] . the raptorx web server [30] (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/) was used to predict the threedimensional (3d) structure and binding residues of the chosen protein.the method of kolaskar and tongaonkar [31] at the immune epitope database (iedb) (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/bcell/) was applied to predict linear b-cell epitopes. the kolaskar and tongaonkar method has been applied to a large number of proteins to predict bcell epitopes by the developers. their results showed that the method can predict epitopes with about 75% accuracy; hence, it is better than most of the known methods [31] . further, the properties of the b-cell epitopes also include the flexibility, surface accessibility and hydrophilicity; hence, they were predicted by the karplus and schulz flexibility prediction [32] and emini surface accessibility prediction [33] with a threshold of 1.0 respectively, of the iedb. conformational b-cell epitopes were predicted by ellipro (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/ ellipro/) [34] with the minimum score value set at 0.7 while the maximum distance selected as 6 å. the ellipro allows the prediction and visualization of b-cell epitopes in a given protein sequence or structure. the test for ellipro on a benchmark dataset of discontinuous epitopes inferred from 3d structures of antibody-antigen complexes has shown the best performance compared with six other structure-based epitope prediction methods [34] .the netmhciipan 3.0 server [35] (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/netmhciipan/) was used to predict helper t-cell epitopes. threshold for strong binding peptides (ic 50 ) was set at 50 nm to determine the binding and interaction potentials of helper t-cell epitope peptide and major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii allele. the netmhciipan-3.0 is the first pan-specific helper t-cell epitope prediction method that covers all human leucocyte antigen (hla) class ii molecules including hla-dr, hla-dp, and hla-dq. it can predict peptide binding to any hla class ii molecule in a specified protein sequence [34] . the method was evaluated by the developers and shown a significant improvement over molecule-specific methods; hence, it is considered the most accurate mhc class ii predictor [36] . here, the top 10 epitopes with the maximum of binding hla-dr alleles were selected as putative epitope candidates.the cytotoxic t lymphocyte (ctl) epitope prediction was made using the iedb analysis resource netmhcpan (version 2.8) tool [37, 38] and the consensus tool [39] which combines predictions from ann aka netmhc (3.4) [40] [41] , smm [42] , and comblib [43] . the netmhcpan is a high-throughput computational method for genome-and hla-wide prediction of peptide binding to hla class i molecules, because it contains all hla class i alleles. hence, it can offer a truly global analysis for binding of the antigenetic peptide and hla molecule and promote rational vaccine design [37] . the netmhc is a prediction method with an average of 75-80% accuracy for peptides binding to hla class i molecules. it has been employed widely to predict hla-binding peptides in proteomes of various pathogens including sars, influenza and hiv [41] . the percentile rank threshold was set at 0.5. in this study, the top 10 epitopes with the maximum of binding hla-a alleles were selected as putative epitope vaccine candidates. further, except for a strong binding affinity, the peptides with strong immunogenicity are more likely to be ctl epitopes than those with weak immunogenicity. hence, the iedb immunogenicity prediction tool (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/ immunogenicity/) was used to predict the immunogenicity of the candidate epitopes [44] . this tool predicts immunogenicity of a peptide-hla (phla) complex based on the amino acid properties and their positions in the defined peptide.the epitope conservancy analysis tool (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/conservancy/ iedb_input) at the iedb was applied for the epitope conservancy analysis [45] . the conservancy levels were obtained by searching for identities in the given protein sequence. this tool calculates the degree of conservancy of an epitope within a given protein sequence set at different degrees of sequence identity. the degree of conservancy is defined as the fraction of protein sequences containing the epitope at a given identity level.the allergenicity of the epitopes was analyzed by the allerhunter server [46] (http://tiger.dbs. nus.edu.sg/allerhunter). allerhunter is a svm-pairwise system for assessment of allergenicity and allergic cross-reactivity in proteins. it aims to predict allergens and non-allergens with high sensitivity and specificity, without compromising efficiency at classification of proteins with similar sequences to known allergens [46] .due to the mhc restriction of t cell response, the peptides with more different hla binding specificities mean more population coverage in defined geographical regions where the peptide-based vaccine might be employed. the population coverage rate of individual epitope was calculated using the iedb population coverage tool (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/ population/iedb_input) [47] .every epitope and its binding hla alleles were added, and different geographic areas were also selected.the selection of immunogen is the first step for vaccine design; hence, to obtain the most probable antigenic protein, the whole viral proteomes of all mers-cov isolates were retrieved and screened. a total of 99 mers-cov variants from different geographical regions with their entire proteomes were obtained (s1 table) . the antigenicity of each protein is indicated by the overall score produced by the specific protein sequence using the vaxijen server. on the whole, the scores of the n protein and orf8b protein of mers-cov were higher than the s, e, m, orf3, orf4a, orf4b, orf5, orf1ab and orf1a proteins. moreover, the orf8b protein with its genbank id: ail23997.1 and the n protein with its genbank id: agv08499.1 possessed the significantly highest antigenic scores of 0.8218 and 0.7749, respectively, among all the query proteins (s1 table) . however, the orf8b protein would be rapidly degraded by proteasomes in the absence of the orf8a protein, an accessory protein of orf8b [48] . thus, it was not an ideal antigen candidate although its high antigenic score. in this study, the n protein was chosen as a candidate immunogen and model protein to carry out epitope-based vaccine design. further, the most probable antigenic protein was analyzed for its secondary structural characteristics, and the properties that included total length of 413 aa, molecular weight of 45048.2 da, theoretical pi of 10.05, formula of c 1965 h 3102 n 594 o 611 s 7 , 70 alpha helixes, 66 extended strands, 32 beta turns, and 245 random coils are obtained and shown in table 1 and fig 1. the grand average of the hydrophobicity rule (gravy) of the n protein linear sequence was predicted to be negative (-0.865). this indicated the property of the protein as hydrophilic in nature and most of the residues to be present on the surface. this means that more amino acids tend to be binding residues when interacted with other proteins. the 3d structure showed a maximum of 64% identity of the n protein of mers-cov with the best template protein pdb: 2ofza (rna binding domain of sars nucleocapsid protein), and it is composed of two separate domains or pockets (fig 2) . protein binding site prediction showed that a total of 12 binding residues including t40, v41, s42, y44, t45, g46, r97, y99, y101, r138, a145 and s173 were mapped on the domain-1. and only 2 binding residues including g267 and l268 were mapped on the domain-2. obviously, the domain-1 possessed the greater ability to interact with other proteins than the domain-2. this might be associated with distribution of the conformational epitopes on the n protein of mers-cov.one of the key steps in epitope-driven vaccine design is the prediction and identification of the b-cell epitopes in target antigens. thus, to obtain b-cell epitope candidates in the n protein of mers-cov, in silico identification of b-cell epitopes based on the iedb database was performed. based on the kolaskar and tongaonkar's method of the iedb, a total of 15 linear bcell epitopes of the n protein of mers-cov were identified. the length of the epitopes ranged from 6 to 20 amino acids. these epitopes had 78-91% conservancy level among the specified n protein sequences. notably, the epitopes 4 paapravsf 12 and 324 npvyflrysgaikl 337 were allergic to human; hence, they could not be vaccine candidates. epitopes' length, sequences, location, conservancy, and allergenicity are shown in table 2 . further, the results showed that the average antigenic prospensity value of the predicted epitopes was 0.993 with a minimum of 0.863 and a maximum of 1.182 (s1 fig). since surface accessibility and fragment flexibility are also key features for predicting b-cell epitopes. thus, the surface accessibility and flexibility were analyzed based on methods of the iedb. results of the analysis of the surface accessibility of the predicted peptides showed that the maximum surface probability value was 6.971 at amino acid position from 363 to 368. the sequence of the hexapeptide is 363 kkekkq 368 , where 365e is the surface residue. the minimum value of surface probability is 0.074 for peptides 205 gigavg 210 , where 207g is the surface residue (s2 fig). likewise, results of the analysis of the flexibility of the predicted peptides showed that the maximum flexibility value was 1.160 at amino acid position from 170 to 176, and its sequence is 167 gnsqsss 173 , where 170q is the flexible residue. the minimum value of flexibility probability is 0.903 for peptides 97 rwyfyyt 103 , where 100f is the flexibility residue (s3 fig). in addition, a total of 10 conformational b-cell epitopes having a protrusion index (pi) score value above 0.7 were obtained by the ellipro. the highest probability of a conformational epitope was calculated at 97.9% (pi score: 0.979) and shown in fig 3a. residues involved in conformational epitopes, their location, number of residues, and scores are shown in table 3 , whereas, their positions on 3d structures are shown in fig 3a to 3j .since mhc-ii restricted cd4 + t-cells activation is important for inducing and maintaining an efficient antibody response or ctl response, hence, the helper t-cell epitopes in the n protein of mers-cov were in silico identified. as a result, a total of 71 antigenic peptides with 9-mer core sequences in the n protein of mers-cov were identified to be helper t-cell epitopes using the netmhciipan 3.0 server (s2 table) . they can bind a different large number of hla-dr alleles with an ic 50 value less than 50nm, which indicated a very high binding affinity to hla-dr molecules. based on the fact that a good t-cell epitope should interact with as many hla alleles as possible, the top 10 epitopes with the highest number of binding hla-dr alleles were selected as putative helper t-cell epitope candidates ( table 4 ). all of the 10 putative helper t-cell epitopes with numerous binding hla-dr alleles tend to be good epitope candidates. among them, the epitope 329 lrysgaikl 337 interacting with 357 hla-dr alleles was the epitope possessing the maximum number of binding hla-dr alleles. on the contrary, 230 vkqsqpkvi 238 interacting with 94 hla-dr alleles is the epitope possessing the minimum number of binding hla-dr alleles. further, all selected putative epitopes were highly conserved with 89-91% conversancy level, and no epitope was found allergic to humans. details of predicted putative helper t-cell epitopes along with their respective binding hla-dr alleles are shown in s2 table. as we all know, mhc-i restricted cd8 + cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) plays a crucial role in controlling virus infection. hence, identification of ctl epitopes is vital for understanding the principles of t cell activation and epitope-driven vaccine design. herein, a total of 34 immunogenic peptides with 9-mer sequences in the n protein of mers-cov were identified to be ctl epitopes using the mhc-i binding predictions of the iedb with recommended methods (s3 table) . they can bind a different large number of hla-a alleles with a very high binding affinity. top 10 epitopes binding the most hla-a alleles were selected as putative ctl epitope candidates based on their more broad hla coverage (table 5 ). among them, the epitope 92 kqlaprwyf 100 had the highest number of binding hla-a alleles (138 alleles), followed by 343 nynkwlell 351 (128 alleles). yet, the epitopes 72 aqnagywrr 80 (37 alleles) and 387 rvqgsitqr 395 (31 alleles) had the minimum number of binding hla-a alleles. most ctl epitope candidates with a positive score of immunogenicity showed a high potential to elicit strong ctl response. further, these ctl epitope candidates were highly conserved with 85-91% conservancy level among available n protein sequences of mers-cov isolates, and no epitope was found allergic to humans. details of predicted putative ctl epitopes along with their respective binding hla-a alleles are shown in s3 table. population coverage of the epitopes hla distribution varies among different ethnic groups and geographic regions around the world. thus, population coverage must be taken into account when designing an effective vaccine to cover as much as possible populations. in this study, all indicated alleles in supplementary data were identified as optimum binders with the predicted epitopes and were used to determine the population coverage for these epitopes. the high population coverage was found for all putative helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes in 15 specified geographic regions of the world (table 6 ). for helper t-cell epitopes, an excellent percentage of cumulative population coverage of the 10 epitopes was obtained in south asia (98.68%), closely followed by cen- these results indicated only partial regions of the world, such as central africa and east asia, where approximately half of the population can be covered by all putative ctl epitopes. overall, these results suggested that putative helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes can specifically bind with the prevalent hla molecules in the target population where the vaccine will be employed. emerging infectious pathogens such as mers-cov, h5n1, and h7n9 are highly pathogenic for humans. for these pathogens, immunity associated with protection remain largely unknown. gaps in understanding the protective immunity against these pathogens make developing vaccines for newly emerging infectious diseases more difficult and challenging [26] . thus, the genome-wide screening of vaccine targets based on newly available genome sequences data of pathogens is essential and urgent for developing efficiently vaccines against these newly emerging highly pathogenic pathogens.this study aim to screen and investigate the most antigenic protein of the mers-cov and to find out the b-and t-cell epitopes that were mapped on the most antigenic protein by using a strategy namely genome-wide screening of vaccine epitopes. based on advances in bioinformatics, the immunoinformatics approach could be an effective and essential strategy for vaccine development of emerging highly pathogenic pathogens. in this study, an immunoinformatics-driven approach was used to screen vital dominant immunogens against mers-cov. the results showed that the n protein was a better antigenic protein with the highest antigenic scores compared with other viral proteins in entire viral proteome. however, nearly all current studies of mers vaccine focused on the s protein of mers-cov [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , because the s protein mediated recognition of host cell dpp4 receptor for mres-cov and induced significant immune response [49] . in fact, not just the s protein, other mers-cov viral proteins might be effective mers vaccine candidates. however, few studies have emphasized this possibility. further, t-cell-based cellular immunity is essential for cleaning mers--cov infection, yet the vaccine against the s protein mainly elicit neutralizing antibody response. more importantly, high mutation rate of the s protein of mers-cov may cause escape of neutralizing antibodies against s protein. therefore, an ideal target should be highly conserved that elicit both neutralizing antibody and cellular immunity against mers-cov, which is more essential for an effective mers vaccine development. the n protein of human cov is abundantly produced during infection and exhibits strong immunogenicity and conservancy, which can act as an ideal immunogen to elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses [50] . it is noteworthy that a large number of previous studies have shown the feasibility of the n protein as an immune target antigen or vaccine product [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . ma et al. demonstrated that a sars-cov vaccine based on the n gene that was expressed by dna plasmid and adenovirus vector could induce detectable antibody and ifn-γ [51] . similar studies of the dna vaccine based on the sars-cov n gene have shown potential inducing specific humoral and cellular immunity in balb/c mice [52, 53] . moreover, multiple immunodominant b-cell epitopes, helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes were mapped on the n protein of sars-cov [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . additionally, the antigenicity of the n protein from other viruses has been demonstrated [59, 60] . and the antibodies against the n proteins of diverse human covs have been revealed by gao et al. [61] . based on these findings, it concludes that the n protein of mers--cov might be a putative and valuable immunogen for vaccine development. further, the screened epitopes from the n protein in this study also may be some valuable epitope-based vaccine candidates for further in vitro and in vivo tests for their antigenic and immunogenetic potentials.the purpose of vaccination is to induce immunity against specific pathogens by selectively stimulating antigen-specific b-cells or ctls, and helper t-cells. theoretically, a vaccine should contain two classes of antigenic epitopes: a helper t-cell epitope and a b-cell epitope or a ctl epitope. based on a combination of these epitopes, the vaccine is able to either induce specific humoral or cellular immune against specific pathogens [21] . therefore, the b-cell, ctl, and helper t-cell epitopes were screened systemically in the n protein of mers-cov to obtain putative epitope vaccine candidates. in this study, one b-cell epitope, 108 eaalpfravkd-givwvhed 126 , showed a lower conservancy of 78% among different mers-cov isolates compared with other 14 epitopes, suggesting that it might be not an idea epitope candidate based on the fact that an epitope should be as conservative as possible to provide broader protection among different virus strains. in addition, various continuous and discontinuous b-cell epitopes were mapped on the n protein (table 2 and fig 3) . all discontinuous b-cell epitopes were located on the surface of the domain-2 of the n protein, showing the accessibility for the entered virus. moreover, the diverse t-cell epitopes including helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes were delineated by dissecting the n proteins (tables 4 and 5) . notably, neutralizing antibodies are not far enough to completely clean infectious pathogens. ctls are needed because they play a central role in the generation of a protective immune response against diverse pathogen infection [62] . in this study, although the ctl epitope 93 qlaprwyfy 101 showed the highest immunogenic score of 0.32573, it possessed the minimal hla binding alleles among all predicted ctl epitopes. on the contrary, the epitope 92 kqlaprwyf 100 had the maximum hla binding alleles, but less immunogenic score of 0.25847. this inconsistency of immunological characteristics among different epitopes suggested that various parameters needed to be considered when screened epitopes. helper t-cell epitopes are critical to the generation of vigorous humoral and ctl responses. however, the response to t-cell epitopes is restricted by hla proteins. moreover, hla is highly polymorphic in diverse ethnic populations. therefore, to induce broad immune responses in diverse ethnic genetically diverse human populations, the hla specificity of t-cell epitopes must be considered first as a major criteria for screening of the epitopes [63, 64] . based on the above analysis, to get more population coverage, the epitope candidates should bind more hla alleles. in this study, the 10 ten helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes that bind the maximum number of hla alleles were selected as putative vaccine candidates. further analysis revealed that all putative helper t-cell and ctl epitopes have an ideal population coverage and may provide broad immune protection for different geographic regions around the world. additionally, as an ideal epitope, it should be highly conserved among different mers-cov isolates. thus, conservancy level should be determined for all putative epitope candidates. the epitopes from this study were highly conserved in designated mers-cov isolates, suggesting that they could be ideal epitope vaccine candidates to elicit protective neutralizing antibodies and cellular immune responses against mers-cov.in conclusion, this study indicated that immunoinformatics-driven genome-wide screening of vaccine targets of emerging highly pathogenic pathogens is a promising strategy to accelerate their vaccine development. based on this strategy, the b-cell epitopes, helper t-cell epitopes and ctl epitopes in the n protein of mers-cov were mapped and selected as putative mers vaccine candidates. however, the b-and t-cell stimulation potentials of the screened epitopes are needed to be tested by in vitro and in vivo experiments along with this in silico study for their efficient use as vaccines against mers-cov. the present study provides new and valuable epitope candidates and prompts the future vaccine development of mers and other emerging infectious diseases. table. 9-mer peptide core sequences in the n protein of mers-cov are predicted to be helper t-cell epitopes using the netmhciipan 3.0 web server.

(mers-cov) was first identified in saudi arabia in 2012 [1] . soon after its first report, some imported cases occurred in many other countries outside the arabian peninsula through infected travelers, most notably the outbreak in south korea in 2015 [2] . the clinical signs of mers-cov-infected patients are similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), the outbreaks of which in china in 2003 caused acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans [3] . bats and dromedaries are considered as the natural reservoirs of mers-cov [3] . up to now, a continuous increase of human cases in the endemic areas has been reported [4] , highlighting that it is urgent to develop and make available effective therapeutic drugs and prophylactic vaccines to protect against mers-cov.to date, many promising approaches toward mers-cov vaccine candidates have been developed, such as recombinant viral vectors [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , protein-based platforms [11, 12] , bacterial-based platform [13] , and dna vaccines [14] [15] [16] . most of mers-cov vaccine candidates have focused on the major immune-dominant antigen, the s protein of the virion, which plays a significant role in mediating viral entry into target cells and in inducing neutralizing antibodies in experimental animals and infected individuals [17] . the receptor-binding domain (rbd) within the s1 domain of the s protein of the mers-cov virus decides the host range and cellular tropism [18] [19] [20] . as such, we developed two promising mers-cov vaccine candidates using two different platforms. one uses the rabies virus (rv) as a vector to express s1 domains of the mers-cov s gene to develop a recombinant mers-cov vaccine, and the other applies gram-positive enhancer matrix (gem) particles as a vector to construct a mers bacterium (lactococcus lactis)-like particle (blp) vaccine by displaying the rbd [13] . a previous study has utilized the rv (bnsp333) vector modified from the rv vaccine vector spbn to successfully design a vaccine against mers-cov infection [10, 21] , whereas the rv vector (srv9 strain) used in our study is screened from the street alabama dufferin (sad) strain by plaque purification on baby syrian hamster kidney cells (bhk-21) cells, which have been proven to be safe and have good immunogenicity [22] . the gem-pa system is a novel surface display system consisting of nonliving and genetically unmodified gem particles and a protein anchor (pa) from the lactococcus lactis peptidoglycan hydrolase acma. we utilized the system to successfully display the rbd protein fragment of mers-cov, inducing high neutralizing antibodies with intramuscular vaccination and robust antigen-specific local and systemic immune responses by intranasal vaccination [13] . the head-to-head comparison of available vaccine vectors is necessary in vaccine design [23] . the difference in immune response induced by two different mers-cov vaccine candidates and the effect of antigen displayed in viral and bacterial vectors on the immune response are still questionable.in this study, we evaluated the immunological efficacy of mers blp at different doses and the inactivated recombinant mers antigen in babl/c mice. specifically, we compared the ability of these two vaccines to induce mers-cov-specific humoral immune response and t-cell-mediated immune response, as well as neutralizing antibodies against mers-cov.all animal works were strictly in accordance with the welfare and ethical guidance on chinese laboratory animals (gb 14925-2001). the agreement was approved by the animal welfare and ethics committee of the institute of veterinary medicine of the changchun veterinary research institute (laboratory animal care and use committee authorization, permit number jsy-dw-2019-05).baby syrian hamster kidney (bhk-21) cells were cultured in serum-free medium (viruspro ® , shanghai, china) at 37 • c with 5% co 2 on an orbital shaker at 130 rpm in suspension culture for virus infection. mouse neuroblastoma (na) cells were cultured with dulbecco's modified eagle medium (dmem, thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma, usa) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs, biological industries, kibbutz beit haemek, israel) for determination of viral titer and verification of virus inactivation. spodoptera frugiperda 9 (sf9, gibco, grand island, ny, usa) insect cells were grown in sf-900tm ii medium (life technologies, san diego, ca, usa) for protein expression. the recombinant rv expressing mers-cov s1 protein (rv/mers) was constructed and stored in our laboratory.the rv/mers virus was cultivated in bhk-21 cells. briefly, bhk-21 cells (2 × 10 6 cells per ml) grown in shake flask cultures were infected with rv/mers virus at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.05. rv/mers was harvested from the culture supernatant of cell culture on two days post-infection (dpi). the titers of the recombinant virus were determined by the median endpoint of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose units (tcid 50 ) in na cells as described previously [24] . recombinant virus was inactivated with 0.025% β-propiolactone (v/v); the mixtures were incubated at 4 • c overnight and then treated at 37 • c for 2 h. the verification of the virus' complete inactivation was detected in na cells. the completely inactivated virus was purified with 500kd hollow fiber ultrafiltration column and sepharose fast flow 4 gel. fractions were harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting. the total protein concentration of the purified product was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (bca) protein assay.the mers blp was produced as previously described [13] . briefly, the fusion protein of rbd-linker-pa3 was expressed in a baculovirus expression system. the gem particles were used as vectors to construct mers blp by externally displaying the rbd through the pa3. the fusion protein concentration of the mers blp was detected densitometrically using quantity one image analysis software, version 4.6.7.the size (hydrodynamic diameter, in nm) and size distribution (polydispersity index, pdi) of the rv/mers and mers blp were determined using a laser particle size analyzer (nano zs90, malvern instruments, worcestershire, uk), which the fresh prepared rv/mers and mers blp suspension were determined under almost the same humidity and temperature at 25 • c, and each sample measurement was performed in triplicate simultaneously.four-to six-week-old female balb/c mice were purchased from changchun yisi laboratory animal technology co., ltd. (changchun, china). female balb/c mice were randomized into five groups of 10. mice were intramuscularly prime-immunized with 8 µg purified rv/mers virus; 1, 5, and 20 µg mers blp; mixed with the compound adjuvants consisting of isa201vg (seppic, paris, france) and poly i: c (sigma, st. louis, mo, usa); and boosted twice with an equal volume antigen as the primary vaccination at 3-week intervals. compound adjuvants only were immunized as negative control. blood samples were collected before immunization and two weeks after each vaccination. serum samples were inactivated at 56 • c for 30 min before determining mers-cov rbd-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. five mice selected randomly from each group were euthanized on day 7 after the third immunization, and their splenocytes were collected for cytokines analysis.enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) was applied to analyze mers-cov rbd-specific igg, igg1, igg2a, igg2b, igg2c, and igg3 antibodies. serially diluted sera were added to 96-well microtiter plates (corning-costar, corning, ny, usa) that were pre-coated overnight with mers-rbd protein (1 µg/ml) produced in escherichia coli. the plates were incubated at 37 • c for 1 h and washed three times with pbst before being incubated with the following horseradish peroxidase (hrp) labeled anti-mouse igg (1:5000, bioworld, st. louis, mn, usa), igg1, igg2a, igg2b, igg2c, and igg3 (1:2000, southern biotech, birmingham, al, usa) at 37 • c for 1 h. plates were then washed three times, and 100 µl tmb (3 ,3 ,5 ,5 -tetramethylbenzidine) per well was added. then, the color development was stopped by adding h 2 so 4 . optical density values were read at 450 nm using an elisa plate reader (bio-rad, hercules, ca, usa).neutralizing titers of mice sera were detected by using a mers-cov pseudovirus reported in our previous study [11] . briefly, serially diluted mouse sera mixed with an equal volume of 100× tcid 50 of mers-pseudotyped viruses were incubated at 37 • c for 30 min, and then, the mixture was incubated with huh 7 cells at 37 • c for 4 h. after the incubation, the medium was replaced with complete dmem containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and then, the samples were incubated at 37 • c for 48 h. the luciferase activity was detected by using an infinite m200 microplate spectrophotometer (tecan, männedorf, switzerland).to evaluate antigen-specific t-cell responses, splenocytes were harvested on day 7 after the third immunization and stimulated with 1 µm mers-cov peptide s291 for 24 h at 37 • c [25] . secreted tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α), interferon-gamma (ifn-γ), and interleukin 2 (il-2) in the supernatants were detected with the mouse elisa cytokine kits (mabtech, nacka, sweden).all statistical analysis was performed by using the graphpad 8.0.2 software. the results are expressed as the mean ± sd, and significance in their differences between groups were analyzed using a student's t-test.the particle size and polydispersity index of rv/mers and mers blp were measured by a dynamic light scattering (dls) device before immunization of mice. as shown in figure 1 to compare the immunological efficacy of two mers-cov vaccines derived from two different vectors, we studied the impact on the immunogenicity of mers-cov blp with different doses and the immunogenicity of rv/mers with only one certain dose in mice. the schematic diagram for group design, immunizations, and immunological characterization is shown in figure 2a . a total of five groups of mice (g1-g5) were administered three immunizations with a combined adjuvant through an intramuscular (i.m.) route; g1 was immunized with pbs as negative control; g2 was immunized with 8 µg inactivated and purified rv/mers; g3-g5 were immunized with 1 µg (low dose), 5 µg (medium dose), and 20 µg (high dose) mers-cov blp, respectively. sequential sera samples were collected at weeks 0, 2, 5, and 8 and detected for neutralizing activity against pseudotyped mers-cov and the binding activity. splenocytes were harvested at 7 weeks after the last immunization for cytokines analysis. as shown in figure 2b , g2 developed neutralizing antibody response at 2 weeks after the first immunization, and the neutralizing antibodies of g3, g4, and g5 were not detected at this point. however, the neutralizing antibody of g3, g4, and g5 was significantly higher than g2 at 5 and 8 weeks after immunization. there were also no significant differences in the neutralizing activity among g3, g4, and g5, indicating that 1 µg mers-cov blp can efficiently induce mers-cov neutralizing antibodies in mice. overall, these results show that the rv/mers can rapidly induce neutralizing antibody response, and the mers blp can induce higher antibody response in mice. a total of five groups of mice were immunized and detected for virus-neutralizing antibody, igg subtypes, and cytokines release. group 1 (g1) was negative controls; group 2 (g2) was vaccinated with inactivated and purified rabies virus (rv)/middle east respiratory syndrome (mers); group 3, group 4, and group 5 (g3, g4, g5) were vaccinated with varying doses of the mers bacterium (lactococcus lactis)-like particle (blp). all groups received a second and third identical vaccination boost with a combined adjuvant at 3-week intervals after the primary immunization. (b) neutralizing activity was detected by using mers coronavirus (mers-cov) pseudovirus, and the data are shown as the mean ± sd from five mice in each group and were analyzed by student's t-test (* p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001, **** p < 0.0001, n = 5).we next detected the mers-cov rbd-specific igg and igg subtypes' antibodies level in the serum at 8 weeks post-immunization. elisa results indicate that both mers antigen-induced igg antibodies can specifically bind to mers-cov rbd protein. particularly, g3-g5 acquired a stronger binding to mers-cov rbd protein than g2, whereas g1, the control samples, were detected to have negligible binding activity (figure 3a) , indicating the specificity of the igg antibody response induced by this rbd protein. additionally, the endpoint titers of the igg antibody level showed that the immunogenicity of g3-g5 was much stronger than g2 in inducing mers-cov rbd-specific igg antibody response in mice after three vaccinations (figure 3b) . furthermore, no significant difference was shown for igg titers among groups g3, g4, and g5, suggesting that 1 µg antigen protein on the bacterial vector is sufficient to induce high rbd-specific antibody level in mice. thus, the mers-cov antigen protein displayed on the surface of the bacterial vector can significantly enhance the immunogenicity of the rbd fragments. t helper 2 (th2) response is associated with igg1, and t helper 1 (th1) response correlates with igg2a, igg2b, igg2c, and igg3 in mice [26] . in order to evaluate the igg subtypes' levels in serum from immunized mice, the production of igg1, igg2a, igg2b, igg2c, and igg3 in sera were detected. observation of sera igg subtypes showed that the sera in g3-g5 induced significantly higher levels of igg1 antibody than those of g2 ( figure 4a) ; the sera in g4-g5 induced significantly higher levels of igg2a and igg2b antibodies than those of g2 (figure 4b,c) ; there was no significant difference in igg2c antibody level between g2-g5 ( figure 4d) ; the sera in g5 induced significantly higher levels of igg3 antibody than those of g2 (figure 4e ). however, further analysis of the ratios of igg2a/igg1 revealed that the sera in g2 were remarkably higher than those in g3-g5 (figure 4f) . collectively, these results suggest that the mers-cov antigen protein displayed on the surface of the viral vector appears to induce a stronger th1-biased immune response than that on the bacterial vector. next, in order to analyze the mers-cov specific t-cell immune responses, we detected the levels of secreted ifn-γ, il-2, and tnf-α from the splenocytes after re-stimulation with mers s291 peptide. the levels of ifn-γ and il-2 in g3 were significantly higher than those in g4 and g5, suggesting that 1 µg of antigen protein on the bacterial vector is sufficient to induce potent ifn-γ/il-2-expressing t-cell responses, whereas the levels of ifn-γ, il-2, and tnf-α in g2 were remarkably higher than those in g3-g5 at 7 weeks post-immunization (w.p.i.) ( figure 5 ). these results indicate that mers-cov antigen protein displayed on the viral vector induces a superior cellular immune response than that on the bacterial vector. figure 5 . immunization induced a significant cytokine response in mice. in order to evaluate antigen-specific t-cell responses, splenocytes were harvested from five mice in each group and were stimulated by mers-cov peptide s291 for 24 h. the level of secreted ifn-γ (a), il-2 (b), and tnf-α (c) in the supernatants was detected by mouse elisa kits. the data are shown as the mean ± sd and were analyzed by student's t-test (* p < 0.05, **** p < 0.0001, n = 5).mers-cov continues to infect humans, causing morbidity and mortality since several outbreaks in 2012 that have caused a potential global mers-cov pandemic. however, no prophylactics and therapeutics available to protect against mers have currently been licensed, although researchers have developed and tested several mers-cov vaccine candidates in many animal models. each of these candidate vaccines has several advantages and challenges, such as preexisting immunity, immunogenicity, and cost-effectiveness. here, we have developed two promising mers-cov vaccine candidates using two different platforms. one is the recombinant rv expressing mers-cov s1 protein fragment, and the other uses gem particles as a vector to display the mers-cov rbd protein fragment. in this study, we compared the humoral and cellular responses in a balb/c mouse model. the results indicate that the rv/mers vaccine induces rapidly neutralizing antibody and stronger t-cell immune responses than the mers-cov blp vaccine. however, the mers-cov blp vaccine can induce a higher level of neutralizing antibodies than that of the rv/mers vaccine.two unique aspects can be highlighted in our study. the first is about the rv vector, besides the mers-cov, which has been proven to be successfully utilized for many other emergent infectious diseases, such as the ebola virus (ebov) [27] , lassa virus (lasv) [28] , marburg virus (marv) [29] , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) [30] , and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv) [31] . additionally, the ebola virus vaccine is close to clinical trials [29] . notably, chemically inactivated rabies virus vaccines have been widely used for vaccination of humans, dogs, cats, and ferrets, which shows that they are safe for humans and animals [32] . therefore, the inactivated rabies virus-based vaccine is also safe and can induce neutralizing antibodies against the target pathogen. here, the results show that the inactivated rabies virus vectors have very safe and immunogenic profiles in animals and highlight their promise for vaccine development.the second unique aspect of this study is the gem-pa system, a novel surface display system, which is a flexible, effective, cost-effective, and easy-to-handle alternative for heterologous proteins to be displayed on the gem particles [33] . the gem particles are from the lactococcus lactis boiled in acids and mainly contain the bacterial-shaped peptidoglycan spheres, lacking other cell components [34] . additionally, lactococcus lactis has been safely applied in foods in recent years [35] . as such, the gem-based vaccine is recognized as being safe. furthermore, the gem particles have been proven to enhance immune response as a carrier displaying the antigen with high density or adjuvant in vaccine development [36] [37] [38] [39] . gem particles can also improve the humoral and cellular immune response by activating the maturation of the dendritic cells, enhancing the antigen-presenting capacity, and stimulating the dcs to produce cytokines [40] . besides that, peptidoglycan, the main component of the gem particles, is a toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 ligand [38, 40, 41] . moreover, gem particles can efficiently bind the antigen protein at room temperature to obtain the purified proteins with only a one-step centrifugation process [33] . it is convenient and economical to scale up in vaccine development. gem particles can also bind to different antigen proteins in the same particles to develop multivalent vaccines [42] . the system has successfully displayed a variety of heterologous proteins from pathogens, showing strong antigen-specific immune responses with parenteral vaccination or mucosal vaccination, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites [38, [43] [44] [45] [46] . in our study, the results suggest that the rbd protein of mers-cov displayed on the gem particles could induce strong humoral and cellular immune response even when the dose is as low as 1 µg.the two vaccine platforms in this study have their own advantages and disadvantages. the rv-based mers-cov vaccine platform can rapidly induce antibody immune response and higher cellular immune response than the gem-based vaccine platform. however, there is a risk of incomplete inactivation in the process of inactivating the rv/mers. additionally, rv/mers vaccine needs to be purified through many purification steps. these factors must be considered in vaccine production. antigen protein density and distribution on a particle are two key parameters in eliciting an efficient immune response in vaccine design; a high density and ordered antigenic array displayed on a particle makes binding events between the host b-cell surface immunoglobulins and the particle occur more easily, which is an important step in inducing sequential immune response [47] . the gem-based vaccine platform could display antigen protein in a high density, while the rv-based vaccine platform not only displayed the antigen protein but also expressed the rv gp protein. this may be why the gem-based vaccine of mers-cov induces a much stronger humoral immune response in mice than that of the rv-based vaccine. micro-particles could promote a humoral immune response, and nano-particles are much easier to induce a cellular immune response [48, 49] . the size of the rv/mers virion is about 167 nm, and the diameter of the mers blp particles is about 2161 nm. this may be a critical factor in inducing a different cellular immune response by two different vectors of vaccine platforms. specific molecules of microbial origin, as intrinsic innate immune triggers, are endowed with adjuvant activity, such as lipopolysaccharide (lps), bacterial lipopeptides, deoxyribonucleic acid (dna), ribonucleic acid (rna), and other conserved molecules [50] . the receptors for these molecules are the mammalian toll-like receptors (tlrs). members of the tlrs have been confirmed on the cell surface membrane (tlr1/2/4/5/6/10) and on the membrane of endosomes (tlr3/7/8/9) [51] . peptidoglycan, the main component of the gem particles, is a tlr 2 ligand which is an activation of tlr-2 receptors in human peripheralblood mononuclear cells inducing a th1-type immune response [52] . single stranded rna, the component of inactivated rabies virus, is a tlr 7 ligand [51, 53] . tlr7/8 agonists have shown th1 polarizing effects on the immune response. different receptors play an important role in delivering different signals to the host cells. the activated antigen presenting cells (apcs) precisely define the nature of the perceived danger and send this information to the secondary lymphoid organs, inducing relevant adaptive immune response. this may be another ignored factor of inducing a different immune response by the immune system thinking that the danger is from a virus infection or a bacterial infection. the immune system is triggered by a combination of events and stimuli in vaccine immunology. the compound adjuvants containing the emulsion and polyi:c (tlr 3 ligand) may be another assignable cause. the speed of the antibodies' production and cellular immune response needs to be further improved in future study of the gem-based vaccine platform. to solve the problems, we can try to screen optimum adjuvants for the vaccine or co-displaying protein-adjuvants on gem particles, such as flagellin (tlr 5 ligand). furthermore, the gem-based vaccine platform may be more suitable to develop mucosal vaccines considering that lactococcus lactis has been safely used as a probiotic in our foods. understanding the modes of action of the gem-based vaccine platform will allow us to design a much safer, cost-effective, and protective vaccine with the desired immune response.the goal of this study was to test vaccine vectors through a head-to-head comparison of immunogenicity of two mers-cov vaccine candidates as they might be used in real vaccines for humans or animals. this study provides an important reference for selecting a suitable vaccine platform in developing the mers-cov vaccine or other special pathogens in further study.volunteers were admitted to the clinical trial ward the evening before the vaccination. an extensive series of laboratory safety tests was performed. volunteers were vaccinated in the morning and were monitored regularly for at least 24 hours after the administration of the vaccine before they were released. temperature, blood pressure and heart rate were documented 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours after each vaccination. the volunteers documented all solicited and unsolicited adverse events in a diary up to study day 56. body temperature was assessed orally daily on days 1-14 and 29-42 (in the evenings). the diary was written on days 3, 7, 14, 28, 29, 35, 42 and 56. laboratory safety tests were assessed during ambulatory visits on days 3, 7, 14, 28, 29, 35, 42 and included a full blood count, electrolytes, 70 liver and renal function tests, c-reactive protein and troponin t measurements.adverse events were assessed and categorized based on whether they were solicited (expected and therefore predefined in the study protocol) or unsolicited events. data on solicited adverse events were collected for 14 days after each injection. solicited events included both local (pain, induration, erythema/redness, hematoma, and swelling at injection site) and systemic adverse events; namely fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, loose stool, abdominal cramps, and nausea). unsolicited adverse events were all other events not listed above and all events that arose between days 14 and 28 as well as after day 42 (14 days after the booster vaccination). the occurrence of serious adverse events (sae) was monitored throughout the study. an sae was defined as any event that results in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient 80 hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent disability or required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. adverse events were listed and graded for each participant according to the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (meddra: ae grade 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). the severity of adverse events was assessed using the common toxicity criteria (ctcae version 4) and the fda's 2007 voluntary guidance and is defined in the study protocol. in general, adverse events were considered as mild if the event did not interfere with activities of daily living, as moderate when they interfered with daily living activities, but did not pose significant or permanent risks to the participants, while severe adverse events significantly affected daily living and clinical status.blood pressure levels and pulse rate were assessed at the same time points as the temperature measurements. vital 90 signs remained stable with no significant changes (data not shown).mers-cov-s-specific antibodies in the sera of vaccinated individuals were quantified using an in-house s1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) according to a previously validated protocol. 1 briefly, 96-well microtiter elisa plates were coated overnight with 1 μg/ml mers-cov s1 protein. the plates were blocked for 1h followed by addition of sera (diluted 1:100). following a 1h incubation, plates were washed and bound antibodies were detected using hrp-labelled rabbit anti-human igg (dako). the signal was developed using 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (tmb, thermofisher scientific) as a substrate and the reaction was stopped by 0·5n sulfuric acid. the absorbance of each sample was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (infinite f200, tecan). a cut-off was set at an optical density (od) value of 0·5 (od450).the anti-mers-coronavirus elisa (igg) was purchased from euroimmun ag, lübeck (order number ei 2604-9601 g). human serum samples were analyzed according to the working instruction of the kit using the bep ® (behring elisa prozessor) iii system. in brief, human sera were diluted 1:101 in sample buffer, and allowed to react with mers-cov s1 antigen for 30 minutes. after three washes with washing buffer, anti-human-igg coupled to peroxidase was used for detection (30 min of incubation). substrate solution was added to each well after another wash and allowed to react for 15 min, before the reaction was stopped. the od was determined at 450 nm -650 nm.samples were analysed in duplicates. quantification of the results was performed using serially diluted human monoclonal anti-mers-cov spike (s) antibody (m336), 2 which was analysed on every plate. the final concentrations of the standards were: s1 = 250 ng/ml; s2 = 125 ng/ml; s3 = 62·5 ng/ml; s4 = 31·25 ng/ml; s5 = 15·63 ng/ml; s6 = 7·8 ng/ml. od values of the standards, controls and test samples were transferred to graphpad prism 7.03 software to calculate the dose response curve using four-parameter logistic curve fitting. the cut-off was determined by the minimum asymptote of the dose response curve. results are shown in figure s2 . as shown in figure s3 , results from the in-house elisa correlated well with the euroimmun elisa.presence of mers-cov-neutralizing antibodies in sera of vaccinees was investigated according to previously published protocols. 3,4 briefly, complement inactivation of serum samples was carried out at 56°c for 30 min. afterwards, sera were serially diluted in 96-well plates, starting from a 1:8 dilution. sera were incubated for 1 h at 37°c together with mers-cov (emc/2012 isolate; 50% tissue culture infective doses (tcid50) using huh-7 cells). cytopathic effect (cpe) was analyzed 4 days post-infection. neutralization was defined as absence of cpe compared to virus controls. a human monoclonal antibody served as a neutralization control. 2 for each test, a positive control (neutralizing antibody m336) is used in duplicates as an inter-assay control. results (neutralization vs. cpe) are checked by dual-control principle. neutralization titers were calculated as reciprocal values of geometric mean titers of four replicates. a titer of 8 was considered positive.sera were tested for the presence of mers-cov-neutralizing antibodies using a plaque reduction neutralization assay (prnt) as previously described with minor modifications. 1 heat-inactivated serum samples were serially diluted two-fold (starting at 1:10), mixed 1:1 with 400 pfu of mers-cov (emc/2012) and incubated for 1 hours.the mix was then overlayed on a monolayer of huh-7 cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 1h. the mix was subsequently removed and cells were further incubated for 8 hours to allow for one replication cycle of the virus to occur following cell infection. cells were then fixed and stained using an anti-mers-cov-n protein mouse monoclonal antibody (sino biological) and a secondary peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse igg1 (southernbiotech). the signal was developed using a precipitate-forming tmb substrate (true blue, kpl). the number of infected cells per well was counted using the immunospot® image analyzer (ctl europe gmbh). the neutralization titer of each serum sample was determined as the reciprocal value of the highest dilution resulting in an at least 80% reduction in the number of infected cells (prnt80). a titer of ≥ 20 was considered to be positive.peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated and cryopreserved from edta-blood using ficoll density gradient centrifugation. interferon-γ (ifn-γ) secretion was analyzed using a ctl human ifn-γ single color 384-well enzyme-linked immuno spot assay (elispot, immunospot®). following thawing and overnight resting, 5x10 5 pbmcs were plated in each well and incubated in serum-free medium (ctl medium, immunospot ® ) for 16h at 37°c and 9% co2 with overlapping peptide pools (olps) spanning the entire amino acid sequence of mers-cov s protein (final concentration: 1 µg/ml). while incubation with phytohemagglutinin (pha) and a cef pool (cmv, ebv, influenza peptide pool; jpt peptide technologies) served as positive controls, negative controls were incubated with ctl medium plus dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) at the same concentration used for the reconstitution of the mers-s peptide pools. spot detection, elispot image acquisition and analyses were performed using aid elispot robotic system (aid gmbh, germany). spot forming cells (sfc) were calculated using the geometric mean of triplicates. dmso controls were used to normalize the data. a positive response was defined using two criteria: first, a response >50 sfc per 1 m pbmcs and secondly, a four-fold value over the baseline (day 0). ifn-γ-elispot assays were performed with pbmcs isolated at days 0, 28, 35, 42, 56, 84 and 180 post vaccination. 150antigen-specific t-cells were analyzed using cryopreserved pbmcs. following overnight resting, pbmcs were incubated for 6h at 37°c with overlapping peptide pools (olps) spanning the aa sequence of mers-cov-s in the presence of cd28/cd49d, (bd bioscience) golgistop (biolegend) and golgiplug (sigma). negative controls were treated with dmso at the same concentration as cells stimulated with olps. pma and cef served as positive controls. we used following antibodies to evaluate the cd4 + ifnγ + and cd8 + ifnγ + expression: zombie aqua (biolegend), cd4 af700, cd8 apc-cy7, cd3 buv395, ifnγ pe-cy7. cells were analyzed on an lsrfortessa (bd bioscience) and evaluated with flowjo10. gating strategy and corresponding antibody-panels are depicted in the figure s5 .the "subject pool" mentioned in the study protocol (page 22) refers to the cro's database of individuals who have been contacted before. since the individuals included in the "subject pool" of the cro were also recruited through public advertisement, all participants in this study were recruited via public advertisement. for this study specifically, advertisement was placed online (google, facebook, ebay) and on local subway trains. a financial reimbursement of 1,050€ for participants was offered for completion of the study. 63 participants were assessed for eligibility. of these, 30 were ineligible since they did not meet in-/ exclusion-criteria at screening or day -1. reasons for screening failure are given in table s1 . of the 33 eligible individuals screened, 26 were enrolled into the study as participants.since the cohort size was pre-defined, seven individuals who were eligible were not included as study participants.six healthy controls were recruited in the same period as ld and hd subjects. three individuals (1x10 7 pfu: n=2; 1x10 8 pfu: n=1) did not receive the booster immunization and were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. in the ld cohort (1x10 7 pfu) two participants discontinued due to personal reasons within the first 14 days (on february 14 and april 13, 2018) and were replaced. both replacements completed followup visits and were included in the analyses. in the hd cohort (1x10 8 pfu) one participant received no boost immunization due to an unrelated urinary tract infection on day 27 (july 02, 2018) and dropped out. at this late timepoint in the study, the drop-out was not replaced to avoid a substantial increase in the overall study duration. using the mann-whitney-u test a p-value of 0·0022 was calculated. since day 3 after the booster vaccination (day 31) was not a study visit, potential changes on that day, especially changes in wbc, neutrophils and crp, could not be observed.all other parameters including electrolytes, liver and kidney parameters, bilirubin, albumin, glucose, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), troponin t (tnt) and creatinkinase (ck) remained largely within normal limits after vaccination. all haematological and other laboratory changes were transient and returned to normal levels within days.significance levels were calculated using wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired and mann-whitney-u test for unpaired samples.in the hd cohort, a significant rise in oral temperature could be observed 12 hours after prime and booster vaccinations ( figure s1b & c) . a difference was also be observed in oral temperatures of patients between the ld and hd cohort 12 hours after prime and booster vaccination (gm . it should be noted that the temperature stayed within normal limits and none of the volunteers in the ld developed fever, except for two participants in the hd cohort.one vaccinee had elevated temperature (37·8°c), and one experienced fever (38·8°c). both events occurred about 16h post prime vaccination.significance levels were calculated using wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired and mann-whitney-u test for unpaired samples. hemoglobin and leucocytes too low

surveillance by who, and, in 2015, it was placed on the list of priority diseases with high epidemic potential that warrant urgent research and development of countermeasures. 1 as a disease of the lower respiratory tract in humans, mers can progress rapidly from unspecific, influenza-like symptoms to severe pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.the causative agent of mers is mers coronavirus (mers-cov), which was first identified in 2012 in saudi arabia. 2 dromedary camels serve as reservoir hosts, and the majority of primary human cases can be traced back to close or frequent contact with dromedaries. additionally, human-to-human transmission is amplified in health-care settings, adding health-care workers to the populations at high risk.as of jan 31, 2020, 2519 cases have been reported, with 866 deaths in 27 countries, resulting in a casefatality rate of 34·3%. 3 large mers outbreaks occurred in saudi arabia in 2014 (255 cases and 93 deaths) 4 and in south korea in 2015 (186 cases and 38 deaths). 5 although transmission is predominantly reported from the arabian peninsula, there is a high risk of exporting cases to areas outside the middle east as a result of travel. so far, supportive therapy, isolation of patients, and contact tracing remain the main pillars of mers treatment and prevention, highlighting the urgent need to develop countermeasures such as vaccines to block transmission and combat potential future disease outbreaks.the development of mers vaccine candidates has been challenging because the determinants of protective immunity remain incompletely understood and the limited number of mers cases has made it difficult to do efficacy trials. although optimal animal models for the identification of protective immune correlates for mers are still scarce, current mouse models suggest a crucial role for antibodies and t cells in the induction of protective immunity. [6] [7] [8] in humans, one study showed a positive correlation of cd4 t-cell responses and neutralising antibodies with severe disease progression, and a positive correlation of strong virus-specific cd8 t-cell responses with reduced mor bidity; 9 conversely, another study reported a positive association between early cd8 t-cell responses and disease severity in acute mers-cov infection. 10 a role of antibodies in protection was shown in mice that received convalescent sera from survivors. 9 the animal and human data underline that a mers vaccine candidate should preferentially induce humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and that the timing and dose of a vaccine could be crucial for protection.in this study, we used the recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara (rmva) vaccine vector platform, which has been shown to be safe and immuno genic in humans. 11 mva vaccine candidates have demon strated a favourable safety profile in various populations and disease settings. [11] [12] [13] the mers-cov spike glycoprotein consists of s1 and s2 subunits and mediates viral attachment to host cells, entry, and membrane fusion. 14 it is a target for neutralising antibodies and, therefore, vaccine development. theevidence before this study middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) is a zoonotic viral respiratory illness caused by the mers coronavirus (mers-cov). mers is under active surveillance scrutiny by who, and so far there is no licensed vaccine available to prevent disease and viral spread. mva-mers-s, a novel vaccine candidate based on the recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) vaccine vector platform, has been reported to be safe and immunogenic in mice and dromedary camels. we searched clinicaltrials.gov on aug 23, 2019, with the keywords "mers" and "vaccine"; five studies were listed. except for one study that evaluated immunoglobulins as treatment against mers, the other four tested mers vaccine platforms. three of these vaccine platforms were to be tested in phase 1 trials: chadox1, mva, and a dna vaccine, with the latter progressing to a phase 1/2a trials. the dna vaccine phase 1 trial was done in the usa and a phase 1/2a study was recently initiated in seoul (south korea). the first human data on a mers vaccine candidate were published in july, 2019, presenting the safety and immunogenicity of the dna vaccine candidate gls-5300. we aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity data of the first mva viral vector vaccine candidate against mers proceeding to clinical trials.this study provides comprehensive results of a phase 1 trial testing an mva vector-based vaccine expressing the mers-cov-s protein. the study reveals a benign safety profile of mva-mers-s and provides first insight into the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. participants who received the high dose of 1 × 10⁸ plaque-forming unit (pfu) experienced mild-to-moderate adverse events and showed seroconversion, and 91% of these patients showed t-cell responses. the low-dose group (1 × 10⁷ pfu) showed a similar safety profile, seroconversion in 75% of participants, and t-cell immunity in 83% of participants.in the aftermath of the ebola virus outbreak in west africa in 2013-16, who has flagged the need for the timely development of vaccines for high-threat pathogens, including mers-cov. the data presented here support the further clinical development of the candidate vaccine mva-mers-s and add critical insight into the field of vaccine research against coronaviruses and other emerging pathogens.mers vaccine candidate mva-mers-s investigated in this study encodes the full mers-cov spike glycoprotein. preclinical studies have shown that mva-mers-s induced neutralising antibodies 6 and conferred protection against mers-cov in mice 15 expressing the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) receptor. furthermore, a reduction in viral replication in a mers-cov challenge after mva-mers-s vaccination was successfully demonstrated in dromedary camels. 16 these preclinical data support the advancement of the vaccine candidate mva-mers-s to test the safety and immunogenicity in human clinical trials.we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data for a novel viral-vectored mers candidate vaccine in healthy adults.this open-label, phase 1 study was done at the university medical center hamburg-eppendorf (hamburg, germany). participants were recruited through public advertisement. we included men and women aged 18-55 years with no clinically significant health problems as determined during medical history and physical examination, a body-mass index of 18·5-30·0 kg/m² and weight of more than 50 kg at screening, and a negative pregnancy test for women. a key exclusion criterion was previous mva immunisation. the full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the protocol (appendix pp 45-46).all participants provided written, informed consent. the study design was reviewed and approved by the competent national authority (paul-ehrlich-institut, langen, germany) and the ethics committee of the hamburg medical association. the study was done in accordance with the declaration of helsinki (fortaleza, brazil, 2013) and international conference on harmonisation good clinical practice. a local safety monitoring board provided clinical oversight.mva-mers-s is based on a rmva vector encoding the full-length mers-cov spike glycoprotein, based on the sequence of emc/2012 (genbank accession number jx869059). 6 the vaccine was manufactured by idt biologika (dessau, germany) in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts.for the prime immunisation, participants received doses of 1 × 10⁷ plaque-forming unit (pfu) (low-dose group) or 1 × 10⁸ pfu (high-dose group) mva-mers-s intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle of the nondominant arm. a second identical dose was administered intramuscularly as a booster immunisation 28 days after first injection. for safety reasons, participants were vaccinated in a staggered manner (appendix p 49). 7 days after administration of prime and boost doses to the last study participant in the low-dose group and review of all safety data by the local safety board, the same staggered mode of vaccinations was applied in the high-dose group. as a control group for immunogenicity analyses, blood samples were drawn at identical study timepoints from six healthy adults, who did not receive any injections.each individual underwent physical examination and drug and pregnancy testing, and received an electrocardiogram the evening before each immunisation at the clinical trial center north (hamburg, germany). heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature were recorded by study personnel 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h after each vaccination. blood was drawn for chemical and haematological safety analyses. participants were monitored longitudinally for 180 days, with study visits the day before vaccination (day -1), the day of vaccination (day 0), and days 1, 3, 7, 14, 27, 28, 29, 35, 42, 56, 84 , and 180 after vaccination, including two overnight stays with an approximate duration of 36 h (days -1 to 1 for the prime immunisation and days 27 to 29 for the booster immunisation). clinical and laboratory evaluations were done during each study visit (appendix p 4). laboratory analyses included measurements of complete blood counts, creatinine, c-reactive protein (crp), troponin, and liver function markers.local and systemic reactogenicity as well as medication use were recorded by the participants for 14 days after each vaccination on a daily notification sheet and were further recorded on follow-up visits by study personnel. adverse events were classified as mild (no interference with activities of daily living), moderate (interference with daily living activities, but pose no substantial or permanent risks to the participants), or severe (considerably affect daily living and clinical status). adverse events were assessed and categorised on the basis of whether they were solicited (expected and therefore predefined in the protocol) or unsolicited events. solicited events included both local (pain, induration, redness, haematoma, and swelling at injection site) and systemic adverse events (fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, loose stools, abdominal cramps, and nausea). unsolicited adverse events were all other events not defined as solicited and all events that arose between days 14 and 28 as well as after day 42 (14 days after the booster vaccination). the occurrence of serious adverse events was monitored throughout the study. a serious adverse event was defined as any event that results in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospital admission or caused prolongation of an existing hospital stay, resulted in persistent disability, or required inter vention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. adverse events were listed and graded by study personnel according to the common terminology criteria for adverse events (version 4.0) and the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (appendix pp 67-68).serum was analysed at days 0, 28, 35, 42, 56, 84, and 180 to evaluate humoral immune responses. we did an see online for appendix elisa by coating 96-well microtitre plates with 1 μg/ml mers-cov s1 protein, as previously described. 17 absorbance was measured at 450 nm. a cutoff was set at an optical density of 0·5. an optimised commercial mers-cov s1 elisa assay (euroimmun, lubeck, germany) was done as a post-hoc additional analysis.the presence of mers-cov-neutralising antibodies in sera of participants was investigated with the virus neutralisation test, which was used to measure the neutralising capacity of sera on huh-7 cells infected with mers-cov (emc/2012) in four replicates, with a reciprocal titre of 8 considered to be positive, as previously described. 15 neutralisation was defined as absence of cytopathic effects.additionally, sera were tested for neutralisation capacity with a plaque reduction neutralisation test (using emc/2012). 17 the plaque reduction neutral isation test (prnt) titre of each serum sample is the reciprocal value of the highest dilution resulting in an infection reduction of 80% or more (prnt 80 ). a titre of 20 or more was considered to be positive. details of all three methods are described in the appendix (pp [4] [5] .peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated and cryopreserved from edta blood using ficoll density gradient centrifugation. t-cell responses were assessed with interferon-γ (ifnγ)-linked enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (elispot; immunospot, cellular technology, cleveland, oh, usa; 384-well plate). following thawing and resting, pbmcs were stimulated for 16 h in triplicates with five overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire mers-cov-s amino acid sequence. a phytohemagglutinin pool and a cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, and influenza peptide pool (jpt peptide technologies, berlin, germany) served as positive controls, and serum-free medium (cellular technology) supplemented with dimethyl sulphoxide served as negative controls. a response was defined as positive when two criteria were met: first, more than 50 spot-forming cells (sfcs) per million pbmcs; and second, the number of sfcs per million pbmcs was more than four times higher than the baseline (day 0) value. for more details, see appendix (p 5).antigen-specific cd4 ifnγ-expressing and cd8 ifnγexpressing t cells were analysed using flowcytometry. following overnight resting, pbmcs were incubated for 6 h at 37°c with overlapping peptide pools. cells were analysed on an lsrfortessa (bd biosciences, franklin lakes, nj, usa) and evaluated with flowjo10 (version 10.6.1; flowjo, ashland, or, usa).the primary endpoints of frequency and severity of adverse events was measured as the occurrence of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity signs and symptoms for 14 days after vaccination; occurrence of unsolicited adverse events for 28 days after vaccination; change from baseline of safety laboratory measures; and occurrence of serious adverse events throughout the study period of 6 months. the secondary endpoint of immunogenicity was the magnitude of mers-cov spike-specific antibody responses as measured by elisa. preplanned exploratory analyses included evaluation of t-cell immunity by elispot.this trial was designed as an exploratory trial and was not powered statistically to measure a specific outcome or determine dose finding. all participants who were vaccinated at least once were included in the safety analysis. immunogenicity was analysed in the participants who completed 6 months of follow-up. recorded adverse events are depicted in frequency (%) of participants in each dose group who experienced at least one adverse event in the indicated symptom group. in case a participant reported two adverse events with differing degrees in the same symptom group, the more severe event was recorded. to correlate binding and neutralising antibodies against mers-cov, we did a spearman correlation between elisa optical density values and the reciprocal titre of neutralising antibodies.we analysed data by wilcoxon signed-rank testing for paired samples and mann-whitney u testing for unpaired samples. a p value of 0·05 or less was considered to be significant. p values were not corrected for multiple comparisons. we did statistical analyses using graphpad prism (version 8).this trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov, nct03615911, and eudract, 2014-003195-23.the funder of this investigator-initiated study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. the corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.between dec 17, 2017, and june 5, 2018, 63 individuals were screened and 26 participants were enrolled (figure 1). details of the participants' baseline characteristics are summarised in the table 1.three individuals (one in the low-dose group and two in the high-dose group) did not receive the booster immunisation and were excluded from the immunogenicity analysis; however, all data were included in the safety investigations. the two participants in the lowdose group discontinued because of personal reasons within the first 14 days of study and were replaced. both replacements completed the follow-up visits. a third person (high-dose group) who dropped out received no booster immunisation because of an unrelated urinary tract infection on day 27. this person was not replaced at this stage of the trial.the full prime-boost vaccination regimen was administered to 23 participants at an interval of 28 days. all 23 participants completed the scheduled follow-up visits up to 6 months. one participant from the low-dose group moved the day 180 follow-up visit to day 110 because of a change of residence. this timepoint was excluded from the immuno genicity analysis. there were no other protocol violations.in the monitoring of acute reactogenicity following immunisations, no serious adverse events were reported. 67 vaccine-related adverse events were reported in ten (71%) of 14 participants in the low-dose group and 111 were reported in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the high-dose group. the majority was solicited and mild, with a few moderate and no severe adverse events. most adverse events appeared early after administration of the vaccine (median 1 day [iqr 1-3]). the high-dose group had more adverse events after prime and boost immunisations than the low-dose group (figure 2a). all adverse events resolved quickly (median 1 day [iqr 0-3]) and generally required no treatment.solicited local reactions were the most common adverse events: pain was observed in 17 (65%; seven participants in the low-dose group vs ten in the high-dose group) parti cipants, swelling in ten (38%; two vs eight) participants, and induration in ten (38%; one vs nine) participants. headaches (observed in seven participants in the low-dose group vs nine participants in the highdose group) and fatigue or malaise (ten vs seven participants) were the most common solicited systemic adverse events (figure 2b). details on adverse events are listed in the appendix (pp [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .two participants in the high-dose group had an elevated temperature and fever about 16 h after prime immunisation (temperatures of 37·8°c and 38·8°c, respectively; appendix pp 7, 8, 18). significant, but transient, asymptomatic decreases in white blood cell and neutrophil counts from day -1 to day 3, as well as lymphocyte and thrombo cyte counts from day -1 to day 1, were observed in the high-dose group ( figure 3; table 2) . the low-dose group also had similar differences, but to a lower extent. crp concentration at day 3 was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the low-dose group (appendix p 7). other laboratory parameters and vital signs did not show significant alterations after vaccinations (data not shown).seroconversion was detected in 20 (87%) of 23 participants (nine [75%] of 12 participants in the low-dose group and 11 [100%] participants in the high-dose group) at any timepoint throughout the study (table 3) .antibody responses were predominantly detected after the second vaccine dose of either the low or the high dose of mva-mers-s. two vaccinated participants (one from the low-dose group and one from the high-dose group) showed a positive elisa response on day 28 after a single mva-mers-s administration. 7 days after boost immunisation (day 35), mers-cov s1-specific antibodies were detectable in both dose groups (table 3) . the majority of vaccinated participants showed positive elisa responses on days 42 and 56 (table 3 ). in the control group, all participants were seronegative except for one participant, who showed a borderline optical density value of 0·5 on day 0, the exact cutoff value for seropositivity ( figure 4a; table 3) . the geometric mean of optical density values for antibody concentrations on day 42 were similar for both cohorts (table 3) . antibody concentrations for both groups decreased over time. positive elisa responses were still observed in 16 (70%) of 23 participants at day 84. at day 180, three (27%) of 11 participants in the low-dose group and none in the high-dose group remained positive for mers-cov spike-specific antibodies. we observed no significant dose dependency in immunogenicity readouts between the low-dose and high-dose groups (day 35 p=0·2944, day 42 p=0·8463, and day 56 p=0·8801, with the mann-whitney u test; data not shown). a post-hoc additional immuno genicity investigation with optimised commercial elisa assay (euroimmun) showed similar confirmatory results (appendix pp [4] [5] .at any timepoint throughout the study, sera from 12 (58%) of 23 participants who were vaccinated neutralised mers-cov using virus neutralisation test (figure 4b). a single injection of mva-mers-s showed no induction of neutralising antibodies. the virus neutralisation test revealed detectable neutralising capacity only after boosting, but mainly in participants in the low-dose group, with a peak response on day 42, when seven (58%) of 12 participants reacted positively, compared with two (18%) of 11 participants in the high-dose group. at the end of the study (day 180), two (9%; one in each dose group) still had detectable neutralising capacity by the virus neutralisation test.in the more sensitive prnt 80 assay (figure 4c), antibody responses mirrored a similar pattern as observed using the in-house elisa (figure 4a). a single vaccine administration induced neutralising antibodies in one participant (in the low-dose group). after boost immunisation, nine (75%) participants in the low-dose group and nine (82%) participants in the high-dose group showed responses. boosting elicited a significant increase in neutralising antibody responses at day 42 compared with baseline in both groups (day 42 p<0·0010 in both groups; wilcoxon signed-rank test; appendix p 17).a linear correlation between elisa optical density values and the reciprocal titre of neutralising antibodies (pnrt 80 ) was observed for day 35 (r=0·86 [95% ci 0·6960-0·9427], p=0·0001; figure 4d), suggesting a high proportion of functional antibodies among the vaccineinduced mers-cov spike-specific binding antibodies. the highest number of positive responses in both the in-house mers-cov s1 elisa and the prnt 80 assays were detected on days 42 and 56 in 16 (70%) of 23 vaccinated participants (seven in the low-dose group and nine in the high-dose group; data not shown). antibodies directed against the vaccines vector were also assessed. after boost vaccination, mva-specific neutralising antibodies were detectable in 19 (83%) of 23 vaccine recipients (eight in the low-dose group and 11 in the high-dose group). no correlation with mers-cov-specific binding or neutralising antibody responses was observed (data not shown).mers-cov spike-specific t-cell responses were evaluated by elispot, using five overlapping peptide pools (figure 5a). representative elispot wells are shown in the appendix (p 21). t-cell responses against mers-cov spike emerged after a single vaccination with mva-mers-s in some of the participants and were enhanced after boost immunisation. overall, ifnγ secretion was detected in ten (83%) of 12 participants in the low-dose group and ten (91%) of 11 participants in the high-dose group at one or more timepoints throughout the study.t-cell responses were observed to all peptide pools; however, responses to pool m2 were more frequently detected ( figure 5b ). both groups showed an increase in ifnγ secretion compared with day 0, which was detected in the low-dose group on day 28 and in the high-dose group on day 35 at the earliest. a peak response was observed for m2 at day 42 (appendix p 21).the highest magnitudes of ifnγ responses were observed for two participants in the low-dose group upon m1-pool stimulation (622 and 522 sfcs per million pbmcs, respectively). an additional post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of six participants (three in each group) demonstrated mers-cov spike-specific secretion of ifnγ predominantly from cd8 t cells rather than from cd4 t cells when using flowcytometry (appendix p 22).taking into account the number of assay responders over time, both dose cohorts showed a similar pattern: the earliest assay responders were identified at day 28 (figure 5c). at day 180, in the low-dose group, six (55%) of 11 participants (one participant was removed from day 180 analysis, as outlined previously) still showed positive t-cell responses, and in the high-dose group, one participant showed a response. to evaluate the breadth of t-cell responses, we assessed the number of pools to which the participants responded. the highdose group revealed a response to more than one pool already at day 28, which reduced in breadth over time. by com parison, the low-dose group showed an increase in breadth only after the boost immunisation ( figure 5d ).taken together, these data show that immunisation with mva-mers-s induced t-cell responses, which decreased during the study period but remained detectable. following homologous prime and boost immunisations with mva-mers-s, no single severe or serious adverse events were observed in participants who received either the low dose or the high dose of the vaccine. all participants experienced transient, self-limiting, mild-to-moderate adverse events, mostly dose-dependent local reactions as well as unspecific systemic adverse events. these data demonstrate a favourable safety profile for both doses and two administrations. safety signals were similar to those observed in a phase 1 trial testing the influenza vaccine mva-h5-sfmr, 18 in which participants received the same doses with the identical mva backbone. similar safety profiles have been observed in other trials using the mva platform with inserted antigens derived from pathogens. 11, 12, 19 comparison of mva-mers-s vaccine-induced safety profiles suggests vector-specific rather than insertspecific safety signals. no mers-cov-specific adverse events as outlined by the brighton collaboration were observed. vaccination with mva-mers-s elicited both humoral and cellular immune responses to mers-cov spike, which were mostly detectable following boost rather than prime immunisation. the humoral immune responses, measured by elisa and two different viral neutralisation assays, revealed a peak of antibody responses at days 42 and 56, were maintained through day 84, and declined to baseline levels in the majority of study participants by end of study (6 months after vaccination). although the exact contribution of mers-cov-specific antibodies to immune protection against mers remains to be further elucidated, preclinical data support their role in protection against virus challenge in animal models. 6, 9, 20, 21 a significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral rna transcripts in mva-mers-s-vaccinated dromedary camels was observed following mers-cov challenge that was associated with mers-cov-specific neutralising antibodies. 16 albeit not an optimal animal model, mouse studies can support the investigation into protective mechanisms. mice are not susceptible to mers-cov, but with expression of human dpp4 (transgenic mice or adenoviral-mediated delivery), mers-cov can infect mouse cells and challenge experiments can be supported. the impact of antibodies on immune protection through passive immunotherapy with subsequent challenge experi ments was evaluated. passive immunotherapy before mers-cov challenge using mers-cov-specific mono clonal antibodies or sera obtained from mers-cov-positive immune dromedary camels showed protection in mice expressing human dpp4. [20] [21] [22] although safety and tolerability of anti-mers-cov polyclonal antibody treat ment in humans has been demonstrated, 23 protection against mers in humans has not yet been documented.notably, mouse experiments demonstrated the generation of neutralising antibodies upon mva-mers-s vaccination, which only partially mediated neutralisation by the receptor-binding domain (rbd), 6 indicating that other parts of the mers-cov spike glycoprotein might also induce neutralising antibodies. in this context, a notable outcome of the mouse experiments was the protective capacity of s1-specific non-rbd and s2-specific neutralising mouse antibodies against mers-cov. 6, 7, 24 furthermore, it was demonstrated that s2 monoclonal antibodies showed only moderate neutralising capacity in vitro but were highly protective from challenge in vivo, suggesting that strong neutralising activity is not conditional for protection. 7 future analyses should therefore include not only mers-cov s1-specific but also s2specific antibody assays, and other functional antibody read-outs beyond neutralisation capacity, which are currently understudied. systems-serology approaches including non-neutralising functions such as antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis might provide insight into mva-mers-s-induced immunity and dissect addi tional mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection. however, it should be noted that although animal studies indicate a crucial role for antibodies in protection against mers, the human data available from mers-cov-infected individuals so far did not reveal a clear and strong correlation between mers-cov-specific antibody responses and mers-cov viral load. 25, 26 reports on individuals with mers-cov infection revealed predominantly t-cell responses as opposed to antibody responses in survivors as well as exposed dromedary camel workers. 9, 27 although it has not yet been determined that t-cell responses are crucial for mers-cov clearance in humans, animal models have provided evidence that t cells support viral clearance in mice. 8, 15 in this study, we detected vaccine-induced t-cell responses against mers-cov spike, which were present even before the second immunisation. responses persisted until day 180 in a third of study participants (seven [32%] of 22 participants), suggesting that vaccine-induced t-cell responses were maintained slightly longer than humoral immune responses (three [14%] of 22 participants). we observed stronger and more robust t-cell responses in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group. although this finding was not significant, it might be considered in future studies that focus on dose finding when including a larger number of participants. however, the exact contribution of t-cell immunity to vaccine-induced or natural protection against the disease and viral clearance remains to be determined and needs further investigation.to complement our analyses on vaccine-induced immunity to the mers-cov spike antigenic insert of the vector vaccine, we also investigated vector immunity to the mva backbone. mva-specific humoral responses against the mva vector were assessed post-hoc using a virus neutralisation test assay against wild-type mva to address their potential effect on mers-cov spike-specific antibodies. although mva-specific neutralising antibodies were induced, no correlation with mers-cov-specific binding or neutralising antibody responses was observed. currently, there is no strong evidence that induced or preexisting mva-specific immunity interferes with vaccineinduced immune responses when using mva as a vector. our study and the trial using mva-h5-sfmr 18 show that mva-based vaccines can elicit antibody responses against the antigenic insert following the second and third immunisation, despite the induction of anti-vector immunity after the prime injection. the exact impact of preexisting immune responses against mva requires further investigation in future studies.rapid induction of vaccine-induced immunity following single-shot vaccination schemes is considered to be part i cularly useful in outbreak scenarios; however, mva-mers-s showed no induction of strong mva-mers-s-specific immune responses following a single prime vaccination, which might reduce its direct applicability in acute outbreak scenarios. in the context of limited human data on correlates of protection, it is currently challenging to predict whether mva-mers-s is suitable for rapidly evolving epidemic situations, because it remains unclear which specific parameters are relevant for the defence against mers-cov. it is conceivable that homologous mva prime-boost vaccination might not be the final and optimised vaccination schedule for mva-mers-s. different strategies including heterologous prime-boost regimens should be evaluated in future trials. several mers vaccine candidates are currently being tested in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations is funding five different vaccine platforms, with mva-mers-s, chadox1, and dna being the most advanced. in the first mers vaccine trial in humans reported to date, which investigated a dna-based vaccine (gls-5300), 28 a homologous primeboost-boost regime was used. similar to our study, the authors observed a favourable safety profile and induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses. although seroreactivity and cellular responses were largely maintained over the study period of 60 weeks, neutralising antibodies were detectable in only 48% of vaccine recipients, peaked about 2 weeks after the second boost, and rapidly declined.additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether heterologous prime-boost vaccination schedules with a mva-mers-s, chadox1, or dna prime and a boost with mva-mers-s can induce immune responses protective against mers-cov infection or can at least favourably modulate the mers disease course.further studies are warranted to improve our detailed understanding of the role of antibody titres, neutralising and non-neutralising antibodies, and cellular immune responses in both natural and vaccine-induced pro tective mers-cov-specific immunity, to further enhance and accelerate strategic vaccine development against mers. the ultimate assessment of vaccine efficacy will be challenging because outbreaks are unpredictable and the number of mers cases has been relatively low.although the data presented here make a valuable contribution to the mers vaccine agenda and enterprise, the study also has limitations. the restricted number of study participants in this phase 1 trial limits the generalisability of results and necessitates follow-up studies in larger cohorts. the study did also not include an additional late boost, which induced strong and increased antibody responses in a previous mva-h5-sfmr trial. 18 this early study format also did not allow for data generation on antibody dependent enhancement in the context of mers-cov infections, which has been previously discussed for severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus. 29 future studies in animal models, possibly including adoptive transfer experiments with sera derived from vaccinated individuals, as well as clinical trials will need to address this crucial aspect.in conclusion, the phase 1 trial investigating the candidate vaccine mva-mers-s showed a benign safety profile and provides the first evidence of humoral and cellular immunogenicity induced by this candidate vaccine in humans. the data generated so far support its further development as a mers vaccine candidate for homologous or heterologous vaccination schemes, possibly involving other viral vector vaccines. in 2018, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations included mva-mers-s in its funding portfolio to support scalable manufacturing and further clinical development to evaluate safety and immunogenicity in larger cohorts and endemic areas. the favourable profile of mva-mers-s might also make useful contributions for the development of future vaccine strategies against other coronavirus pathogens, such as the recently emerged sars coronavirus 2. however, crucial knowledge gaps remain to be addressed. blh is listed as inventor on a

[1] . mers-cov, a zoonotic virus, has bats as its natural reservoir and possibly dromedary camels as its intermediate host [2, 3] . mers-cov infects humans, especially the elderly, people with diabetes and chronic lung diseases, and immunocompromised persons, causing severe disease with high mortality (~35%). the mers outbreak has resulted in 1474 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 515 deaths as of august 27, 2015 [4] . there is still a possibility for mers-cov to spread within healthcare facilities, to which a number of cases have been linked [5, 6] . most mers cases have been reported from saudi arabia, but south korea is the second largest country with travel-associated mers cases, which can all be traced back to saudi arabia. the continuous spread of mers-cov possibly through camel-to-human and human-to-human transmission has raised worldwide concerns, calling for immediate steps to develop effective and safe vaccines.the genome of mers-cov encodes at least four unique accessory proteins, such as 3, 4a, 4b and 5, two replicase proteins (open reading frame 1a and 1b), and four major structural proteins, including spike (s), envelope (e), nucleocapsid (n), and membrane (m) proteins [7] . the accessory proteins play nonessential roles in mers-cov replication, but they are likely structural proteins or interferon antagonists, modulating in vivo replication efficiency and/or pathogenesis, as in the case of sars-cov [7] [8] [9] . the other proteins of mers-cov maintain different functions in virus replication. the e protein, for example, involves in virulence, and deleting the e-coding gene results in replication-competent and propagation-defective viruses or attenuated viruses [7] . the s protein is particularly essential in mediating virus binding to cells expressing receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp4) through receptor-binding domain (rbd) in the s1 subunit, whereas the s2 subunit subsequently mediates virus entry via fusion of the virus and target cell membranes [10, 11] . therefore, these viral structural proteins, particularly s protein, may serve as targets for vaccine development. it is demonstrated that all circulating human mers-cov strains represent one single serotype and that virus isolates from other parts of the outbreaks have no differences from emc2012, the prototype strain, in replication, interferon escape responses and serum neutralization, suggesting that vaccines developed based on the prototype virus strain unlikely affect their success against other virus strains [12,13].no mers vaccines are available for human use. vaccines against mers-cov thus far developed in the laboratory can be categorized as those based on viral vectors, such as adenovirus (ad) and modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva), or those based on recombinant viral proteins, dnas, nanoparticles, and recombinant virus ( table 1) .most viral vector-based mers vaccines use the full-length s or s1 protein of mers-cov as the coding antigens and exhibit immunogenicity in vaccinated animals. reports have indicated that recombinant ad5 vectors, which encode the full-length or s1 extracellular domain, of mers-cov s protein induced mers-cov s-specific antibody responses in immunized mice, neutralizing mers-cov infection in vitro [14] . ad5 or ad41 vectors expressing full-length s protein of mers-cov have elicited mers-cov-specific antibody responses, neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses in immunized mice [15] . moreover, a viral vector mva-based mers vaccine expressing viral s protein, termed mva-mers-s, demonstrated efficacy against mers-cov infection in ad/dpp4-transduced mice [16, 17] . these studies suggest the potential of applying mers-cov s protein as a vaccine target. the german center for infection research (dzif) has supported the phase i clinical trial of mva-mers-s vaccine candidate in humans. about usd $1.66 million was awarded to initiate this trial [18] .in addition to viral vector-based vaccines, vaccines based on the recombinant mers-cov s protein, in particular, rbd, have demonstrated efficacy in protecting immunized animals from mers-cov infection [19, 20] . several fragments, including residues 350 --588, 358 --588, 367 --588, 367 --606, 377 --588, and 377 --662, in the rbd of mers-cov s are shown to induce mers-cov neutralizing antibody responses in mice and/or rabbits [21, 22] . thus, similar to the rbd of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), the mers-cov rbd also contains a critical neutralizing domain (cnd) capable of eliciting highly potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against infection from mers-cov. particularly, a fragment containing residues 377 --588 of mers-cov rbd has been identified as a cnd able to protect ad5/hdpp4-transduced and hdpp4transgenic mice against mers-cov. notably, s377 --588 is a very effective immunogen, as 1 µg of s377 --588 protein could induce potent neutralizing antibody responses similar to those raised by high doses, such as 5 and 20 µg, respectively [23, 24] . these reports all confirm that the rbd/cnd of mers-cov in the s protein is an important target for the development of mers subunit vaccines.dna vaccines are proven to be effective against mers-cov infection. an optimized dna vaccine encoding full-length s protein of mers-cov was able to elicit antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, camels and rhesus macaques (non-human primates, nhps), with six of the eight vaccinated macaques showing no radiographic evidence of infiltration after mers-cov challenge. interestingly, potent antigen-specific cellular immune responses were induced in the immunized macaques, suggesting that t cell responses may also play a role in mers-cov protection [25] . inovio pharmaceuticals inc., in collaboration with geneone life science, will perform a phase i clinical trial for this dna-based vaccine [26] . in addition to the dna-only strategy, dna-priming and protein-boosting could be an alternative vaccine approach for mers-cov. it is revealed that full-length s dna priming and s1 subunit protein boosting immunization of mice and nhps induced robust neutralizing antibody responses against several mers-cov strains, protecting nhps from mers-cov challenge [27] .other potential candidates have been suggested as mers vaccines. for example, purified mers-cov full-length s nanoparticles in combination with appropriate adjuvants could elicit neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice [28] . using reverse genetics, recombinant mers-cov may efficiently replicate in cell culture of human cell lines with broad tissue tropism, allowing an engineered mutant mers-cov lacking the structural e protein to be rescued and propagate in cells expressing the e protein in trans, thus providing a platform to develop live-attenuated, or recombinant, mers-cov-based vaccines [7, 9] .the induction of neutralizing antibodies is the key to the prevention of mers-cov infection, as supported by the fact that the reduction of lung pathogenesis and protection from mers-cov infection has been correlated with neutralizing antibody levels in the animal models [23, 29] . in addition, vaccines that enjoy a high safety profile, combined with the ability to induce broad-spectrum immune responses and strong protective neutralizing antibodies, should have top priority for further development.efficacy and protective immunity of mers candidate vaccines are, of necessity, evaluated in appropriate animal models. thus, before moving to clinical trials, nhp rhesus macaque and common marmoset models [30, 31] and camel model [32] , have been established and utilized for such purposes. however, the use of nhp and camel models is financially and facility restrictive for many researchers. fortunately, recent advancements in establishing small animal models, including ad5/hdpp4-transduced mouse model [33] and hdpp4-transgenic mouse models [34] , have provided a portable and economical platform for assessing the efficacy of mers candidate vaccines, despite the fact that each of these animal models has its advantages and disadvantages.although very promising, the recombinant mers-covbased vaccines will need to be further characterized in suitable mers-cov animal models to confirm their efficacy and safety. viral vector-based vaccines, on the other hand, may show protective immunity in challenged mouse animals. however, these vaccines might have safety concerns by the presence of pre-existing immunity in humans (in the case of ad) or the potential to induce harmful immune responses. thus, safety tests are strongly recommended. also, this vaccine type might lead to incomplete protection or fail to protect aged groups, as shown in the case of sars-cov vaccines [35] . by comparison, recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines possess the highest safety profile because they utilize full-length spike protein, or its subunit (e.g., s1) or fragment (e.g., rbd) as the antigen. in the presence of suitable adjuvants, this type of vaccine is generally able to induce higher titers of neutralizing antibody responses than those elicited by other vaccine types, and they can be easily injected via different pathways, including intramuscular injection, an adopted route for human vaccines. importantly, some of these mers subunit vaccines are shown to be protective against mers-cov infection in challenged mouse and/or nhp models [23, 27] , demonstrating their ability for further scaleup and/or human clinical trials.among these recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines, we believe that rbd-based vaccines are more effective and safer than those based on the full-length s protein. rbd contains the cnd in the s protein, and most of the highly potent neutralizing antibodies target the rbd [21,36-38]. recombinant proteins containing rbd induce strong neutralizing antibody responses and protection in the vaccinated animals against mers-cov infection [21, 23] . in contrast, the full-length s protein contains some non-neutralizing immunodominant domains, which may compromise the immunogenicity with the cnd in rbd, or even induces virus-enhancing or harmful immune responses, as demonstrated in the s protein of sars-cov [39] . this may be one of the reasons that the development of full-length s protein-based sars vaccine has been discontinued. one may criticize that the vaccines based on the rbd sequences of the current mers-cov strains might be not effective against future emerged mers-cov strains with mutations in rbd. this should not be a problem for rbd-based vaccines because rbd contains several conformational neutralizing epitopes, and thus mutation(s) in one epitope may not significantly affect the neutralizing activity of antibodies elicited by other epitopes. for example, the rbd-specific mab f11 could not neutralize the bisha1 strain of mers-cov, whose rbd contains 509 mutation, but susceptible to neutralization of d12, another mers-cov rbdspecific mab [27] . previous studies have demonstrated that rbd of sars-cov tor2 strain, which contains six different conformational neutralizing epitopes, induces antibodies in the vaccinated animals with neutralizing activity against all sars-cov strains tested, including those caused by the early sars outbreaks (e.g., gd03 strain) and late sars pandemics (e.g., urbani strain), as well as the sars-like cov strain from civets (sz strain) [40] . although some epitopes outside mers-cov rbd may have neutralizing activity, such ability is significantly lower than that of the rbd. for example, neutralizing mabs g2 and g4 target epitopes at mers-cov s1 and s2, respectively, both of which are outside the rbd, their neutralizing ability is not as potent as rbd-specific mabs f11 and d12 [27] . nevertheless, these non-rbd neutralizing epitopes, if being clearly identified, could be potentially included in vaccine design to increase the breadth and strength of mers-cov vaccines.it is common knowledge that the process of vaccine approval is long and that it is further complicated by regulatory restrictions and a shortage of funds. as a case in point, ad5.mers-s/ad5.mers-s1 viral vector full-length s/s1 mice preclinical [14] mva-mers-s viral vector full-length s hdpp4-transduced

urgently needed, yet big pharma has consistently refused to invest funds for manufacturing or developing in pre-clinical and clinical studies based on the uncertainty of immediate return on such investments. in addition, adequate financial support from government entities is not guaranteed by the general lack of funds. as noted above, however, some firms in u.s. and dzif academy in germany have taken the first step toward clinical trials of the two mers vaccines based on dna and viral vector, respectively. big pharma and governments of these countries and other parts of the world should take note of this signal and act accordingly.the authors were funded by nih grants r21ai109094, r21ai111152 and r01ai098775, as well as intramural funds from the new york blood center, grant

special note have been highlighted as either of interest () or of considerable interest () to readers. this was the one of the papers showing the protective immunity induced by mers-cov full-length s-based vaccines in nhps.middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), an emerging infectious disease first identified in june 2012, is caused by the novel mers-coronavirus (mers-cov) [1]. mers-cov, a zoonotic virus, has bats as its natural reservoir and possibly dromedary camels as its intermediate host [2, 3] . mers-cov infects humans, especially the elderly, people with diabetes and chronic lung diseases, and immunocompromised persons, causing severe disease with high mortality (∼35%). the mers outbreak has resulted in 1474 laboratoryconfirmed cases, including 515 deaths as of august 27, 2015 [4] . there is still a possibility for mers-cov to spread within healthcare facilities, to which a number of cases have been linked [5, 6] . most mers cases have been reported from saudi arabia, but south korea is the second largest country with travel-associated mers cases, which can all be traced back to saudi arabia. the continuous spread of mers-cov possibly through camel-to-human and human-to-human transmission has raised worldwide concerns, calling for immediate steps to develop effective and safe vaccines.the genome of mers-cov encodes at least four unique accessory proteins, such as 3, 4a, 4b and 5, two replicase proteins (open reading frame 1a and 1b), and four major structural proteins, including spike (s), envelope (e), nucleocapsid (n), and membrane (m) proteins [7] . the accessory proteins play nonessential roles in mers-cov replication, but they are likely structural proteins or interferon antagonists, modulating in vivo replication efficiency and/or pathogenesis, as in the case of sars-cov [7] [8] [9] . the other proteins of mers-cov maintain different functions in virus replication. the e protein, for example, involves in virulence, and deleting the e-coding gene results in replication-competent and propagationdefective viruses or attenuated viruses [7] . the s protein is particularly essential in mediating virus binding to cells expressing receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dpp4) through receptor-binding domain (rbd) in the s1 subunit, whereas the s2 subunit subsequently mediates virus entry via fusion of the virus and target cell membranes [10, 11] . therefore, these viral structural proteins, particularly s protein, may serve as targets for vaccine development. it is demonstrated that all circulating human mers-cov strains represent one single serotype and that virus isolates from other parts of the outbreaks have no differences from emc2012, the prototype strain, in replication, interferon escape responses and serum neutralization, suggesting that vaccines developed based on the prototype virus strain unlikely affect their success against other virus strains [12, 13] .no mers vaccines are available for human use. vaccines against mers-cov thus far developed in the laboratory can be categorized as those based on viral vectors, such as adenovirus (ad) and modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva), or those based on recombinant viral proteins, dnas, nanoparticles, and recombinant virus (table 1) .most viral vector-based mers vaccines use the full-length s or s1 protein of mers-cov as the coding antigens and exhibit immunogenicity in vaccinated animals. reports have indicated that recombinant ad5 vectors, which encode the full-length or s1 extracellular domain, of mers-cov s protein induced mers-cov s-specific antibody responses in immunized mice, neutralizing mers-cov infection in vitro [14] . ad5 or ad41 vectors expressing full-length s protein of mers-cov have elicited mers-cov-specific antibody responses, neutralizing antibodies and t-cell responses in immunized mice [15] . moreover, a viral vector mva-based mers vaccine expressing viral s protein, termed mva-mers-s, demonstrated efficacy against mers-cov infection in ad/dpp4-transduced mice [16, 17] . these studies suggest the potential of applying mers-cov s protein as a vaccine target. the german center for infection research (dzif) has supported the phase i clinical trial of mva-mers-s vaccine candidate in humans. about usd $1.66 million was awarded to initiate this trial [18] .in addition to viral vector-based vaccines, vaccines based on the recombinant mers-cov s protein, in particular, rbd, have demonstrated efficacy in protecting immunized animals from mers-cov infection [19, 20] . several fragments, including residues 350-588, 358-588, 367-588, 367-606, 377-588, and 377-662, in the rbd of mers-cov s are shown to induce mers-cov neutralizing antibody responses in mice and/or rabbits [21, 22] . thus, similar to the rbd of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), the mers-cov rbd also contains a critical neutralizing domain (cnd) capable of eliciting highly potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against infection from mers-cov. particularly, a fragment containing residues 377-588 of mers-cov rbd has been identified as a cnd able to protect ad5/hdpp4-transduced and hdpp4-transgenic mice against mers-cov. notably, s377-588 is a very effective immunogen, as 1 μg of s377-588 protein could induce potent neutralizing antibody responses similar to those raised by high doses, such as 5 and 20 μg, respectively [23, 24] . these reports all confirm that the rbd/cnd of mers-cov in the s protein is an important target for the development of mers subunit vaccines.dna vaccines are proven to be effective against mers-cov infection. an optimized dna vaccine encoding full-length s protein of mers-cov was able to elicit antigen-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, camels and rhesus macaques (non-human primates, nhps), with six of the eight vaccinated macaques showing no radiographic evidence of infiltration after mers-cov challenge. interestingly, potent antigen-specific cellular immune responses were induced in the immunized macaques, suggesting that t cell responses may also play a role in mers-cov protection [25] . inovio pharmaceuticals inc., in collaboration with geneone life science, will perform a phase i clinical trial for this dna-based vaccine [26] . in addition to the dna-only strategy, dna-priming and protein-boosting could be an alternative vaccine approach for mers-cov. it is revealed that full-length s dna priming and s1 subunit protein boosting immunization of mice and nhps induced robust neutralizing antibody responses against several mers-cov strains, protecting nhps from mers-cov challenge [27] .other potential candidates have been suggested as mers vaccines. for example, purified mers-cov full-length s nanoparticles in combination with appropriate adjuvants could elicit neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice [28] . using reverse genetics, recombinant mers-cov may efficiently replicate in cell culture of human cell lines with broad tissue tropism, allowing an engineered mutant mers-cov lacking the structural e protein to be rescued and propagate in cells expressing the e protein in trans, thus providing a platform to develop live-attenuated, or recombinant, mers-cov-based vaccines [7, 9] .the induction of neutralizing antibodies is the key to the prevention of mers-cov infection, as supported by the fact that the reduction of lung pathogenesis and protection from mers-cov infection has been correlated with neutralizing antibody levels in the animal models [23, 29] . in addition, vaccines that enjoy a high safety profile, combined with the ability to induce broad-spectrum immune responses and strong protective neutralizing antibodies, should have top priority for further development.efficacy and protective immunity of mers candidate vaccines are, of necessity, evaluated in appropriate animal models. thus, before moving to clinical trials, nhp rhesus macaque and common marmoset models [30, 31] and camel model [32] , have been established and utilized for such purposes. however, the use of nhp and camel models is financially and facility restrictive for many researchers. fortunately, recent advancements in establishing small animal models, including ad5/hdpp4-transduced mouse model [33] and hdpp4transgenic mouse models [34], have provided a portable and economical platform for assessing the efficacy of mers candidate vaccines, despite the fact that each of these animal models has its advantages and disadvantages.although very promising, the recombinant mers-cov-based vaccines will need to be further characterized in suitable mers-cov animal models to confirm their efficacy and safety. viral vector-based vaccines, on the other hand, may show protective immunity in challenged mouse animals. however, these vaccines might have safety concerns by the presence of pre-existing immunity in humans (in the case of ad) or the potential to induce harmful immune responses. thus, safety tests are strongly recommended. also, this vaccine type might lead to incomplete protection or fail to protect aged groups, as shown in the case of sars-cov vaccines [35] . by comparison, recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines possess the highest safety profile because they utilize full-length spike protein, or its subunit (e.g., s1) or fragment (e.g., rbd) as the antigen. in the presence of suitable adjuvants, this type of vaccine is generally able to induce higher titers of neutralizing antibody responses than those elicited by other vaccine types, and they can be easily injected via different pathways, including intramuscular injection, an adopted route for human vaccines. importantly, some of these mers subunit vaccines are shown to be protective against mers-cov infection in challenged mouse and/or nhp models [23, 27] , demonstrating their ability for further scale-up and/or human clinical trials.among these recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines, we believe that rbd-based vaccines are more effective and safer than those based on the full-length s protein. rbd contains the cnd in the s protein, and most of the highly potent neutralizing antibodies target the rbd [21, [36] [37] [38] . recombinant proteins containing rbd induce strong neutralizing antibody responses and protection in the vaccinated animals against mers-cov infection [21, 23] . in contrast, the full-length s protein contains some non-neutralizing immunodominant domains, which may compromise the immunogenicity with the cnd in rbd, or even induces virus-enhancing or harmful immune responses, as demonstrated in the s protein of sars-cov [39] . this may be one of the reasons that the development of fulllength s protein-based sars vaccine has been discontinued. one may criticize that the vaccines based on the rbd sequences of the current mers-cov strains might be not effective against future emerged mers-cov strains with mutations in rbd. this should not be a problem for rbd-based vaccines because rbd contains several conformational neutralizing epitopes, and thus mutation(s) in one epitope may not significantly affect the neutralizing activity of antibodies elicited by other epitopes. for example, the rbd-specific mab f11 could not neutralize the bisha1 strain of mers-cov, whose rbd contains 509 mutation, but susceptible to neutralization of d12, another mers-cov rbd-specific mab [27] . previous studies have demonstrated that rbd of sars-cov tor2 strain, which contains six different conformational neutralizing epitopes, induces antibodies in the du vaccinated animals with neutralizing activity against all sars-cov strains tested, including those caused by the early sars outbreaks (e.g., gd03 strain) and late sars pandemics (e.g., urbani strain), as well as the sars-like cov strain from civets (sz strain) [40] . although some epitopes outside mers-cov rbd may have neutralizing activity, such ability is significantly lower than that of the rbd. for example, neutralizing mabs g2 and g4 target epitopes at mers-cov s1 and s2, respectively, both of which are outside the rbd, their neutralizing ability is not as potent as rbd-specific mabs f11 and d12 [27] . nevertheless, these non-rbd neutralizing epitopes, if being clearly identified, could be potentially included in vaccine design to increase the breadth and strength of mers-cov vaccines.it is common knowledge that the process of vaccine approval is long and that it is further complicated by regulatory restrictions and a shortage of funds. as a case in point, mers vaccines are urgently needed, yet big pharma has consistently refused to invest funds for manufacturing or developing in pre-clinical and clinical studies based on the uncertainty of immediate return on such investments. in addition, adequate financial support from government entities is not guaranteed by the general lack of funds. as noted above, however, some firms in u.s. and dzif academy in germany have taken the first step toward clinical trials of the two mers vaccines based on dna and viral vector, respectively. big pharma and governments of these countries and other parts of the world should take note of this signal and act accordingly.merging and re-emerging zoonotic viral diseases are major threats to global human health, economic stability, and national security [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . the incidence of human zoonotic disease is estimated to surpass 1 billion cases per year, with novel emerging infectious diseases accruing hundreds of billions of dollars in economic losses 7, 8 , losses that are greatly magnified when new emerging viruses such as coronaviruses (covs) devastate economically critical livestock populations across the globe. with the continued encroachment of human populations into animal habitats and our close contact with domesticated animals, zoonoses will continue to increase as the human and livestock population numbers and density expand over the next century. in fact, a recent study recognized that the majority of emerging infectious disease events have origins in wildlife 3, 8 , underscoring the importance of developing broadly applicable strategies for vaccine design for virus families that are harbored within extensive zoonotic pools.vaccines are well established in their capacity to reduce viral disease burden. live-attenuated vaccines, because they can elicit balanced innate and adaptive-and often lifelong-protective immune responses, including lactogenic immunity, are ideal candidates for vaccine development in humans and animals 1 . however, their utility as broadly applicable vaccine platforms has long been limited by risks of reversion of attenuated vaccine strains to virulence, largely because the stability of the attenuation cannot be clearly evaluated or assured.the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) in the 21st century emphasizes the threat of pandemic viral infections originating from cross-species transmission events [9] [10] [11] . these highly pathogenic variants are prime models for the development of broad-based strategies for evaluating live virus vaccines for the nidovirales order. coronaviruses (covs) all reproduce with conserved replication strategies, emphasizing the strength and rapidly adaptable potential of a vaccine design platform that takes advantage of this biology. covs replicate and transcribe subgenomic rnas (sgrnas) via a discontinuous transcription mechanism mediated by transcription regulatory sequences (trss), a series of conserved nucleotide sequences positioned near the 5′-end of the genome and at several locations immediately 5′ of each downstream open reading frame (orf) (fig. 1) . these trss regulate a transcription attenuation program via base-pairing interactions between the leader trs and body trss that results in the production of sgrnas, from which downstream orfs are translated. within the trs, a 6-to 8-nt core sequence (acgaac for sars-cov) guides base-pairing and duplex formation between nascent rna and the leader trs [12] [13] [14] . while this collective trs arrangement, the transcription regulatory network (trn), is conserved, our laboratory has shown that it is possible to rewire the guide sequence of the sars-cov trn and produce infectious virus 13 . we also showed that recombination between this rewired trn virus and wild-type (wt) sars-cov was not viable, indicating that recombination-mediated reversion of a cov vaccine platform featuring a rewired trn is highly unlikely.based on conservation of the trn biology across covs, this report further explores the feasibility of the development of a stably attenuated vaccine platform featuring a completely rewired trn as a candidate strategy for a broadly applicable, rapidly implementable cov vaccine platform that is highly resistant to recombination repair and stably attenuated in both young and highly vulnerable mouse models of human disease.the 3-nt trn mutant is attenuated for virulence. in a previous study in our laboratory, we demonstrated that the sars-cov trn could be reprogrammed, provided the individual trss were replaced with matching sequences 13 . the rewired trn replaced the conserved 6-nt trs with a 6-nt cassette that is not used in any other characterized covs, encoding a net change of 3 nts (acgaac to ccggau). our previous work showed that this rewired trn was refractory to recombination with wt genomes 13 . therefore, we tested its replication and pathogenesis in young and aged balb/c mice. consistent with earlier reports, wt sars-cov only caused weight loss in aged animals. in contrast, crg3 replicated but caused no weight loss in young (10-week-old) mice (fig. 2a) and minimal weight loss in aged (12month-old) balb/c mice ( fig. 2b ) (young mice: p = 0.25 for titer, wilcoxon test, p = 0.37 for weight loss, mann-whitney test; old mice: p = 0.25 for titer, p < 0.001 for weight loss). both wt and recombinant viruses replicated to high titers that were detectable on days 2 and 4 post-infection (p.i.) in both young and aged animals, with titers beginning to clear by day 7 p.i. (fig. 2c,  d) , as is usually observed in mice infected with sars-cov 1 .vaccination with crg3 protects mice against challenge. the high replication titer and low or absent virulence in young and aged mouse models paired with the inherently recombinationrefractory genome suggested that the crg3 virus would be an ideal vaccine candidate. to test crg3's efficacy in protecting against homologous and heterologous challenge, the virus was administered to mice in a single-dose vaccination, alongside viral replicon particles (vrps) expressing the viral spike attachment protein (vrp-s) as a control 15 . on day 22 post-vaccination, mice were then challenged with either mouse-adapted sars-cov (ma15-homologous challenge) or sars-cov expressing the spike gene from the himalayan palm civet (paguma larvata) strain hcsz6103 (heterologous challenge). mice were then observed for morbidity and mortality, and surviving animals were euthanized on day 4 p.i. upon homologous challenge, crg vaccination was protective against weight loss and mortality in young and aged mice, with no detectable viral titer in the lungs at 4 days p.i., in contrast to pbs and vrp-s subcutaneous vaccination ( fig. 3a-d, supplementary fig. 1a-b) . importantly, against heterologous challenge, while both crg3 and vrp-s vaccines crg vaccination induced sars-cov neutralizing antibody titers approaching 4 log 10 in both young and aged mice, nearly 2-fold higher than the titers induced by vrp-s vaccination (p < 0.0001, two-way anova) ( supplementary fig. 1e ). moreover, crg vaccination largely protected aged mice from the extensive inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue damage, perivascular cuffing, edema, and septal thickening observed in pbs-and vrp-svaccinated mice ( supplementary fig. 2 ).crg3 reverts with pandemic-associated mutations. a liveattenuated vaccine candidate should demonstrate phenotypic stability in infected host populations. therefore, to test its resistance to reversion to virulence, crg3 was subjected to five independent serial passages in parallel with wt sars-cov in aged (14-month-old) balb/c mice. over the course of six 4-day passages, all crg3 passaged viruses acquired a virulent phenotype, with weight losses and percent survival curves mirroring the kinetic rates of the emergence of virulence seen with wt passaged viruses ( supplementary fig. 3 ). to attempt to identify the genotypic causes of this phenotypic reversion to virulence, the genomes of 5 independent plaque isolates of the passage 6 viruses (wt p6 and crg3 p6) were submitted to sanger sequencing. surprisingly, and contrary to expectations, no mutations in either the spike or the membrane protein-both of which were targets for mutational selection in 3 separate adaptations of sars-cov urbani to mice (fig. 4a )-were identified in wt or crg3 revertants. instead, 4 of 5 crg3 p6 isolates showed evidence of often large deletions in the accessory orfs 7b, 8a, and 8b ( fig. 4a, b) . these deletions, often in-frame, were reminiscent of several incidences of host range-associated deletions identified in human isolates from the 2003 sars-cov epidemic, including a 29-nt deletion in orf8 relative to the himalayan palm civet strain 16 and 82-nt 17 and 386-nt 18 deletions in this same region. in contrast, deletions in accessory orfs were rare in virulent wt revertants. rather, scattered nonsynonymous mutations were identified in orf1a, orf3a, orf8a, and orf9. notably, only 1 wt revertant exhibited a small deletion in orf7b. collectively, these findings demonstrated that this region of the sars-cov genome is inherently unstable when subjected to replication pressure, especially in aged animals, and indicated that a trnrewired virus would require additional stabilizing mutations to be feasible as a vaccine candidate.an attenuated sars-cov mutant with a 7-nt trn replacement.the demonstration of second-site reversion to virulence upon passage of crg3 suggested that a more ideal trn-rewired vaccine candidate would be one that would be less likely to phenotypically revert in vivo. cov trs networks are finely tuned and regulate the expression of both highly abundant and lowfrequency mrna transcripts; thus, small changes in the trs might subtly alter the regulation of subgenomic transcripts 13 . moreover, the exact regulatory milieu around each trs is uncertain beyond the recognition that both, up-and downstream sequences can influence mrna expression efficiency, perhaps in a trn sequence-specific manner 19, 20 . we hypothesized that more extensive remodeling of the trs network may better disrupt the finely tuned network of abundant and low-frequency transcripts, altering the natural regulation of global gene expression, and thereby leading to decreased virulence. in addition, it was possible that the virulence observed in crg3 p6 isolates was due, at least in part, to mouse adaptation during passage. therefore, to evaluate the effects of more extensive trn rewiring in a lethal pathogenic model and to further stabilize the trn against recombination repair and mutation selection, a trn mutant was constructed that featured the following: (1) the set of fig. 1 ). these replacements yielded infectious crg7-ma virus that was capable of replicating to titers equivalent to those of the mouse-adapted wt background virus, sars-ma15, though with a pinpoint plaque phenotype that remained stable after tissue culture passage. crg3-ma (9 crg3 replacements in the virulent sars-ma15 backbone) was also generated as a control trn-rewired virus. northern blot analysis of crg7-ma versus crg3 and sars-ma15 revealed that the virus produced the expected bands at similar proportions to wt virus, although some additional low-abundance transcripts were also noted in crg7-ma ( supplementary fig. 4) .these viruses were then evaluated for replication and virulence in young (10-week-old) and aged (12-month-old) balb/c mice in comparison with sars-ma15. in young mice, crg7-ma was attenuated compared with crg3-ma and sars-ma15, causing . 5d-f ).infection of aged balb/c mice with 2 log 10 , 3 log 10 , or 4 log 10 pfu of crg7-ma or sars-ma15 emphasized the attenuated virulence phenotype, with the 2-log 10 pfu infection of crg7-ma causing almost no weight loss over the course of the infection, despite replicating to the same titers as the 3 log 10 and 4 log 10 pfu infections (fig. 5g- between crg7-ma and sars-ma15 infections, with 100% of mice infected with 2 log 10 or 3 log 10 pfu and 60% of mice infected with 4 log 10 pfu surviving the course of crg7-ma infection. in contrast, only 40% of mice infected with 2 log 10 pfu of sars-ma15 survived infection; mice infected with 3 log 10 or 4 log 10 pfu survived only until days 6 or 3 p.i. maximum, respectively (p < 0.0001, log-rank test) (fig. 5i) . when crg7-ma was serially passaged in young (10-week-old) balb/c mice, in contrast to the rapid phenotypic reversion observed with crg3, crg7-ma remained phenotypically stable with passage, with mice losing a minimal (~5%) amount of their starting weight over the 3-day infections throughout all 4 passages ( supplementary  fig. 5a ). viral titer also remained stable over passage, with >5 log 10 pfu detectable at 3 days p.i. in each passage (supplementary fig. 5b) . furthermore, when crg7-ma was serially passaged independently three times for six passages in aged mice, replicating the passage conditions in which crg3 reverted to virulence, crg7-ma did not exhibit an increase in virulence, causing <20% weight loss in infected animals and~60% mortality upon infection of 12-month-old balb/c mice with 10 5 pfu of crg7-ma post-passage, essentially replicating the mortality shown in aged mice infected with non-passaged crg7-ma virus and distinct from the 100% mortality caused by wild-type sars-ma15 infection of aged mice (see fig. 5i , supplementary  fig. 5c -d, and supplementary table 1) . finally, crg7-ma was evaluated for its capacity to protect against lethal sars-ma15 challenge in aged (12-month-old) mice. mice were vaccinated with 2.5 log 10 pfu of either crg7-ma or exon-ma, which we previously demonstrated to be an effective vaccine in the sars-ma15 backbone in the aged balb/ c mouse model of sars-cov pathogenesis 1 . on day 22 postvaccination, mice were then challenged with a lethal dose (5 log 10 pfu) of sars-ma15 and evaluated for weight loss. mice lost only minimal amounts (~5%) of their starting weights with both vaccines (p = 0.125 for both viruses versus pbs vaccination, wilcoxon test), indicating that crg7-ma and exon-ma were equally protective against lethal sars-ma15 challenge (fig. 6 ).live-attenuated vaccines remain key players in reducing the global disease burden associated with viral infections in humans, critically important livestock, and companion animals. historically and contemporarily, live-attenuated vaccines have been used with success to help control measles, mumps, rubella, polio, yellow fever, and chickenpox infections and outbreaks 1, 21, 22 . however, live-attenuated vaccines are also associated with the risk of reversion by either mutation-or recombination-driven processes, which can cause dangerous outbreaks in unvaccinated populations, including animals 22 . for example, highly pathogenic porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) strains emerged in china in 2012, circumventing existing vaccines, and rna recombination events between wild-type and live-attenuated pedv and between avian infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) strains have seeded new outbreaks [23] [24] [25] [26] . therefore, measures are needed to stabilize live-attenuated vaccines against reversion under selective pressure, particularly for viruses like covs, which employ recombination as a standard feature of their replication cycle, as incidental recombination events in the context of a coinfection could unintentionally introduce alleles with enhanced virulence into an attenuated vaccine genome, with consequences that could be difficult to predict 13, 27, 28 . several groups, including our own, have developed novel strategies in fidelity regulation and control that attenuate rna virus pathogenesis, and in the case of covs, the development of mutants that prevent reversion repair to virulence 1, 29 .recombination repair is a well-characterized process essential for genome evolution in many biological systems and plays critical roles in spread, virulence, and pathogenesis 30 . in general, strategies to engineer recombination-resistant rna viruses have been limited to covs and, to a lesser extent, enteroviruses 13, 31 . in the context of a cov infection, recombination occurs when the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) switches templates during nascent rna synthesis, using the nascent rna itself as a primer once the rdrp reassociates with the template genome. the likelihood of a recombination event occurring is regulated by several viral factors, including replication rates, rna secondary structure, genome size, and the nature of the replicase/ transcriptase protein complex; however, the heritability of a recombination, once it has occurred, is mediated by the replication fitness of the resulting progeny genome 13,32-35 . several reports have described the emergence of covs with enhanced virulence that, upon genome analysis, clearly originated from recombination events of related viruses in avian and mammalian hosts, including sars-cov 27, 28, [36] [37] [38] . furthermore, reservoir species, such as bats, from which the prevailing evidence suggests that both potentially lethal human covs, sars-cov and mers-cov, emerged, have been shown to harbor multiple cov species, and recombinant rna genomes have been frequently identified within colonies and among individual infected animals, increasing the likelihood of recombination-driven alterations in species specificity and virulence 16, 27, 39, 40 .thus, engineering elements to render a genome recombination-refractory is an essential step towards ensuring that a live-attenuated vaccine candidate cannot regain virulence during an incidental co-infection with another trn-compatible cov genome. sars-cov is a highly pathogenic pneumo-enteric pathogen that captures many disease features seen among other covs. the trn conserved sequence (cs) motifs utilized in the crg3 and crg7 backgrounds, ccggau and uggucgc, respectively, are both unique sequence motifs when compared with all known cov genome trn sequences, greatly reducing and likely eliminating the possibility of recombination with unmodified genomes at the canonical trs loci. our previous work demonstrated that introducing mismatched trss was lethal for rna recombinant virus replication 13 . furthermore, here, we showed that crg3 trn replacement did not revert at the primary sites of mutation, indicating that the rewired trn is stable and not under sufficient selective pressure to revert, even in vivo. as coordinated interactions are required for trn function, trn reversion is unlikely, given the requirement for nearly simultaneous reversions at multiple sites across the genome. larger-sized trs css (>7 nts) within the trn may not prove effective, as evolution appears to have selected for a cov rna polymerase that is heavily focused on recognizing a 5-to 7-nt trs cs within the trn to regulate subgenomic transcription.the attenuation resulting from trn rewiring is most likely attributed to alterations in the viral transcription profile, lowabundance transcripts that either encode or reduce the expression of previously unidentified out-of-frame orfs, or viral or host factor interactions with the viral genome. the rewired trn produces obvious novel viral rna species (supplementary fig. 4) . these novel rna species may serve as functional mrnas, producing noncanonical viral protein products that attenuate viral replication or pathogenesis. alternatively, these novel rna species may compete with canonical viral rna species for replication and transcription, attenuating viral replication and/or pathogenesis due to the altered availability of transcripts encoding bona fide viral virulence factors. furthermore, the rewired trn itself may serve as an attenuating factor, as the virus' discontinuous transcription program alters programmed rnaprotein interactions (involving both viral and host proteins) either directly (i.e., by altering the bases required for rna-protein interactions) or indirectly (i.e., through changes in the rna's secondary structure that affect the steric availability of rnaprotein interaction sites). moreover, di et al., in an arterivirus model, used next-generation sequencing analysis to show that noncanonical transcripts are produced in the course of wild-type infection, indicating that the coding capacity of nidoviruses is actually much larger than what has been characterized using sanger sequencing and biochemical detection methods. their findings suggest that attenuation via the trn may be able to target noncanonical rna species, which might be able to impact pathogenesis with fewer effects on replication and structural protein production 41 . these fascinating possibilities will be the focus of future studies on the mechanism of trn-related attenuation.the hypothesis that alterations in the expression profiles of canonical viral rna species and protein products attenuate pathogenesis is further strengthened when paired with observations of the types of mutations that were selected upon passage of crg3 in aged mice: mutation profiles were different if selection occurred in young versus aged populations. frieman et al. previously demonstrated that mutations in spike and nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) were repetitively selected in several independent passages and that these mutations conferred virulence in young days post-infection mice, suggesting that spike-viral receptor interactions and nsp9-replicase protein interactions were most important for virulence 42 . in severely ill sars-cov-infected humans (predominantly over 50 years of age), deletions in and around orf8 were identified, as discussed earlier [16] [17] [18] 39 . deletions of different accessory orfs were the most frequently observed changes after selection in aged animals. furthermore, in aged mice, nearly any combination of 2 sars-ma15-identified alleles (shown in fig. 4a ) also conferred increased virulence, most likely reflecting the increased susceptibility of aged mice to lethal outcomes. these data suggest that cov adaptation to virulence is different in young and aged animals, especially when coupled with variations in virus pathogenic determinants. while immune senescence can enhance virus virulence 43 , our data support the novel hypothesis that virulent zoonotic coronaviruses may emerge more quickly after in vivo passage, especially in the aged, where multiple evolutionary pathways exist that can program virus virulence.the disproportionate identification of mutations in the accessory orfs following passage of the crg3 trn virus in aged animals may reflect the roles these accessory orfs are hypothesized to play in the modulation of host immunity 44 . aged animals' immune systems respond differently, and usually more severely, to microbial challenge, with the immune response skewed towards severe innate immune effects and defects in adaptive immunity 45 . however, in the context of cov infection, this augmented immune response, when presented in the context of accessory orf deletion, may serve as a virulence fulcrum, with the balance poised between essential immune recognition and severe disease, possibly due to defects in spread and persistence. these potential effects on host immunity argue that a stable vaccine candidate should consider the potential for changes in accessory orfs.a well-designed vaccine candidate should include genetic traps that are either independently attenuating or triggered by recombination events. we have previously demonstrated both stable attenuation and protection against lethal challenge with inactivations of the nsp14 exonuclease 1 and the nsp16 2′-omethyltransferase 46 activities. in addition, züst et al. demonstrated that a partial deletion of the murine hepatitis virus (mhv) nsp1 replicase protein could protect against homologous and heterologous challenge 47 . combining alleles that render the virus recombination-refractory, alter rna replication fidelity, and that result in an altered host immune response could produce stable, reversion-proof, live-attenuated viruses that induce robust neutralizing immunity. attenuating alleles, coupled with a rewired trn, are anticipated to increase the stability of the attenuation and to minimize the chances for rna recombination repair. the strategies reported herein, coupled with the availability of new molecular clones for covs that cause severe disease in livestock populations, provide a vehicle for improved live virus vaccine design [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . it may also be possible to "tune" the cov trn, with attenuating changes concentrated on virulence alleles, such as accessory genes known to impact pathogenesis. such alterations have the potential to greater enhance the stability of a vaccine candidate, particularly if considering trs context outside of the 5-to 7-nt core sequence. such studies would benefit the most if the rna structure is also considered, as trs accessibility is most likely modulated by structural elements in the cov rna genome. such studies will be the focus of future work.with the continuing identification of zoonotic pools of covs that genetically resemble lethal human and animal covs, often with only a few percentage points of difference between the zoonotic and lethal human sequences 10,54-57 , the necessity for a rapidly implementable, universal attenuation platform for cov live-attenuated vaccine design is underscored. in this report, we described the design and implementation of a cov attenuation strategy that can be easily and rapidly adapted to any cov genome. the presence of 8-9 characterized trss within any cov genome, the css of which are 6-7 nts each, offers too large and complex a target for primary site reversion to be a likely event. as most single recombination events would decouple trn expression networks, these recombinants would be lethal. therefore, this attenuation strategy, when paired with alleles that can resist selection events that lead to second-site reversion, could bring live-attenuated cov vaccines within the reach of realization in the face of the ever-growing threat of new human and animal cov-based epidemics.viruses and cells. all virus stocks were propagated in vero-e6 cells as described in 58 . all virus work was performed in a biological safety cabinet in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.construction of sars plasmids and viruses. trn3-based plasmids were constructed in 13 . trn7 mutations were introduced into sars plasmids a and f using cassettes generated by biobasic. to generate sars-f plasmids containing both trn mutations and the mouse-adapted mutation at nt 2663, the mouse-adapted mutation was cloned into the f trn plasmids via a pcr and restriction digestion strategy. to generate sars-f plasmids containing both trn mutations and the mouse-adapted mutation at nt 2663, the mouse-adapted mutation was cloned into the f trn plasmids via a pcr and restriction digestion strategy. the plasmids f-bstz (5′-ggaggcgcaatttttgtacctctatgccttg-3′), r-mamut (5′-agctatcgtctccgcttctcaacggtaatagtaccgttgtctg-3′), f-mamut (5′-agctatcgtctccaagcttaaacaactcctggaacaa tggaac-3′), and r-msc (5′-gtggcttagctacttcgttgcttcctt caggc-3′) were used to generate 2 amplicons. the resulting amplicons were restriction-digested with bsmb i, ligated, and purified, after which the ligated amplicons and the parent vectors were restriction-digested with bstz17 i and msc i and ligated. ligated vectors were transformed into topten e. coli cells, and the resulting colonies were screened and sequence-verified. viruses were then constructed as described in ref. 58 .northern blot analysis. intracellular rna was isolated using ribopure reagents (ambion, austin, tx) 12 h post-infection 13 . the mrna was then isolated using a qiagen oligotex mrna isolation kit, treated with glyoxal, and separated an agarose gel using northernmax-gly (ambion). the rna was then transferred to brightstar-plus membrane (ambion) for 5 h, cross-linked using uv light, prehybridized, and probed with an n gene-specific oligonucleotide probe (5′-cttgactgccgcctctgct b t b ccct b ct b gc b -3′; biotinylated nucleotides are denoted with a superscripted "b"). the blot was hybridized overnight and washed with low-and high-stringency buffers and was then incubated with phosphataseconjugated streptavidin. the blot was then incubated with cdp-star, overlaid with film, and developed.mouse infections with sars-cov and mutants. all experimental protocols involving mice were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the university of north carolina, chapel hill, nc, usa. the following mice were used: 10-week-old female balb/c (charles river laboratories, wilmington, ma, usa) and 14-month-old female balb/c (harlan laboratories, indianapolis, in, usa). mice were lightly anesthetized and infected intranasally with varying doses (10 2 -10 6 pfu, depending on the experiment) of sars-cov, ma15, or trn mutants. mice were weighed daily, and on certain days specified in each experiment, mouse lungs were harvested for virus titer and/or rna. serial passages were inoculated as above for passage 1; subsequent passages were inoculated with 50 μl of clarified lung homogenate (lungs were homogenized in 1 ml of pbs) from the previous passage. all experiments used a minimum of n = 5 mice per virus per dosage/condition (if applicable) per timepoint. for infection-challenge studies, mice were infected with 10 2 -10 3 pfu of the indicated vaccine virus, weighed for the 7 days following initial infection, and then challenged with a lethal dose (10 6 pfu) of ma15 for the challenge infection.determination of virus titer in infected mouse lungs. lungs harvested for virus titer were weighed and homogenized in 1.0 ml of pbs at 6000 rpm for 60 s in a magnalyser (roche, basel, switzerland). virus titers were determined by plaque assay on vero cells.determination of viral neutralization antibody titers. mouse sera were heatinactivated for 30 min at 55°c and were then serially diluted to 1:100, 1:200, 1:400, 1:800, and 1:1600 in pbs to a volume of 125 μl. next, 125 μl of pbs containing low-concentration sars-cov ma15 (40 pfu) or high-concentration sars-cov ma15 (240 pfu) was added to each serum dilution. the virus-serum mixtures were incubated at 37°c for 30 min. following incubation, virus titers of the mixtures were determined by plaque assay. finally, we calculated the 50% plaque reduction neutralization titer (prnt 50 ) values, the serum dilutions at which plaque formation was reduced by 50% relative to that of virus stock not treated with serum.viral genome sequencing. to determine the sequences of viral genomes present in mouse lungs after passage, plaques were isolated from lung samples as described above. briefly, individual viral plaques were harvested by collecting the agarose plugs above them using a 200-μl pipette tip. each agarose plug was dropped in 0.5 ml pbs, allowed to diffuse for 24 h at 4°c, and then applied to~70% confluent monolayers of vero-e6 cells in t25 flasks and incubated for 48 h at 37°c. infected cell monolayers were then harvested in 1 ml of trizol.

request.received: 31 january 2018 accepted: 19 september 2018the mucosa of the human respiratory tract represents a primary target for a large number of microbial pathogens. typically, colonization is an asymptomatic process, resulting from the interplay between bacterial factors and host clearance mechanisms. clinical illness may result from either the local release of bacterial toxins or the systemic dissemination of the pathogen after breaching the mucosal barrier. in the course of respiratory infections adaptive immune responses could be significantly impaired. this might lead to more severe forms of disease or to super-infections, which in turn complicate the clinical management of the patient. the most severe forms of respiratory infection tend to occur in very young children and among the elderly, in whom immune competence is eroded by immaturity or immunesenescence, respectively. in addition, patients who are immunocompromised, as a result of disease or therapeutic interventions, have the greatest risk of developing a fatal infection.despite the availability of new antimicrobials and effective vaccines, community-acquired pneumonia remains a common and serious illness. in fact, it is a leading contributor to the nearly 4 million deaths occurring each year due to respiratory infections, especially in children from developing countries [1, 2] . the main causative agents of pneumonia differ according to the patient age and the geographic area. in addition, there are relatively few comprehensive studies on the specific aetiology of pneumonia [2] due to (i) overlaps in the clinical manifestations of the different syndromes, (ii) difficulties in establishing the precise aetiology, and (iii) frequent occurrence of co-infections. however, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), and parainfluenza virus type 3 (piv-3) have been identified as the main agents responsible for acute respiratory infections in children, whereas influenza virus related pneumonia is the leading cause of disease-related deaths in the elderly. in addition, the availability of new and more sensitive diagnostic tests have contributed to the identification of hitherto unknown lower respiratory pathogens, such as the human metapneumonovirus (hmpv) and novel coronaviruses causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars).significant efforts have been invested in the last two decades to develop new diagnostic tools, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and to understand host clearance mechanisms. this resulted in an improved knowledge on host responses to infection and immuno-pathogenesis, which in turn have facilitated the establishment of new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. however, despite our accomplishments in vaccine development, there are many pathogens for which vaccines or adequate therapies are not available or the existent ones are suboptimal.the main approach applied for vaccine development has radically changed in recent years. whole cell vaccines are systematically being replaced by subunit vaccines, in which purified antigens or their coding genes are exploited in combination with new adjuvants and/or delivery systems. as a result, many of the vaccines under development will exhibit consistently improved stability, safety and efficacy profiles. they will also be amenable for mucosal administration, thereby mimicking natural infections.influenza a viruses are the most commonly responsible for severe respiratory illness in humans, followed by influenza b. the population's susceptibly to infection is renewed annually, because of the rapid antigenic variation of this virus. the antigenic variation is due to the accumulation of point mutations in the two major surface glycoproteins of the virus, haemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na). this can lead to an antigenic drift of the virus, which often leaves current influenza vaccines outdated and ineffective. antigenic shift can also occur due to the segmented nature of the viral genome that favours the emergence of re-assorted strains, in which an entire glycoprotein can be acquired from a different animal influenza virus. both types of variation represent a critical bottleneck for the establishment of a robust vaccination strategy against influenza. in fact, when an influenza virus with the capacity to spread from person-to-person and a complete new glycoprotein subtype suddenly emerges, a worldwide pandemic outbreak can result [3] .the earliest vaccines against influenza were whole cell vaccines obtained in the 1940s by inactivating viruses grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated chicken eggs with formalin. while contemporary inactivated influenza vaccines are still produced in embryonated eggs, improvements in manufacturing have resulted in a highly purified and less-reactogenic detergentsplit product. three viral strains are selected on the basis of the previous year's surveillance data on the most prevalent subtypes, therefore, vaccine composition may vary from year-to-year. vaccination has a high benefit:cost ratio, since influenza-related illness (e.g., hospitalizations and deaths) are effectively prevented [1] .the world's total vaccine production is approximately 300 million doses, with a maximum capacity of 900 million doses. however, the world health organization (who) estimates that there are about 1.2 billion people at high risk for severe influenza outcomes (e.g., elderly over 65 years of age, infants, health care workers, children and adults with underlying cardiopulmonary disease). furthermore, the global infrastructure would not be able to handle the timely manufacturing and distribution of a vaccine for a pandemic outbreak [4] . one alternative would be to lower the quantity of antigen per dose and add adjuvants to the vaccine formulation, but this needs to be tested in clinical trials [5] . another solution would be to improve current vaccine production technologies (i.e., egg-derived vaccines). however, there is the limited number of egg producers and viral strains can emerge, which could not be easily adapted to embryonated eggs. to overcome these problems, several pharmaceutical companies have embarked themselves on projects for the development of vaccines produced by growing the virus on cell lines. the influenza virus can be adapted to grow on a variety of mammalian cell lines, including vero, per.c-6, and madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) cells [6] [7] [8] .this strategy would also improve the possibility of up-scaling vaccine production in face of a pandemic spread. alternatively, it would be possible to develop a vaccine against any influenza virus, such as the avian h5n1 strain, by using reverse genetics techniques [9] (see below in advances in vaccinology).cold adaptation was found to be a reliable and efficient procedure for the derivation of live attenuated viral vaccine strains for humans. cold-adapted (ca) virus strains can grow in primary chick kidney cells or embryonated eggs at 25-33°c, however, they exhibit a reduced replication at 37°c. the process of genetic re-assortment with the transfer of the six internal genes from a stable attenuated ca master donor strain of influenza a or b to the new prevailing wild-type epidemic strain has been used to generate attenuated cold-reassorted vaccines with the proper level of attenuation, genetic stability and immunogenicity, which show low or absent transmissibility [10] . medimmune and wyeth have developed along these lines a trivalent live ca vaccine (flumist) for intranasal spray delivery, which was licensed in 2003. in contrast, to parenterally-administered vaccines, this formulation triggers immune responses resembling those observed after natural infections [11] . despite the moderate hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titres observed in vacinees, flumist showed 92% efficacy over a 2-year period in children, including protection against antigenic variants that circulated during the second year [12] [13] [14] . this ca vaccine also stimulated the production of nasal iga, as well as t-cell and interferon responses [15] . the cell-mediated immunity against virus matrix and nucleoprotein antigens may favour viral clearance and early recovery from illness [3] . the advisory committee on immunization practices has recommended its use only in persons from 5 to 49 years of age, since side-effects were observed in young children (wheezing, nasal congestion) and there are no data available for elderly [16, 17] . despite its remarkable genetic stability, this vaccine has to be kept at -18°c. thus, a new heat stable derivative has recently been developed, which showed good efficacy in clinical trials [1] . a live vaccine based on a master virus strain developed at the institute of applied microbiology (austria) by growing wild influenza virus in vero cells at 25°c was also demonstrated to be safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic after intranasal immunization in young adults [18].a number of subunit-or dna-based vaccines are also in various stages of development. an influenza vaccine formulated in virosomes has been commercialized by berna biotech (inflexal ® v); it contains the surface spikes of the three currently circulating influenza virus strains inserted in vesicle membranes of the three corresponding virus types (for more details see section "pseudoviruses as antigen delivery systems") [19] . this company has also developed a virosome-based nasal formulation. however, it was withdrawn from the market due to the presence of sideeffects (i.e., bell's palsy), which was assumed to be linked to the presence of the escherichia coli heat labile toxin (lt) as adjuvant. two companies, yeda and bionvax, are also developing a peptide-based influenza vaccine for nasal administration, which showed protective efficacy in humanized mice [1] . a subunit vaccine containing recombinant ha protein produced using a baculovirus system was successfully tested in a phase ii trial in 64 to 89-year-old volunteers. an epidermal dna-based influenza vaccine, which contained the ha gene from a/panama/2007/99 delivered by particle-mediated epidermal delivery was also tested in humans by powderject [20] . serum haemagglutination-inhibition antibody responses were observed in volunteers receiving a single dose of 1, 2 or 4 g of dna, with the strongest and most consistent responses in subjects vaccinated with the highest dosage.some immunization approaches aim at the development of a universal vaccine with a broad spectrum of protective activity against different influenza strains [21]. among them, the use of the highly conserved transmembrane m2 protein of the virion can be mentioned. a recombinant particulate vaccine has been engineered by genetically fusing copies of the m2 to the hepatitis b core antigen (hbc). the m2-hbc fusion protein spontaneously assembled into virus-like particles (vlp), which provided complete protection against a lethal challenge with influenza virus a in mice [22, 23] . promising results were also obtained after vaccination with a m2 peptide conjugated with a neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein complex (ompc) in monkeys [24] .the human piv (hpiv) consist of four serotypes, with hpiv-3 being the second leading cause of bronchitis and pneumonia in infants. no vaccine has been licensed to date against piv, however, several approaches are currently under investigation. the initial attempts to provide protection by using vaccines based on formalin-inactivated viruses failed. subsequent work demonstrated that the glycoproteins haemagglutininneuraminidase (hn) and f, which are responsible for virus attachment and fusion, are able to stimulate the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies in animals. however, their poor immunogenicity in naïve subjects led to the currently favoured approach, which is based on the use of live attenuated piv.live attenuated piv vaccines have been developed from both human and bovine strains, which are amenable for delivery by the intranasal route. candidate vaccines should be able to replicate and induce a protective immune response in young infants, even in the presence of maternally acquired antibodies. two main attenuated strains have been studied in detail. one is the hpiv-3 strain cp45, which was selected after 45 passages of the virus in african green monkey cells at low temperature. the other is a bovine piv (bpiv)-3 strain, which is antigenically related to the hpiv-3, and replicates poorly in humans. both cp45 and bpiv-3 have been evaluated in phase i/ii trials in sero-positive and sero-negative children and in young infants. they were found to be over-attenuated in sero-positive children, but immunogenic in sero-negative children and infants [25] . however, the magnitude of the anti-hn response was lower in children who received the bpiv-3 vaccine [25]. this prompted the engineering of chimeric bovine/human piv-3 candidates (e.g., hpiv-nb strain in which the human nucleocapsid is replaced by the bovine counterpart, or a bpiv-3 strain that expresses the f and hn proteins of hpiv-3). attenuated, chimeric viruses that contain piv-3 cp45 internal genes with the f and hn genes from either piv-1 or piv-2 have also been tested in hamsters [26] . berna biotech is also developing a virosomal formulation of the piv-3 [1] .using the successful approach of the influenza vaccine, a formalin-inactivated candidate against the respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) was tested in children in the 1960s. the consequence was the hospitalization of 80% of vaccinees and two deaths [1] . moreover, vaccinated children also suffered more severe disease on subsequent exposure to the virus, as compared to unvaccinated controls [27] . this demonstrated that the elicitation of a strong immune response is not sufficient to confer protection against disease, and can even lead to immuno-pathological reactions. thus, it is essential to stimulate the "right" type of immune response. in the particular case of rsv, host responses play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease, thereby making the development of a preventive vaccine extremely difficult. in addition, naturally acquired immunity to rsv is neither complete nor long-lasting, and recurrent infections often occur [28] . however, older children and adults are usually protected, suggesting that protection against severe disease develops after several consecutive infections. passive immunization with rsv-neutralizing immune globulins was also shown to prevent rsv infection in newborns with underlying cardiopulmonary disease [29] . this demonstrates that antibodies play a major role in protection against this disease, whereas t-cell immunity targeted to internal viral proteins appears to contribute to clearance.although live attenuated vaccines seem to be preferable for immunization of naïve infants, subunit vaccines may be of choice for elderly, high-risk children and pregnant women. candidate subunit vaccines based on purified f proteins (pfp-1, -2 and -3) were demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic, even during pregnancy [30] . maternal immunization using a pfp-based vaccine could be an interesting strategy to protect infants younger than 6 months of age [25] . however, no significant protection was reported in a phase iii trial performed on children 1-12 years of age with cystic fibrosis after vaccination with a subunit vaccine based on pfp-3 [31] . a formulation based on surface glycoproteins f and g together with the virion matrix protein m from rsv-a was tested in healthy adult volunteers in the presence of either alum or polyphosphazene as an adjuvant. short-live neutralizing antibody responses to rsv-a and rsv-b were detected in 76-93% of the vaccinees, suggesting that annual boosting will be needed [32] [33] [34] . the central domain of the g protein of rsv-a is relatively conserved among viruses from the groups a and b. thus, a recombinant vaccine candidate, bbg2na, was developed by fusing the g2na domain to the albumin binding region of streptococcal protein g. this candidate was shown to be moderate immunogenic in adult human volunteers, but its clinical development was interrupted due to the appearance of purpura in vaccinees [1] .the main two difficulties associated with the generation of live attenuated vaccines against rsv are over-or under-attenuation of the virus and limited genetic stability. temperature-sensitive (ts), ca and cold-passaged (cp) mutant viral strains have been generated. despite the attenuation shown in adults and sero-positive children, cpts mutants still caused moderate congestion in the upper respiratory tract of sero-negative infants (1-2 months old) [35] . recombinant rsv vaccines with deletions in non essential genes (e.g., sh, ns1 or ns2), which also carry cp and ts mutations in essential genes are currently being evaluated [1] . through recombinant dna technology chimeric viruses were engineered, which contain the genes of hpiv-3 surface glycoproteins f and nh together with those of rsv glycoproteins f and g in a bpiv-3 genetic background. one of these candidates was found to be attenuated and able to induce the elicitation of immune responses against both hpiv-3 and rsv in rhesus monkeys [36] . similarly, a bpiv-3 genome was engineered to express hpiv-3 f and hn proteins and either native or soluble rsv f protein [37] . the resulting strain, which induced rsv neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against rsv challenge in african green monkeys, needs to be tested for safety and efficacy against rsv and piv-3 in infants.this emerging disease was originally described in the guangdong province of china in 2002. even when the global outbreak of sars was under control in 2003, new infections were reported in persons who had contacts with animals in 2003 and 2004 [38] . the typical sars-cov-like virus is not transmitted from animals to humans. however, under certain conditions the virus can evolve into the early human sars-cov, which has the ability to be transmitted from animals to humans or even humans to humans, thereby leading to localized outbreaks of mild disease. the early human sars-cov, under selective pressure in humans, may further evolve into the late human sars-cov, which can cause local or global outbreaks of typical sars [39] .sars can be easily grown in cell cultures [38] . thus, there is an urgent need for vaccines, not only to prevent naturally occurring epidemic outbreaks, but also as a tool against the threat of biological weapons. several structural proteins are expressed by sars-cov, including nucleocapsid, envelope and spike (s) proteins [38] . the latter is a type i trans-membrane glycoprotein, which is responsible for virus binding, fusion and entry, and being the major target of neutralizing antibodies [38, 40] . the extracelullar domain of the s protein consists of two subunits, s1 and s2 [40] . the s1 subunit possess a receptor-binding domain (rbd), which is responsible for viral binding to one of its receptors [41, 42] . vector-based vaccines expressing the s protein, as well as dna vaccines encoding full-length s protein have been assessed in preclinical studies [43, 44] . when modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) coding for full-length s protein was administered by either intranasal or intramuscular route, neutralizing antibodies were elicited [45] . however, vaccination of ferrets resulted in liver damage after challenge, raising some concerns about the safety of this approach [46] .vaccines formulated using different synthetic peptides encompassing linear b cell epitopes from the s protein, which were identified using sera from convalescent patients, stimulated high antibody titres. nevertheless, none of them triggered the elicitation of neutralizing activity. on the other hand, some studies demonstrated that although antibodies against s protein of the late sars-cov (urbani strain) exhibit neutralizing activity, they can also enhance infection by an early human sars-cov isolate (gd03t0013) and the civet sars-cov-like viruses. a derivative of the s protein with a truncation at amino acid (aa) 1153 fails to cause antibody dependent enhancement of infection, but retains the ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. these findings suggest that the elimination of the putative heptad repeated 2 (hr2, aa 1153-1194), which is implicated in viral fusion, might abrogate the stimulation of virus infection-enhancing antibodies [47, 48] . the use of the nucleoprotein of the coronavirus in a dna vaccination protocol also led to the stimulation of a protective response [49] . in contrast, protection was not achieved when a recombinant piv-3 expressing the nucleoprotein alone or together with the matrix protein was used [50] . this demonstrates that the selection of the delivery system and immunization strategy play a critical role in vaccine efficacy.the human adenoviruses are divided into six subgroups (a-f). the adenovirus can cause large-scale epidemics of acute respiratory disease, and dissemination is especially favoured under conditions in which persons are housed communally. the subgroup a viruses, such as ad31, have been associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised patients. neutralizing antibodies directed against the capsid (hexon and fiber proteins) seems to be the main effector mechanism to prevent re-infections by adenovirus [3] . until 1998, military recruits in usa were administered enteric-coated capsules containing live viruses from the serotypes 4 and 7. the virus, which was not attenuated if delivered by respiratory route, was able to replicate in the gastrointestinal tract without causing disease, thereby stimulating protective responses in the respiratory tract [51] . when the vaccine went out of production, outbreaks of respiratory diseases caused by adenovirus reemerged among the military recruits [3] . since serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 5 cause the 80% of adenovirus associated respiratory disease in young children, the development of a tetravalent vaccine similar to the above mentioned might solve the problem in children [52] . however, the implementation of a vaccine (live or attenuated) against adenovirus should be carefully evaluated, since recombinant adenoviruses are proposed both as vaccine vectors and as tools for the transfer of foreign genes in gene therapy protocols.polysaccharide-based vaccines against s. pneumoniaein 1945, macleod et al. [53] reported the protective efficacy of a capsular polysaccharide (ps) vaccine in military personnel during an outbreak of pneumococcal pneumonia. the immunization with purified ps showed a drastically reduced reactogenicity, in comparison with the previously used inactivated whole cell vaccines. this was a major breakthrough, not only in terms of safety, but also because it demonstrated that a specific virulence factor can be purified and effectively implemented for the prevention of an infectious disease, thereby paving the road for modern non toxoid-based subunit vaccines.although the serological correlates of immunity are poorly defined, type-specific anti-capsular antibodies are responsible for protective immu-nity. however, immunity is serotype specific, rendering extremely difficult the development of a universal vaccine. this is in part due to the elevate number of serotypes, the regional variations in dominant serotypes and the lack of updated sero-prevalence data for certain regions. these problems have been partially solved by the use of ps-based polyvalent vaccines. the currently licensed formulations contain 23 serotypes of s. pneumoniae, which cover approximately 90% of serious pneumococcal disease, but only in western industrialized countries. relatively good antibody responses (60-70%) are elicited in healthy adults 2-3 weeks after a single intramuscular or subcutaneous immunization [54] . unfortunately, they are poorly immunogenic in children aged less than 2 years, in immune compromised individuals (e.g., aids patients) and in elderly people with concomitant disease, and they do not induce good immunological memory. randomized controlled trials in healthy elderly and young men also failed to show a beneficial effect against pneumonia [55] . however, vaccination is recommended for healthy people over 65 years of age to confer protection against invasive disease [54] . ps-based vaccines can be also used in pregnant women to stimulate the production of antibodies, which are transferred to the foetus via the placenta or to the newborns by breast-feeding. however, it is still a matter of controversy whether maternal vaccination can indeed protect newborns against pneumococcal infections [56] .the second generation of ps-based conjugate vaccines stimulates stronger antibody responses, even in infants, young children and immune deficient individuals, as well as immunological memory. these vaccines also suppress nasopharyngeal carriage of the pathogen and reduce bacterial transmission in the community leading to herd immunity, which adds considerable value to their implementation. the introduction of these vaccines in usa in 2000 resulted in a dramatic decline in the rates of invasive pneumococcal disease [1, 57, 58] . a significant reduction in the incidence rates among non vaccinated individuals was also observed as a result of herd immunity [59, 60] . however, the licensed seven-valent vaccine does not contain some of serotypes that cause severe disease in developing countries (i.e., serotypes 1 and 5). new conjugate vaccines including more serotypes, such as the ninevalent vaccine (wyeth) and two 11-valent vaccines (glaxosmithkline and sanofi-pasteur), should provide better serotype coverage.new approaches to develop protein-based subunit vaccines against s. pneumoniae are currently being pursued by different research groups. this is expected to enable the generation of a universal vaccine conferring protective immunity against a large number of serotypes, as well as to avoid the complexity of manufacturing a conjugate vaccine [61] . there are different pneumococcal candidate antigens, such as the pneumolysin, neuraminidase, autolysin, pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) and adhesin a (psaa), which are in an early phase of clinical development [1] . in addition, several promising candidates have been identified, which are currently being tested in pre-clinical experimental models [1] . among them, the two iron uptake abc transporters of s. pneumoniae (piaa and piua), which trigger protective immunity against invasive pneumococcal disease in mice. through the screening of s. pneumoniae genomic expression libraries with sera from convalescent patients, bacterial surface proteins were identified (e.g., bvh-3 and bvh-11) that promote the elicitation of protective anti-pneumococcal antibodies in mice [1] . a recombinant hybrid protein, bvh3/11v, has successfully been tested in toddlers and elderly volunteers. this candidate vaccine should be able to trigger serotype-independent responses, since the bvh3 and bvh11 antigens are common to all serotypes of s. pneumoniae.the major obstacle for developing an effective vaccine against h. influenzae capsular ps was related to the inherently poor immunogenicity of this t-cell-independent antigen. antibody responses against ps are age-related, with extremely poor immunogenicity in infants during the first 18 months of life. unfortunately, this age group exhibits the highest risk for invasive infections caused by h. influenzae. a ps-based vaccine against the h. influenzae type b (hib) was licensed in the united states in 1985, for children more than 18 months old [62, 63] . the protective efficacy after licensure studies showed the inefficacy of this vaccine not only in infants, but also in older children [64] . this problem was solved by the generation of a conjugate hib vaccine. to this end, the hib ps (i.e., polyribosylribitol phosphate; prp) was covalently linked to an immunogenic carrier protein, thereby leading to t-cell-dependent responses against the ps. different conjugate hib vaccines currently exist. these vaccines are hboc, prp-t and prp-omp, which make use of the mutant diphtheria toxin crm197, the tetanus toxoid and the outer membrane protein from group b n. meningitidis as carriers, respectively. all of them trigger similar immune responses at the recommended doses. however, the dynamic of the elicited response may vary for each of them [65, 66] .efficacy studies of these vaccines showed that they confer protection not only against meningitis, but also against pneumonia [67] [68] [69] . although hib vaccines are highly effective, their cost is still prohibitive for the world's poorest nations. however, with the establishment of the global alliance for vaccines and immunization (gavi), we have moved consistently ahead in making them also available for developing countries. gavi has approved the establishment of a hib initiative to support countries wishing to sustain hib vaccination, as well as those exploring whether their introduction could be considered a priority in the near future.although the introduction of conjugated ps vaccines has significantly decreased the prevalence of invasive hib disease, paediatric infections due to non typeable h. influenzae (nthi) are still highly prevalent. nthi is most often associated with otitis media, sinusitis and bronchitis. in addition, nthi is an important cause of lower respiratory infection in adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). thus, the development of a vaccine against nthi is considered an important goal in public health. in contrast to hib, vaccines against the non-encapsulated nthi strains must be directed against alternative virulence factors. the lipoproteins d and p6 are widely distributed and antigenically conserved among h. influenzae strains, and also trigger the elicitation of protective immunity in animals vaccinated by mucosal route [70] [71] [72] [73] . thus, their incorporation in vaccine candidates might facilitate the generation of a universal vaccine against all typeable and non typeable h. influenzae.even in the age of vaccine availability, b. pertussis continues to be a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality (i.e., approximately 50 million cases and 300,000 deaths occur annually worldwide). since the late 1940s, the incidence of whooping cough has dramatically decreased in most developed countries, as a result of widespread immunization. the first vaccine formulations, which are still in use, consist of preparations based on killed b. pertussis. the frequent incidence of minor adverse effects (e.g., fever, protracted crying and local erythematous reactions), as well as concerns raised by reports of serious neurological side-effects, resulted in a decline in vaccine acceptance and use [74] . this in turn led to a re-emergence of whooping cough and its complications. this serious problem prompted the development of a new generation of acellular vaccines.in 1981 japan was the first country to successfully introduce acellular vaccines against whooping cough in its immunisation programme [75] , leading to a consistent reduction in the reported side-effects. in the mid 1980's a major phase iii trial of acellular vaccines was undertaken in sweden, at a time when the banning of the whole cell vaccine had resulted in a pertussis epidemic in that country [76] . the first vaccine trials contained chemically detoxified pertussis toxin (pt) and filamentous haemagglutinin (fha), or detoxified pt alone. the results of these trials showed that whilst producing good antibody responses, the vaccines failed to give an adequate level of protection in infants. the mono-component vaccine conferred no protection against infection, whereas the use of the two component candidate only gave incomplete protection against infection [77] . the results obtained in japan and sweden stimulated vaccine companies in the usa and europe to establish vigorous research programmes aimed at the development of a new generation of acellular vaccines with higher efficacy. currently available vaccines have incorporated chemically or genetically inactivated pt and additional virulence factors, such as fha, the outer membrane protein pertactin (prn) and fimbrial proteins (fims).the efficacy studies of this second generation of acellular vaccines have demonstrated that they confer levels of protection equivalent to the whole cell vaccines. the advent of improved techniques for antigenic characterisation and the introduction of acellular vaccines containing genetically defined components also resulted in a reduction of lot-to-lot variation in comparison with conventional whole cell vaccines and the acellular formulation originally introduced in japan. however, despite the wide implementation of vaccination campaigns in infants and children, the disease continues to be endemic. in addition, in countries with high vaccine coverage we are now observing a consistent increment in the cases of pertussis in adolescents and adults [78] [79] [80] . these patients can then transmit the disease to infants, thereby now representing a primary reservoir for bacterial transmission and cycling in the community.the above-mentioned observations can be explained by one or more of the following factors: (i) improved detection techniques, (ii) major awareness on the possibility that bacteria may affect these age groups, (iii) vaccinedriven antigenic changes in circulating isolates, and (iv) reduction in vaccine efficacy over time. in this context, concerns have been raised about genetic variation between the strains used for vaccine preparation and circulating isolates. this seems to be true, since the currently used whole cell and acellular vaccines are prepared with strains that were isolated before mass vaccine introduction and show clear mismatches with respect to circulating strains. there is a steady tendency to decrease diversity in recent isolates, together with clonal expansion during epidemic outbreaks [81, 82] . over time, at least two surface proteins (pt and prn) may have changed sufficiently to allow for an increase in the incidence of disease. unfortunately, our global information on antigenic variation and disease in adults and adolescent is extremely limited. thus, despite widespread introduction of pertussis vaccines, it is essential to continue surveillance studies and collection of circulating strains. the present view is that successful control of pertussis in the community may require routine immunization of adolescents and adults with the new acellular vaccines, perhaps in combination with the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (dtap). this intervention might help in turn to reduce the burden of disease and transmission to infants.chlamydia pneumonia is an intracellular bacterium transmitted person-toperson via respiratory droplets. this pathogen is a common cause of pneumonia, with infections usually being oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic in young age groups. however, the rate of asymptomatic carriage in the normal population is unknown. there is also a tremendous gap in our understanding of host response to infections caused by c. pneumoniae. most of the studies have been focused on the development of efficient diagnostic methods. however, less work has been done on vaccine development, and there is a paucity of knowledge on the microbial components which may serve as target antigens. in fact, at present there are no licensed vaccines against c. pneumoniae. however, the potential of different antigens, such as the major omp2 [83] have been assessed in experimental animal models. nevertheless, mice vaccinated with omp2 using a protocol based on priming with dna and boosting with recombinant vlp showed only partial protection [84] . recent studies also suggested that ctl responses play a role in protection and clearance [85] . animals immunized with a mini-gene encoding seven h-2(b)-restricted ctl epitopes fused to a endothelial reticulum-translocation signal showed protection following intranasal challenge with a virulent c. pneumoniae [85] .the current view is that multi-component vaccine will be required in order to induce a protective response [86] . using the promising approach of reverse vaccinology combined with proteomics (see section "reverse vaccinology"), the whole-genome of c. pneumoniae was screened searching for vaccine candidate antigens among exposed and immune accessible surface proteins [87] . the selected candidates were then expressed in a heterologous system and used in immunization studies. approximately 53 proteins were able to trigger the elicitation of c. pneumoniae-binding antibodies. when tested in secondary screenings, six of them were also able to neutralize bacteria in vitro, and four inhibited systemic dissemination of c. pneumoniae in a hamster model [86] .moraxella catarrhalis is the third most common bacterial etiologic agent of otitis media in children. furthermore, m. catarrhalis is an important cause of respiratory infections in patients with copd. thus, different studies have been carried out to characterize potential protective antigens. in this context, two major omp (cd and e) have been identified, which are considered prime candidate antigens for vaccine development. these proteins are expressed on the surface and show a high degree of conservation among circulating strains. both omp triggered the elicitation of bactericidal antibodies and protective immunity in preclinical models [88] . additional candidates are the uspa1 protein [89] , which seems to be required for bacterial colonization of the human upper respiratory tract, the iron-induced omp b1 and lbp, and the iron-repressed omp b2 [90] . a conjugate vaccine based on detoxified lipo-oligosaccharide was also tested in mice by intranasal route with encouraging results [91, 92] . some of these candidates are planned to be tested in clinical studies soon [90] .mycoplasmas are commensal microorganisms, as well as opportunistic pathogens. mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the causative agents of acute and chronic human respiratory diseases and the main responsible for primary atypical pneumonia, accounting for approximately 20-30% of all community-acquired pneumonia [93] . there is a considerable underreporting for m. pneumoniae-associated diseases. this is in part due to the wide diversity of clinical manifestations, the difficulties associated with its cultivation from clinical specimens and the lack of adequate diagnostic tools. no vaccines are currently available against this pathogen. however, studies conducted in human volunteers in the late 1960s demonstrated that a formalin-inactivated whole cell vaccine and an acellular extract were able to confer moderately protective immunity against m. pneumoniae [94] . unfortunately, immune pathological reactions were observed following challenge with live organisms. therefore, studies are still needed to understand the underlying mechanisms to the observed autoimmune responses [95] . more specifically, we need to elucidate the specific role played by humoral and cellular response in protection against m. pneumoniae. m. pneumoniae is one of the smallest self-replicating prokaryotic pathogens (approximately 800 kb). the complete genome sequence is now available. this is expected to expand our knowledge on the physiological and virulence properties of this agent, as well as new hints for vaccine development.a previously unrecognized bacterium was isolated after the outbreak of legionnaires disease in 1976, which was designated legionella pneumophila [96, 97] . the spreading of l. pneumophila is increasing due to the use of air-conditioners and humidifiers, since infections can occur by inhalation of aerosolized contaminated water sources. several approaches have been developed in the fight against this facultative intracellular pathogen. infection and immunization induce a rapid increase of antibody titres. however, antibodies do not seem to play a significant role in host resistance, particularly after aerosol challenge [98] [99] [100] . some authors also suggested that these antibodies can promote bacterial phagocytosis, thereby favouring invasion and subsequent intracellular replication [101] . in contrast, cellular responses appear to be important for protection. different vaccine candidates were tested in the past. heat-, acetone-and formalin-killed l. pneumophila vaccines were not able to confer protective immunity in guinea pigs, whereas animals immunized with l. pneumophila membranes survive an aerosol challenge with virulent bacteria [98, 99] . additional work demonstrated that also purified antigens, such as the major secretory protein [98] , the major cytoplasmatic membrane protein [102] , the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein [103] , omps [104] and flagella [100] can confer protection against challenge with virulent l. pneumophila. finally, different live attenuated mutants of l. pneumophila were used in animal infection models with promising results [105] .cystic fibrosis (cf) patients are particularly susceptible to severe bacterial infections of the lung, being pseudomonas aeruginosa one of the most prominent etiologic agents. thus, significant efforts have been invested to develop a vaccine against this pathogen. surface ps are among the antigens that were most intensively assessed. berna biotech have developed an octavalent vaccine against the eight most prevalent serotypes based on o-ps conjugated with the exotoxin a [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] . a consistent reduction in the number of cf patients with chronic p. aeruginosa lung infection was observed in a cohort receiving the basic immunization protocol, followed by yearly boosters over a period of 10 years [112, 113] . the conjugate vaccine induced the production of specific igg antibodies and increased the number of igg memory b cells. it is still unclear if cellular responses might contribute to the overall protection conferred by this vaccine. however, strong proliferative responses of lymphocytes with a th1 phenotype were observed in vaccinated individuals in response to the carrier exotoxin a protein [113] . alternative vaccination strategies are currently being tested in clinical trials. among them, formulations based on a fusion protein between the outer membrane proteins f and i, which have been administered by parenteral and mucosal routes [114, 115] . these formulations were demonstrated to be safe in volunteers and conferred increased protection against p. aeruginosa in cf patients. cell-surface alginate, flagella, components of the type iii secretion system, inactivated toxins and proteases are other proposed target antigens [116] . some of them are already in clinical trials alone or in combination [116] .when pasteur returned from his summer holidays in 1881 to continue with his studies on chicken cholera, he inoculated chickens with an old culture of pasteurella multocida, which was left during the whole summer on his bench. the animals that received the preparation were protected against a challenge performed with a fresh isolate. thus, pasteur developed the hypothesis that pathogens could be attenuated by exposure to environmental insults (e.g., high temperature, oxygen and chemicals) [117] . the strategy was then successfully extrapolated for developing anthrax vaccines in livestock in the 1880s, with significant economic benefits. this was followed by the generation of attenuated vaccines against rabies and other important pathogens towards the end of the nineteenth century. pasteur's approach for "attenuating" or "inactivating" a pathogenic organisms still constitutes a cornerstone in vaccine technology [117] . this exemplifies that until recently the major achievements in vaccinology have been facilitated by technological (e.g., adjuvants, delivery systems, reverse vaccinology, genetic engineering) rather than immunological advances [117] [118] [119] . however, it is expected that the impressive knowledge accumulated in recent years in the fields of immunology, immune pathology and microbial pathogenesis will pave the road to a new golden era in vaccinology, in which knowledge and technology will enable rational vaccine design.in the 20th century, pertussis vaccines progressed from crude bacterial preparations to the highly purified antigens used for acellular vaccines. a similar quantum jump in technology allowed the development of subunit vaccines against influenza, hib and s. pneumoniae, as well as the production of antigens by recombinant dna techniques (e.g., genetically inactivated pt). despite the fact that these techniques enable the production of almost any foreseeable antigen, the identification of suitable targets still remained as a main bottleneck for vaccine development [120] .the advent of genomics and its exploitation in the vaccinology field have rendered possible the implementation of a systematic and holistic approach for the screening, identification and prioritisation of candidate antigens. this new approach, called "reverse vaccinology" [121] , does not require cultivation of the original pathogen, thereby being amenable for highlypathogenic or non culturable micro-organisms. it is possible to predict and select the most promising candidates by the analysis of genomic sequences in silico, which will then be cloned and expressed in heterologous systems. the resulting proteins are then used to perform immunological and/or functional studies to select the most promising candidates (e.g., able to induce the production of microbicidal or neutralizing antibodies, capacity to confer protective immunity). flanking studies are usually carried out, such as molecular epidemiological analysis to assess their degree of conservation among circulating strains, or transcriptional profiling to evaluate their expression during natural infections [122] .the time-consuming process in which highly expressed components of an in vitro cultivable organism are identified (one at a time) and separated (different components between them) is one of the disadvantages that reverse vaccinology has solved. the conventional method usually requires 15-20 years to arrive to a clinical trial, whereas reverse vaccinology reduces the process to approximately 5 years. reverse vaccinology also allows the identification of hundreds of potential candidates in a few days, in comparison with the small number of antigens that conventional approaches have provided after decades of research. moreover, reverse vaccinology offers the possibility to select potential candidates independent of their expression levels or purification easiness.the reverse vaccinology approach has proved its usefulness in the field for both viral and bacterial pathogens (e.g. hepatitis c virus, group b meningococci, group b streptococci) [123, 124] . reverse vaccinology has also become an essential tool for several vaccine development projects against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia (e.g., c. pneumoniae, streptococci). the potential and speed of genomic-based approaches was also shown when the nucleotide sequence of the coronavirus causing sars was made available in less than one month. in addition, the increasing number of available genomes from bacteria and viruses would allow comparative genomic studies, thereby providing hints on conserved protein families and/or functional domains. this would facilitate the generation of vaccines using immunogens covering multiple micro-organisms [125] . despite the incredible potential of reverse vaccinology, this approach also has some important limitations (tab. 1). among them is the fact that it is not be possible to identify non-protein antigens (e.g., ps, glycolipids), which are the cornerstone for many successful vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal and hib vaccines).currently available influenza vaccines (see above) are based on inactivated viruses, and, more recently, attenuated ca viruses and virosomes. all these vaccines exploit the same starting material (wild-type virus), which is inactivated or attenuated. the last approach consists in the co-infection of chicken eggs with the new isolate and a master attenuated strain, and subsequent selection for re-assorted viruses with the desired genotype/phenotype. however, the virulence of certain virus strains, such as the h5n1, renders difficult the implementation of this traditional strategy. the use of reverse genetics represents a valid alternative for the generation of vaccines against rna respiratory viruses, such as the influenza virus, piv and rsv. it consists in the production of the virus from cloned dna [126] , thereby allowing the development of vaccines against any pandemic viral strain. in some cases (e.g., avian h5n1) an additional mutagenesis step would be required to attenuate its virulence [127] . then, the new ha and na segments would be transferred into an appropriate influenza a virus master strain adapted to grow in a cell line. the final re-assorted virus will have the antigenic specificity of the pandemic strain and the growth characteristics of the master strain [128, 129] .this technology would also allow production of the influenza vaccine in cells that are co-transfected with plasmids encoding for different frag- [130] . therefore, the complete genome is inside the cell and virus can be produced and assembled. one of the main advantages is that a plasmid encoding for ha and na can be easily replaced. therefore, re-assortment and selection become unnecessary. this method would considerably reduce the time for vaccine production, from many months to only a few weeks. another advantage would be the simple manipulation of the genome (contained in plasmids), which would enable detoxification of specific virulence factors. similar approaches can be implemented for other viruses, such as rsv, piv and sars-cov. however, intellectual property and liability issues are still obstacles for the industrial development of reverse-genetics-based vaccines [131] . furthermore, since the resulting viruses are considered genetically modified organisms, additional problems may arise from the regulatory stand point [131] .most of the infective agents are either limited to the mucosal membranes, or need to transit across them in order to cause disease. therefore, it is highly desirable to elicit an efficient immune response at the local site in which the first line of defence is laid. the stimulation of a pathogen-specific response at the portal of entry is expected to impair infection (i.e. colonization), thereby reducing the risk of transmission to susceptible hosts. parenterally administered vaccines mainly stimulate systemic responses, whereas vaccines given by the mucosal route mimic natural infections, thereby leading to efficient mucosal and systemic responses. thus, there is a considerable interest in the development of mucosal vaccines. however, antigens administered by this route are usually poorly immunogenic. different strategies are being pursued to overcome this bottleneck, among them can be cited the use of (i) advanced synthetic delivery systems, (ii) live attenuated bacterial or viral vectors, (iii) bacterial ghosts, (iv) pseudoviruses and (v) mucosal adjuvants [132] [133] [134] [135] .advanced synthetic mucosal delivery systems particulate antigens are more immunogenic than those in solution, due to their vulnerability to degradation by enzymes and extreme ph. thus, it would be helpful to incorporate them into a protective vehicle. often, these vehicles do not serve only to protect them, but can also enhance their uptake, promote targeting to antigen presenting cells and serve as adjuvants [136] . the most commonly exploited delivery systems are: (i) gelatine capsules, which are dissolved at alkaline ph in the intestine but not in the stomach, (ii) muco-adhesive polymers that are highly viscous inert ps, (iii) eldexomer and carboxymethyl cellulose, which have been used for oral, nasal and vaginal delivery, (iv) lipid-based structures with entrapped antigens, such as immune stimulating complexes (iscoms) and liposomes, and (v) biodegradable micro/nano-spheres based on biocompatible materials such as starch, copolymers of lactic or glycolic acid [137, 138] . some of these approaches are currently being explored to develop vaccines against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia.encouraging results have been obtained, among others, using surface antigens from s. pneumoniae encapsulated in micro-spheres [139] and a iscom-adjuvanted vaccine obtained by reverse genetics against the influenza virus, in preclinical models [140] .attenuated viruses and bacteria can be used not only as vaccine candidates per se, but also as delivery systems for heterologous antigens. thus, many attenuated microorganisms have been exploited as a scaffold for the development of subunit vaccines against other agents, under the premise that the expression of the recombinant antigen(s) does not increase their pathogenic potential for humans or animals. the most frequently exploited bacterial vectors are attenuated derivatives of salmonella enterica and shigella spp., and the bacille calmette-guérin (bcg). for example, vaccination with an attenuated salmonella expressing the oprf-opri was also shown to be able to confer protection against p. aeruginosa in a murine experimental infection model [141] . in addition, it was also demonstrated that a recombinant bcgbased vaccine expressing the pspa confers protection against s. pneumoniae in an infection animal model [142] . the use of commensals represents an alternative to attenuated organisms (e.g., lactobacilli). in this context it was demonstrated that oral administration of lactobacillus expressing proteins from coronavirus can protect against a gastric infection [143] . thus, this approach has been also proposed to combat sars. promising results were also obtained using x chlamydia psittaci [144] . on the other hand, different attenuated viruses, such as mva, bovine or attenuated hpiv-3 and adenovirus can be used as delivery systems for heterologous antigens [25, 145] . in fact, mva has recently been exploited for antigens of the sars associated coronavirus [146] .an alternative approach to the use of live attenuated carriers is given by the use of bacterial ghosts. ghosts are generated by the conditional expression of the lethal lysis gene e from bacteriophage phix174 in gram-negative bacteria [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] . this leads to the formation of a trans-membrane tunnel through the bacterial cellular envelope [147] . due to the high internal osmotic pressure, the cytoplasm content is expelled through the tunnel, thereby leading to an empty bacterial cell envelope [152] . the presence of envelope components in the ghosts provides a strong danger signal through the activation of pattern recognition receptors [153] . in addition, bacterial ghosts are efficiently taken up by antigen-presenting cells, stimulating their maturation and activation [154] . bacterial ghosts retain all morphological, structural, and antigenic features of the cell wall and can be used as vaccine candidates per se. ghosts can also be externally loaded with purified antigens. alternatively, ghosts can be generated from recombinant bacteria expressing heterologous antigens, hence avoiding the difficulties associated with the purification steps. this technology also offers the possibility to manipulate the topology of the recombinant antigen (e.g., the antigen can be bound to the inner membrane, secreted into the periplasmic space or associated to the surface). encouraging results has been obtained in preclinical models using ghosts expressing chlamydial antigens [135, 155] .promising results have been reported using different types of pseudoviruses, such as virosomes and virus-like particles (vlp), which are non-replicating viral-like structures. virosomes are based on the principle of reconstituting empty viral envelopes through integration of viral envelope proteins in liposomes. they offer the versatility of liposomes in terms of lipid composition, with the advantage of including viral membrane proteins. virosomes are produced by disassembling the viral membrane envelope with detergents. then, the viral nucleocapsid is removed by ultracentrifugation before reconstitution (fig. 1) . in contrast, vlp exploit the capacity of recombinant viral coat proteins to spontaneously self-assemble, thereby mimicking at structural level the viral capsid. vlp can be isolated after protein expression in eukaryotic cells or by in vitro assemblage from subunits produced in an heterologous system [156] . their main advantages are the lack the viral genetic material with an "intact" envelope, and the fact that they are significantly more immunogenic than soluble proteins. they can be used as vaccines per se, as well as a delivery system for protein-or nucleic acid based vaccines, or as carriers for small molecules. foreign antigens can be expressed on their surface, or can be simply encapsulated. in addition, amphiphilic adjuvants can be incorporated into their membranes, thereby offering the advantage of combining an adjuvant and the antigen in one entity without a covalent attachment.pseudoviruses are especially attractive for mucosal vaccination protocols, since they offer the opportunity to use the natural route of transmission of the agents. induction of serum antibodies, secretory iga, t helper and ctl responses, and protection against mucosal pathogen challenge has been reported from studies in animals and humans [157] [158] [159] . the virosomes generated using the influenza virus retain membrane fusion properties very similar to the naïve virus. therefore, they are able to deliver material to the cytosol of target cells, offering the possibility to access the mhc class i-restricted pathway of antigen presentation to prime ctl activity [160] [161] [162] . bacterial toxins and their derivatives are among the first molecules that have been used as mucosal adjuvants. they are characterized by the presence of an a moiety with enzymatic activity, and a b moiety that mediates toxin binding to the target cells. cholera toxin and the closely related escherichia coli heat-labile toxin showed potent adjuvant activity when co-administrated with different antigens by the mucosal route [163] [164] [165] . however, their use in humans is hampered by their intrinsic toxicity. thus, mutated derivatives were developed, in which the a subunit was modified to remove the adp-ribosylating activity. the resulting polypeptides retain their adjuvanticity, in the absence of detectable toxicity [166] [167] [168] .however, additional studies have demonstrated that even these derivatives can lead to potential severe side-effects, such as retrograde homing of adjuvant and antigen to neural tissues [169] . this might explain, at least in part, the side-effects observed after intranasal vaccination against influenza with a virosomes-based formulation containing heat-labile toxin (i.e., bell's palsy), which in turn led to its retraction from the market. however, chimeric derivatives lacking the targeting moiety for neural tissues (i.e., b subunit) are now available [170] . they might allow the exploitation of the high potential of these molecules for the development of vaccines against respiratory pathogens. in fact, preclinical studies provided the proof-of-concept for the usefulness of derivatives of bacterial toxins in the generation of acellular vaccines against microorganisms, such as s. pneumonia and h. influenzae [171, 172] .other bacterial components were also explored for their activity as adjuvants. the monophosphoryl lipid a retains much of the immune stimulatory properties of lps, without the inherent toxicity [165] . on the other hand, extracellular matrix binding proteins, such as the fibronectin binding protein i of streptococcus pyogenes, also exhibit adjuvant activity [173] . this offers the possibility of using them as dual antigen/adjuvant moieties in the same formulation. recent reports also demonstrate that vaccine formulations containing adamantylamide dipeptide, a non-toxic compound obtained by linking the l-alanine-d-isoglutamine residue of the muramyl dipeptide to the antiviral drug amantadine, confer protection against non typeable h. influenzae in preclinical models [73] . the innate immune system plays a critical early role in host defence against pathogenic microorganisms through the recognition of pathogenassociated molecular patterns [174] . this is achieved through the stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors (prr) that sense a broad range of exogenous and endogenous danger signals [153, 174] . toll-like receptors (tlr) represent the best-characterized family of prr. natural and synthetic tlr agonists are being used as immune modulators to optimize responses after vaccination. since the identification of the tlr4, many mammalian tlr homologues have been identified (i.e., 10 in humans and 13 in mice) [175] . each tlr member binds specifically to different ligands (tab. 2), alone or in combinations (e.g., heterodimers formed by tlr2 with either tlr1 or tlr6). an example of tlr agonist is bacterial dna, but not vertebrate dna, and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated cpg motifs. they act on tlr9, thereby inducing a strong th1 responses by activation of dendritic cells [176, 177] . cpg motifs have been successfully used as adjuvants in preclinical studies of different candidate vaccines against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia [178] [179] [180] .another important adjuvant with tlr-binding capacities is the mycoplasma-derived macrophage-activating lipopeptide malp-2, which act a the level of the tlr heterodimer 2/6 [181, 182] . malp-2 promotes a global activation of cells from the innate and adaptive immune system [183, 184] , such as macrophages, dc, t-and b-lymphocytes [183, 185] . when coadministered with an antigen by either the parenteral or the mucosal route, malp-2 promotes the elicitation of humoral and cellular responses at systemic and mucosal level [186] . preclinical studies suggested that malp-2 could be exploited in vaccine formulations against the sars-associated coronavirus, m. catarrhalis and influenza virus, among others (unpublished data). dna vaccination offers some advantage over the normal antigen vaccination, such as the fact that it is not necessary to express any antigen. in contrast, it is the biosynthetic machinery present in the cells of the vaccinees that takes care of this work. furthermore, since eukaryotic cells are in charge of protein synthesis, their glycosylation and folding are optimal. however, the large-scale purification of dna might be associated with high costs. this can be solved by the use of attenuated or inactivated bacteria or viruses as delivery systems [187] . this approach can also lead to an enhanced induction of antibodies, which is otherwise poor using conventional naked dna vaccines. we have recently demonstrated that bacterial ghosts can be also exploited as a delivery system for dna vaccines for both in vivo and ex vivo applications [188] . the potential of this approach is demonstrated by the fact that it is possible to optimize performance by a broad range of manipulations, such as (i) choice of optimal promoters, (ii) use of codon optimized genes for expression in mammalian cells, (iii) addition of nuclear localization signals or ubiquitination signals to improve expression and processing, and (iv) co-delivery of dna constructs coding for immune modulatory molecules [189] . in addition, by the presence of immune stimulatory cpg motifs, the dna vaccine constructs has built-in adjuvant properties. this vaccination approach is particularly suited for the stimulation of cellular immune responses [190] . interestingly, several reports suggest that dna vaccines may represent a valid alternative to prime the neonatal immune system, even in the presence of passive transferred maternal antibodies [191, 192] . in fact, promising results were also obtained in preclinical models of community-acquired pneumonia, such as influenza [193] and s. pneumoniae [194] . furthermore, dna coding for vaccine antigens appears to induce excellent immunological memory, which can be reawakened by later immunization or exposure to the pathogen.the knowledge generated in several basic disciplines, such as immunology and microbial pathogenesis, has allowed the identification of critical bottlenecks for establishing a successful vaccination strategy. it is expected that in the coming years we will develop customized approaches to address each of them, in order to stimulate efficient protection against infective agents under specific clinical settings (i.e., newborns, aging individuals, immunocompromised patients).the importance of immunological memory b lymphocytes that have differentiated into plasma cells are the producers of antigen-specific igg antibodies. bone-marrow (bm) plasma cells have a short life, therefore, the bm reservoir needs to be replenished by the stimulation of memory b cells [195, 196] . the maximal life span of bm plasma cells is still debated. only few factors have been identified that control the differentiation of antigen-specific b cells toward short-or long-life plasma cells or to memory b cells [119] . beside the requirement of cd4 + t cells, the nature of the antigen [197] and the dose are also important. higher antigen doses, as well as rapid vaccination schedules (closely spaced vaccine doses) tend to favour the rapid induction of short-term effectors, whereas lower doses of antigens preferentially support the induction of immune memory [198] [199] [200] [201] .it was demonstrated that neonatal vaccination (priming) and infant boosting might be effective even when pathogen exposure occurs very early in life. in children in whom vaccine-induced hib antibody titres have fallen to undetectable levels, memory is readily demonstrated [202] . however, immune memory per se is not enough to protect against pathogens that required high levels of neutralizing antibodies. the delay between memory b-cell reactivation and differentiation may limit the ability to interrupt pathogen invasion. therefore, it is important to establish vaccination protocols in which the population is boosted at different ages in order to maintain the required levels of antibodies. this is particularly important in diseases in which antibodies play a central role in microbial clearance or toxin neutralization. in the particular case of community-acquired pneumonia, we should consider that aging individuals are neglected in many vaccination programs. however, the strategies proposed for elderly would be different from those used for small children, since the main factors affecting vaccine efficacy are immune senescence and immaturity, respectively. the attempts to give a rational solution to this issue are discussed in the next sections.the immune system in children immune responses to bacterial and viral antigens usually increase with age in a stepwise manner [203] . prompt immunization after birth is required to induce active immunity against diseases that may occur early in life. unfortunately, this strategy is limited by the relative immaturity of the neonatal and infant immune system. some factors implicated in this poor response are the limited switch from igm to igg2 antibodies, impaired complement-mediated reactions and deficient organization of the splenic marginal zone. vaccination studies performed in newborn mice suggested that limited germinal centre reactions may results from the delayed devel-opment of follicular dc and limit plasma cell differentiation [204] . it was also showed that the neonatal bm has a limited capacity to support the establishment of long-life antibody-secreting plasma cells [205] .thus, the responses to glyco-conjugates and to most t-cell-dependent antigens are usually affected [119] . therefore, only few and highly immunogenic vaccines show significant protective efficacy after a single dose in infants. the limited igg responses are extended all over the first year of life. in addition, the immune responses, particularly antibodies, elicited in the first year of life after vaccination rapidly decline [203] . however, the problem observed in infants in terms of magnitude and duration of immune response does not seem to affect efficient priming. in fact, the immune memory generated in neonates may be recalled later in life [119] . nevertheless, strategies to generate strong and long-lasting protective responses in infants are still needed. this is in part due to the presence of maternal antibodies, which inactivate and clear the vaccine antigens, thereby rendering difficult the stimulation of an immature immune system [203] . in addition, the effects of adjuvants reported in adults cannot be extrapolated to neonates [206] . a potential strategy to overcome these problems would be to implement vaccination during pregnancy, to provide the required antibodies by placenta and later by maternal feeding [30, [207] [208] [209] . this could be complemented with an early priming of the "immature" immune system of the newborn by dna vaccination, followed by a boost during the second half of the first year or later in life [203] .poly-pathology and multiple organ failure is the rule rather than the exception in aging individuals. thus, many systems are affected (e.g., endocrine, cardiovascular), and the immune system is not an exception. the mechanisms involved in the immune senescence process, which in turn may lead to poor response to vaccination, are not fully understood. however, it is clear that responses against certain vaccines are more affected by immune senescence than others (e.g., ps-based vaccines against s. pneumoniae) [210] . in contrast, the responses to a boost dose of the anti-tetanus vaccine are hardly affected by age [211] .a rapid decline of antibody responses, together with a relative restriction of the t-cell repertoire is characteristic of the immune senescence process. this restriction and the reduction in the pool of naïve cells can explain the poor cd4 + t cell responses against antigens that are cross-reacting with proteins which were seen earlier in life. in contrast, t-cells responses of healthy elderly individuals to new antigens are often unaffected. nevertheless, the overall response to vaccination in the elderly is less efficient than in young adults, making more vigorous approaches necessary (fig. 2) .in the case of influenza, the actual strategy is annual re-vaccination. however, there are concerns regarding the capacity to increase antibodies with proper specificity against re-assorted viruses in aging adults who have been repeatedly infected or immunized. after exposure to a new, but cross-reacting antigenic variant, such individuals may respond by producing antibodies. however, these antibodies could be primarily directed against influenza strains, which were encountered earlier in life. figure 2 . factors affecting the responses in young adults and aging individuals after vaccination. the process of immune senescence impairs host response to both infection and vaccination. this critical issue needs to be considered during vaccine design and will require the development of special approaches.for example, individuals previously exposed to the "old" h1n1 influenza strain (i.e., 50 years ago), may respond differently from naïve adults who are vaccinated with a "new" h1n1 strain which have accumulated different mutations. the former might produce antibodies against the ha of the "old" h1n1 strain rather than to the cross-reacting epitopes of the new strain [212] . this is phenomenon is the so-called "original antigenic sin" [119] . on the basis of this observations, it was proposed that variations in vaccine efficacy might be due to differences in the antigenic distance between the vaccine strains and the epidemic strains responsible for influenza outbreaks [213] . however, this hypothesis was not confirmed by epidemiologic studies [214] . even more, individuals aged 65 years or older who were annually vaccinated showed a significantly reduced mortality risk. therefore, until now, it seems that the antigenic sin does not represent a major practical obstacle in influenza vaccination and additional strategies may not be required.despite the broad availability of vaccines against agents causing community-acquired pneumonia, they still represent an important cause of death, human suffering and economic losses. however, we have dramatically expanded our knowledge on the pathophysiology of diseases caused by respiratory pathogens, their virulence factors and the effector mechanisms responsible for their clearance. it is becoming clearer which microbial components are attractive as vaccine targets, as well as the type of immune response needed to confer protection against disease. thus, it is now possible to address vaccine development using rational rather than empiric approaches. this is facilitated by powerful bioinformatics tools for the accurate prediction of epitopes and proteasome trimming [215] [216] [217] , as well as by the availability of a broad palette of immune modulators and delivery systems. therefore, we can predict that new and improved vaccines against the etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonia will considerably reduce the global impact of this disease in the coming years. a new disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) originated in china in late 2002 and spread rapidly to many countries. upon this outbreak, a global collaboration network was coordinated by who. as a result of this unprecedented international effort, a novel type of coronavirus (sars-cov) was identified as the etiologic agent of sars (1, 2) in march 2003. the genomic sequence of sars-cov was completed and we now know that sars-cov has all the features and characteristics of other coronaviruses, but it is quite different from all previously known coronaviruses (groups i~iii), representing a new group (group iv) (3, 4) . it is assumed that sars-cov is a mutant coronavirus transmitted from a wild animal that developed the ability to productively infect humans (3, 5) . the genome of sars-cov is a single-stranded plus-sense rna~30 kb in length and containing five major open reading frames that encode nonstructural replicase polyproteins and structural proteins: the spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m) and nucleocapsid protein (n), in the same order and of approximately the same sizes as those of other coronaviruses (5) .the reason why sars-cov induces severe respiratory distress in some, but not all, infected individuals is still unclear. in patients with sars and probable sars cases, virus is detected in sputum, stool and plasma by rt-pcr (1, 2) . these patients developed serum antibodies against sars-cov and high antibody titers against n protein were maintained for more than 5 months after infection (6) . because of their generally poor pathogenicity and difficulty of propagation in vitro, there have been few studies regarding immunity to human coronaviruses oc43 and 229e. in the veterinary field, however, coronaviruses have been known for many years to cause a variety of lung, liver and gut diseases in animals. as we learned from these animal models, both humoral and cellular immune responses may contribute to protection against coronavirus diseases, including sars [for review see (7) ].the clinical manifestation of sars is hardly distinct from other common respiratory viral infections including influenza. because an influenza epidemic may occur simultaneously with the re-emergence of sars, it is urgently required that we develop effective sars vaccines as well as sensitive diagnostic tests specific for sars. recently, the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ace2) was identified as a cellular receptor for sars-cov (8) . the first step in viral infection is presumably the binding of s protein to its receptor, ace2. in the murine mhv model, s proteins are known to contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibodies in mice (9, 10) . therefore, the s protein would be the first candidate coronavirus protein for induction of immunity. however, the s, m and n proteins are also known to contribute to generating the host immune response (11, 12) .following an established vaccine protocol is one of the best ways to shorten the time and cost of new vaccine development. most of the currently available vaccines for humans are inactivated and applied cutaneously, except oral polio vaccine, and adjuvant usage is mostly limited to aluminum hydroxide gel (alum). in order to know the immunogenicity of inactivated sars-cov as a vaccine candidate, we immunized mice with uv-inactivated sars-cov either with or without alum. we report here the evaluation of humoral and cellular immunity elicited by uv-inactivated sars-cov administered subcutaneously.sars-cov (hku39849) was kindly supplied by dr j.s.m. peiris, department of microbiology, the university of hong kong. the virus was amplified in vero e6 cells and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. concentrated virus was then exposed to uv light (4.75 j/cm 2 ) in order to inactivate the virus. we confirmed that the virus completely lost its infectivity by this method.female balb/c mice were purchased from nippon slc inc. (shizuoka, japan) and were housed under specific pathogenfree conditions. all experimental procedures were carried out under niid-recommended guidelines. mice were subcutaneously injected via their back or right and left hind leg footpads with 10 lg of uv-inactivated purified sars-cov with or without 2 mg of alum, and boosted by the same procedure 7 weeks after priming.blood was obtained from the tail vein and allowed to clot overnight at 4°c. sera were then collected by centrifugation.for elisa, microtiter plates (dynatech, chantily, va) were coated overnight at 4°c with sars-cov-infected or mockinfected vero e6 cell lysates, which had been treated with 1% np40 followed by uv-inactivation. to detect s or n protein, the plates were coated with 1% np40 lysates of chick embryo fibroblasts that had been infected with s or n proteinexpressing dis (attenuated vaccinia virus) (13) . the plates were blocked with 1% ova in pbs-tween (0.05%) and then incubated with the sera serially diluted at 1:25-1:10 5 for 1 h at room temperature. plates were incubated with either peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse igg (1:2000, zymed, san francisco, ca), igm or iga (1:2000, southern biotechnology, birmingham, al) antibody. for detection of igg subclasses, either peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse igg 1 , igg 2a , igg 2b (1:2000, zymed) or igg 3 (1:2000, southern biotechnology) was used. plates were washed three times with pbs-tween at each step. antibodies were detected by o-phenylenediamine (zymed), and the absorbance of each well was read at 490 nm using a model 680 microplate reader (bio-rad, hercules, ca). as a standard for igg detection, serum was obtained from a hyper-immunized mouse; the od490nm value of 100 u/ml standard was~3 in all assays. sars-cov-specific igg titer was calculated as follows: sars-specific igg titer (u/ml) = (the unit value obtained at wells coated with virus-infected cell lysates) -(the unit value obtained at wells coated with noninfected cell lysates).recombinant n protein (amino acids 1-49 and 340-390) of sars-cov (biodesign, saco, me) was diluted to 10 lg/ml in pbs, and then added at 100 ll per well to plates supported by a nitrocellulose filter (millipore, bedford, ma). after overnight incubation at 4°c, the plates were washed with pbs three times and then blocked at 4°c overnight with 1% ova in pbs-tween (0.05%). after erythrocyte lysis, single cell suspensions from bms were suspended in rpmi supplemented with 10% fcs, 5 3 10 ÿ5 m 2me, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 lg/ml streptomycin, and then applied to the plates at a concentration of 3 3 10 5 cells per well. after 24 h cultivation, the plates were recovered and stained with alkaline phosphataseconjugated anti-mouse igg 1 antibody (southern biotechnologies). alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized using 3-amino-ethyl carbozole and napthol as-mx phosphate/fast blue bb (sigma). the frequency of plasma cells specific for n protein was determined from the n protein-coated plates after background on the uncoated plates was subtracted.serum was inactivated by incubation at 56°c for 30 min. the known tissue culture infectious dose (tcid) of sars-cov was incubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of serum antibodies serially diluted 5-fold, and then added to vero e6 cell culture grown confluently in a 96-well microtiter plate. after 48 h, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet to visualize the cytopathic effect induced by the virus (14) . neutralization antibody titers were expressed as the minimum dilution number of serum that inhibited the cytopathic effect.purified sars-cov virion (0.5 lg) was fractionated on sds-page under reduced conditions. proteins were transferred to pvdf membrane (genetics, tokyo, japan) and reacted with the diluted sera (1:1000) that had been obtained from mice inoculated with uv-irradiated sars-cov. after washing, the membrane was reacted with hrp-conjugated f(ab9) 2 fragment anti-mouse igg (h+l) (1:20 000 jackson immuno research, west grove, pa), followed by visualization of the bands on x-ray film (kodak, rochester, ny) using chemiluminescent regents (amasham biosciences, piscataway, nj).popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes and spleens were harvested from mice 1 week after the boost vaccination. after the preparation of a single cell suspension, t cells were purified by depletion of b220 + , gr1 + , cd11b + , igd + and igm + cells using a magnetic cell sort system (macs: miltenyi biotec, bergisch gladbach, germany). to prepare antigenpresenting cells (apc), normal balb/c mouse splenocytes were depleted of cd3 + t cells by macs and irradiated at 2000 cgy.purified t cells taken from lymph nodes (1 3 10 5 cells/well) were cultured with irradiated apc (5 3 10 5 cells/well) in the presence or absence of uv-irradiated purified sars-cov virion (1 or 10 lg/ml). four days after the cultivation, the level of cytokine concentration in the culture supernatant was measured by flow cytometry using a mouse th1/th2 cytokine cytometric bead array kit (becton dickinson, san jose, ca). t-cell proliferation was monitored by the incorporation of [ 3 h]thymidine (18.5 kbq/well, icn biomedicals, costa mesa, ca) added 8 h prior to cell harvest. the cells were harvested on a 96-well microplate bonded with a gf/b filter (packard instruments, meriden, ct). incorporated radioactivity was counted by a microplate scintillation counter (packard instruments).inoculation with uv-inactivated sars-cov results in an antigen-specific igg 1 response, probably by generating long-term ascs as well as memory cellsto examine the level of anti-sars-cov response in mice after inoculation with vaccine candidates, three mice in each group were subcutaneously inoculated with 10 lg of uv-inactivated purified sars-cov with (virion/alum) or without alum (virion), or inoculated with alum alone (alum) or left untreated (none) as a control (fig. 1) . one month after inoculation, vaccinated mice elicited the anti-sars cov igg antibody in sera at high levels. as expected, the alum adjuvant enhanced the level of igg antibody response, >10-fold higher than the level without adjuvant ( fig. 1c compared with b) . when mice were boosted at 7 weeks, the level of igg antibody in both groups of mice was further increased~10-fold above the primary response ( fig. 1b and c) . notably, the level of serum antibodies induced by a single injection of virion, even in the absence of the alum adjuvant, was maintained at least more than 6 months (fig. 1d) . these results suggest that long-term ascs can be established by a single shot of uv-inactivated virion administration.upon restimulation with antigen, memory b cells rapidly differentiate into ascs and migrate into the bone marrow to establish a long-term asc pool (15, 16) . to enumerate the number of plasma cells specific for sars-cov, we performed an elispot assay using recombinant n proteins, amino acid numbers 1-49 (n1-49) and 340-390 (n340-390) as coating antigens. consistent with the serum anti-sars cov igg level, sars-specific igg 1 plasma cells were maintained in the bone marrow at day 10 after boost immunization with virion/alum (fig. 2) . in contrast, the number of spots from control mice was below the detection limit (i.e. <1 asc/9 3 10 5 cells).we determined the subclass of serum anti-sars-cov igg antibodies in the boosted mice using anti-mouse igg 1 , igg 2a , igg 2b or igg 3 second antibody by elisa (fig. 3) . interestingly, the level of anti-sars-cov igg 2a in mice immunized with virion/alum was comparable to that in mice immunized with virion alone, whereas the level of anti-sars-cov igg 1 was higher in mice with virion/alum than the mice with virion alone. in contrast, the levels of igg 2b and igg 3 antibodies were fairly low in both groups. therefore, our results indicated that vaccination with a combination of inactivated virion and alum induced a predominantly th2-type immune response.we also measured serum immunoglobulins other than igg in the early and late phases of immunization. to avoid high igg concentrations interfering with the detection of igm and iga antibodies, the serum igg was absorbed with protein gconjugated beads (>98%). the levels of anti-sars-cov igm antibodies in the igg-depleted sera, which were obtained 4 weeks after priming, were below our detection limit. likewise, anti-sars-cov iga antibody in the igg-depleted sera, which were obtained 1 week after booster, was not detectable (data not shown).whether or not immune sera possess a neutralizing activity against sars-cov is a crucial aspect of vaccination. we estimated the neutralizing activity of sera obtained 1 week after boost inoculation (table 1) . we observed that neutralizing activity against sars-cov was detected at a high level in sera of mice inoculated with virion/alum or virion alone. taken together, these results indicate that subcutaneous vaccination with uv-inactivated sars-cov virion is able to elicit a sufficient amount of igg antibodies with neutralizing activity.using the immune sera of mice boosted with virion/alum 1 week before, we analyzed the specificity of serum igg by western blot analysis (see methods). as shown in fig. 4(a) , the robust signal detected at 50 kda corresponds to the n protein of sars-cov, as predicted by its genome size (3, 4) . a band near 200 kda appears to correspond to s protein, analogous with the s protein of other human coronaviruses, hcv-229e and hcv-oc43, which are known to be heavily glycosylated and detected at 186 kda and 190 kda, respectively (17) . our result is consistent with the data reported recently by xiao et al. who expressed the full-length s glycoprotein of sars-cov tor2 strain in 293 cells and showed that the protein rañ 180-200 kda in sds gels (18) . the origins of the 120 kda and the faint 37 kda bands were unknown. however, similar bands were also detected on a fluorogram by using anti-n mabs (ohnishi, k., sakaguchi, m., takasuka, n. et al., unpublished data), suggesting that it is related to n protein. the specificity of igg in the immune sera was also determined by elisa plates coated with lysates of cells infected with either s-or n-expressing recombinant vaccinia viruses (fig. 4b) . the results indicated that anti-s as well as anti-n protein igg antibodies were elicited by virion/alum vaccination.to examine whether or not subcutaneously vaccinated mice gained an induced t-cell response against sars-cov, mice were immunized either with virion/alum, virion, or alum only via the footpad. t cells of these mice were enriched from the spleen and regional lymph nodes 1 week after a booster immunization and cultured with irradiated apcs in the presence or absence of uv-inactivated sars-cov virion at 1 or 10 lg/ml. as shown in fig. 5 (a), regional lymph node t cells proliferated in vitro in response to uv-inactivated virion in virion/alum-immunized mice and, to a lesser extent, in virionimmunized mice. because mice inoculated with virion/alum showed a high basal level of proliferation of lymph node t cells in the absence of antigen, there is not much difference in the net proliferative response of these cells between the virion/ alum group and the virion only group. on the other hand, in splenic t cells, a low level of proliferation was observed only in the virion/alum group of mice. the level of proliferation of these t cells, however, was virion-dose independent. therefore, our results suggest that the subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion, even without alum, does induce t cell activation to some extent in the draining lymph node, a result which hardly occurs systemically.we also measured the level of cytokine production in the supernatant of lymph node t cells stimulated with inactivated virion in vitro for 4 days. we found that the inactivated virion induced the production of all the cytokines (il-2, il-4, il-5, ifn-c and tnf-a) in t cells of virion/alum-immunized mice, in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 5b) . likewise, t cells of virionimmunized mice produced low, yet significant, levels of these cytokines in a dose-dependent manner, except il-5. in contrast, lymph node t cells from normal mice did not produce any cytokines at all in response to virion, suggesting that the virion itself does not possess innate stimulating activity as bacterial products [such as lipopolysaccharide (lps) and purified protein derivative of mycobacterium tuberculosis (ppd)] do. taken together, these results suggest that subcutaneous vaccination with uv-inactivated sars-cov is able to activate cd4 + t cells in regional lymph nodes, where t cells produce several immunoregulatory cytokines, including ifn-c.the present results demonstrated that even a single subcutaneous administration of uv-irradiated virion without alum adjuvant induced a high level of systemic anti-sars-cov antibody response in mice, probably followed by the generation of long-term antibody-secreting cells and memory cells in the bone marrow. considering that polyvalent particulate *all six mice examined did not have detectable neutralizing activity. sera were obtained from mice 1 week after boost vaccination and subjected to sars-cov neutralizing activity assay as described in methods. the titer is a reciprocal number of minimum serum dilution that inhibits the cytopathic effect. structures such as hepatitis b virus surface antigen-based, hiv-1 gag-based and ty virus-like particles have been shown to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune responses (19) , these particulates probably have comparable dimensions and structures to the pathogens that are targeted for uptake by apcs to facilitate the induction of potent immune responses. the antibodies elicited in mice vaccinated by the current protocol with or without adjuvant recognized both the s and n proteins of sars-cov and were able to neutralize the infection of virus to vero e6 cells. however, serum anti-sars-cov iga antibody was not detectable, probably owing to the route of vaccination. in addition, the present vaccination protocol caused t cell response at the regional lymph nodes, although it did not allow for the induction of a sufficient cellular immune response systemically. we show here the potentiality of subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion with alum, which is utilized for most of current human vaccinations. alum has been used as an adjuvant for vaccines such as diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, and these vaccines have a long safety record for human use (20) . we observed that the addition of alum to the vaccine formula resulted in a large augmentation of serum igg 1 production, but not igg 2a production. the level of igg 1 in alum-vaccinated mice reached a level similar to that found in hyper-immunized mice, which were subcutaneously injected with 5 lg of inactivated virion emulsified with a complete freund adjuvant, followed by consecutive three-times intravenous boosters with 2 lg of virion. alum is known to selectively stimulate an igg 1 dominant, type 2 immune response [reviewed in (21) ]. activation of complement by alum could contribute to the type 2-biased immune response partly via an inhibition of il-12 production. interestingly, a quite recent report demonstrated that an alum-induced gr1 + myeloid cell population produced il-4 and activated b-cells (22) .there are various diseases associated with animal coronavirus infection. the clinical manifestations of the disease and the correlates of protection with immunity have been studied extensively in these animal coronavirus infections [reviewed in (7) ]. although antibodies and t cells may play a role in exacerbating the pathology in some animal coronavirus infections (23, 24) , both humoral and cellular immune responses are known to contribute to protection against coronavirus infection. in murine hepatitis virus, a group 2 coronavirus, the mortality of susceptible mice was partially prevented by the transfer of immune serum containing neutralizing antibody prior to challenge (25) . recently, zhi-yong et al. reported in the murine acute infection model that the neutralizing antibody elicited by vaccination of dna encoding s was protective, but cellular components of vaccinated mice were not required for the inhibition of viral replication (26) . because a twice parenteral administration of inactivated virion with alum induced a high level of antibodies that are able to neutralize sars-cov, this vaccination protocol may have a certain effect on the protection of humans from sars-cov infection.we observed that two successive inoculations with inactivated virus at 7 week intervals generated sars-cov-specific t cells. these cells were restimulated with the irradiated virus in vitro, but their response was low in terms of the level of proliferation and production of inf-c and il-2. however, irrespective of vaccination protocols with or without alum adjuvant, virus-primed t cells of vaccinated animals were capable of producing il-4 at high levels upon in vitro stimulation, comparable to other reports for a variety of vaccination studies (27, 28) . this outlook seems compatible with the idea that the present vaccine protocol may tend to select t-cell subsets with th2 phenotype. however, it remains to be elucidated whether such t cells may exhibit serological memory phenotype and persist in the immune system after vaccination as long as memory b cells, which may persist more than 180 days post vaccination. in addition, further analysis is needed to clarify whether tcell response is a crucial factor for long-term protection against sars-cov infections.efforts to develop a sars-cov vaccine have been carried out by many profitable or non-profitable organizations in various ways. for example, it has recently been reported that the combination of adenovirus vector expressing sars-s, -m or -n protein elicited a neutralizing capacity in serum and nspecific t-cell response in rhesus macaques (29) . however, it is still uncertain whether or not the immunity against only these components of sars-cov is sufficient for virus protection. sars-cov tends to cause replication errors, which may allow the virus to escape the host-immune response and result in a seasonal outbreak. from this point of view, it resembles influenza virus. in influenza virus, inactivated ha vaccine showed incomplete protection but had a certain efficacy and safety record for a long period of time. indeed, this approach has been used in the veterinary field, such as with the bovine coronavirus (30) and canine coronavirus (31) . these advantages make a whole killed virion a prime candidate for a sars vaccine, even if it may not have the best protective ability.unfortunately, no information is available so far on the immune correlates of protection against human coronaviruses, including sars-cov. in consideration that sars-cov transmission occurs by direct contact with droplets or by the fecal oral route, mucosal secretary iga in both the lower respiratory tract and digestive tract seem to be crucially important. failure to induce iga-type antibodies in a current systemic vaccination method should be improved. notably, iga antibodies were detectable in the sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from mice hyper-immunized with uv-irradiated virus (data not shown). therefore, if a non-toxic and more potent adjuvant becomes available for human use, the subcutaneous injection of inactivated virion would become an effective vaccination method to reduce the number of susceptible people.in the future, it will be necessary to determine whether or not the inactivated whole virion vaccine possesses protective ability against sars-cov infection by the use of adequate animal models. furthermore, whether the alum addition augmented the protection and the effective period of sars-cov virion vaccination should be addressed, because currently used inactivated influenza virus whole virion vaccine is significantly effective without any adjuvant. meanwhile, we also need to develop a potent adjuvant for induction of a much stronger mucosal immunity, in addition to evaluating available methods of virion inactivation.vaccines remain one of the greatest accomplishments of human ingenuity, scientific endeavor, and the combined global efforts of the public health community. the rates of incidence and mortality associated with infection by rna viruses such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella have declined by greater than 95% compared to pre-vaccination rates [1] . though highly successful in the past, conventional approaches to rna virus vaccine development, such as live-attenuation through passaging (forward genetics) or inactivation, may be less efficient for generating good candidates than rational targeted mutagenesis (reverse genetics). advancements in recombinant dna technology and virus reverse genetics have provided key critical insights into the replication and pathogenesis of rna viruses and facilitate vaccine development through targeted modifications and directed attenuation. the advent of reverse genetics and molecular engineering of viruses has transformed the field of open access virology by permitting study of targeted genetic changes in virus genomes. in 1981, the first infectious rna virus clone was isolated from cdna to generate poliovirus [2] . since then, reverse genetics technology and recombinant virus design has been employed to generate reverse genetic clones representing all major virus families. in addition, these techniques and approaches have now become the focus of new efforts to design vaccines that incorporate specific changes in either component-based or virus-based systems to induce lasting immunity in the host without health risks or deleterious effects.since the development of effective live-attenuated vaccines, new vaccine preparations utilizing well-established vectors, expression of specific viral proteins or components (subunit vaccines), and development of virus-like particles (vlps), have continued to shape the domain of vaccine discovery and development. the challenge of establishing a safe, immunogenic platform, which induces lasting immunity in the context of a wide variety of viral systems, has resulted in remarkable creativity and variability in the approaches employed. use of replicating viruses in vaccines, such as live-attenuated or chimeric vector-based platforms, have the benefits of high immunogenicity, lower costs, and ease to transport and administer. yet, these viruses have the potential to revert to more pathogenic phenotypes and may be under-attenuated in immunocompromised hosts. conversely, component, subunit, or killed pathogen vaccines have the benefits of generally being safer and can be used to display the most immunogenic antigens. however, the costs, time of development, and weaker induced immune responses present their own challenges to design and implementation. in this review, we describe rna virus reverse genetics systems and provide an overview of current efforts to use reverse genetics technology in the development of safe and effective vaccines.current rna virus reverse genetics systems make use of multiple common features of rna virus biology. first, rna viruses generate genomic copies through the activity of a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp). in addition, nearly all rna virus replication strategies are independent from the host cell nucleus and instead reside in the cytoplasm. for positive-strand rna viruses, such as poliovirus, immediately after entry and uncoating, the genomic rna is directly translated by host ribosomes to generate viral protein products. since the virus rarely needs to package additional non-structural proteins in the virion, most positive-sense rna virus reverse genetics systems largely focus on delivery of either transcribed genomic rna into the cell cytoplasm or delivery of cdna under the control of a viral transcription promoter such as t7 or cmv (figure 1 ) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . however, negative-strand and double-strand rna virus reverse genetic systems often require the use of additional helper constructs to introduce the rdrp and other essential proteins to initiate genomic replication. a recent alternative approach, which has been employed in the field of influenza research, is to synthesize viral rna and drive mrna production through the activity of the host polymerases such as pol i and pol ii [11, 12] . this approach has simplified the logistics of plasmid transfection and increased the efficacy of recombinant virus recovery. a similar approach has been successfully employed for recovery of an arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomenigitis virus (lcmv) [13] . one additional platform that has been employed for rna virus infectious clone generation is the bacterial artificial chromosome (bac). bac constructs are single-copy dna plasmids based on the f-plasmid of bacteria, which are genetically stable in e. coli and permit the insertion of large dna fragments to be transcribed under the control of a transcriptional promoter such as t7. bac constructs have been employed for many years in the recovery of large dna viruses. however, the genetic stability of these constructs has led to their use in recombinant rna virus platforms. several positive-strand rna viruses and one negative-strand rna virus have used bacs as a platform for reverse genetic design (table 1) . since most rna virus replication strategies are segregated from the host genome and replication machinery, few rna viruses modify host gene expression and cause oncogenesis. as a result, rna reverse genetic systems do not typically have to account for the potential transformation of host cells. lastly, most rna viruses are limited to small genome sizes with the majority smaller than 15 kb due to reduced genomic stability and the lowered fidelity of the viral rdrp. subsequently, reverse genetic approaches often employ the use of cdna genetic clones for greater versatility in manipulation and modification of the virus genome. with an rdrp (such as t7 polymerase). negative-strand rna virus reverse genetic platforms often involve transfection or electroporation of genomic or more commonly subgenomic cdna into permissive cells in combination with either a helper virus or helper plasmids, all of which driven by a rdrp. some negative-strand rna systems employ host polymerase i (pol i) and ii (pol ii) promoters to drive viral rna synthesis and mrna production. in both positive-and negative-strand reverse genetics systems, the rdrp (*) is typically constitutively or transiently expressed in the permissive cell type. positive-strand rna viruses have genomes which are infectious upon entry into host cells. upon entry, host ribosomes translate the viral rna into one or more polyproteins, which require either host or viral proteases for processing. although many different reverse genetics platforms have been used to generate positive-strand rna virus clones, nearly all share the common goal to introduce either sense genomic rna transcripts directly or cdna to be transcribed by an included rdrp (figure 1 ). below we describe approaches that have been employed to generate infectious clones of picornaviruses, coronaviruses, and flaviviruses and how these strategies have been and are currently being applied to develop vaccines.picornaviruses are a family of non-enveloped, positive-strand rna viruses, which collectively infect a wide range of human and animal hosts. human picornaviral pathogens cause illnesses, which vary from the common cold to poliomyelitis. the picornavirus virion consists of an icosahedral capsid structure surrounding an rna genome ranging from approximately 7 to 9 kb in size. poliovirus and rhinovirus remain two of the most extensively studied picornaviruses to date and have become model systems for the study of rna virus biology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology. during the 1950's, extensive efforts began to develop and implement a polio vaccine in the hopes to eradicate the virus since no non-human primate reservoirs are known to exist in nature. the effectiveness of the inactivated (salk) vaccine and live-attenuated (sabin) vaccines led to increased efforts to develop and design vaccines for many other human pathogens. international vaccination efforts are aimed at eradicating the disease. the success and employed strategies for implementation of vaccines for poliovirus opened the door to evaluating new approaches and efforts to study and understand rna virus biology. a major step occurred in 1981 when racaniello and baltimore introduced a full-length cdna clone of poliovirus into a cell and recovered infectious virus [2] . although initially the mechanism by which a cdna clone in a plasmid could give rise to productive rna virus infection was unknown, the cdna platform approach used by racaniello [30, 31] . advances in the understanding and engineering of plasmids for gene delivery led to more efficient cdna-based systems, which represent the primary reverse genetics approaches used for recovery of picornaviruses today.no commercially available rhinovirus vaccines exist today despite effective reverse genetics platforms for several serotypes. rhinoviruses remain the primary cause of the common cold worldwide and have been extensively studied for over 50 years. yet, the great puzzle of developing a broadly protective rhinovirus vaccine involves solving the overwhelming task of developing an immunogenic platform which can provide protective immunity to the greater than 100 serotypes of rhinovirus that currently circulate in nature [32, 33] . the capsid of rhinovirus is comprised of four distinct serotype-specific proteins (vp1, vp2, vp3, and vp4), which are known to be immunogenic and potentially elicit cross-reactive antibodies [32, [34] [35] [36] . yet, development of broadly-neutralizing rhinovirus protection will likely require the formulation of a polyvalent vaccine which includes incorporation of several serotype variants of the immunogenic capsid proteins [36] . efforts at designing polyvalent rhinovirus vaccine formulations have yet to provide the broad immunogenic memory necessary to be effective. however, regions of vp0 (precursor of vp2 and vp4) have been shown to be conserved across a and b group rhinoviruses, and combination with a t h 1 promoting adjuvant induced a cross-serotype immune response in mice [34] . the discovery of conserved epitopes and recent development of chimeric or new reverse genetics platforms including a mouse model of infection may provide a novel avenue to the efficient display of epitopes from the breadth of rhinovirus diversity [37] [38] [39] .coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand rna viruses which encode the largest known rna virus genomes varying in size from 26 to 32 kb [40] . coronavirus infections in humans are associated with upper and lower respiratory illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). over the last 12 years, four new human coronaviruses have been identified including sars coronavirus and the recent middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronavirus [41] . despite a high clinical and economic burden and potential for emerging infectious disease, no commercially available vaccines currently exist.there are currently two common platforms that are used for generating full-length infectious coronavirus clones. the first platform involves in vitro transcription and capping of a full-length cdna clone of the coronavirus genome followed by introduction into competent cells by either transfection or electroporation. the coronavirus genome, which is approximately 30 kb in size, is often maintained as fragments in low-copy plasmids. during virus assembly, the fragments are restriction digested and ligated together prior to transcription. this approach has been successfully used to recover clones of many coronaviruses including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) [8] , murine hepatitis virus (mhv) [10] , nl63 [42] , sars coronavirus [9] , sars-like bat coronaviruses [43] , and mers coronavirus [5] . another common platform utilizes existing bac technology. the coronavirus genome is introduced into a bac construct under the control of a cmv promoter. this approach has been successfully used to recover clones of human viruses oc43 and mers coronavirus [3, 16] . both of these approaches yield productive infections and high titers of progeny virus. a third approach involving a vaccinia vector platform has also been used successfully for the production of human 229e infectious clones [7] .efforts to design a coronavirus vaccine have focused on a variety of approaches including development of inactivated virus, live-attenuated virus, and a variety of subunit vaccines. one major focus of current coronavirus vaccine efforts is focusing on ways to create a live-attenuated vaccine strain, which combines existing treatments with a less virulent and more stable virus platform. during the sars epidemic, patients showed little improvement when treated with ribavirin. recent studies have shown that coronaviruses are resistant to ribavirin treatment due to the presence of a viral exonuclease (nsp14) with proofreading activity [44, 45] . additionally, deletion of the exonuclease proofreading activity results in a hypermutation phenotype that appears genetically stable and induces protection in murine models [46] [47] [48] . the recent outbreak of mers-cov has triggered a demand for the development of a mers vaccine [49] . several approaches are being explored including identifying effective neutralizing antibodies, use of the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein as a component to induce immunity, and direct changes to recombinant mers-cov [3, [50] [51] [52] . the availability of effective reverse genetics platforms for coronaviruses associated with high mortality viruses such as sars and mers coronaviruses, and the potential for low cost for development and implementation provide promise for creating an effective vaccine platform.flaviviruses are small, enveloped, positive-strand rna viruses that infect a wide range of hosts. flavivirus genomes are markedly smaller than coronaviruses at approximately 10-12 kb in size, and the transmission of most flaviviruses is dependent upon an arthropod vector (hence their common name, arboviruses). flavivirus diseases range from asymptomatic to severe neurological disease such as encephalitis, meningitis, and myelitis [53] . yellow fever virus (yfv), a deadly flavivirus associated with over 30,000 deaths annually (who), was identified in 1901 by walter reed and was the first human viral pathogen ever discovered [54] [55] [56] . outbreaks and disease connected to flaviviruses have stressed the importance of developing reverse genetic platforms and efficacious vaccines.similar to picornaviruses, nearly all flavivirus reverse genetics platforms involve either in vitro transcription of full-length or ligated cdna fragments of the genome or use a bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) platform (table 1) and are subsequently transfected or electroporated into competent cells. reverse genetics platforms have been developed for a wide range of flaviviruses including yfv [57, 58] , dengue types 1-4 [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] , jev [67] , kunjin virus [68] , tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) [69] [70] [71] , murray valley encephalitis virus [72] , langat virus [73] , west nile virus (wnv) [6, 74] , and omsk hemorrhagic fever virus [75] . advances in the recombinant flavivirus approaches have been instrumental in new vaccine design efforts.some of the first vaccine efforts were directed at generating inactivated or live-attenuated strains for vaccinations against flaviviruses. in 1937, max theiler developed a safe yfv live-attenuated vaccine called 17d through the use of a serial passaged virus originally isolated from an african patient [76] . the vaccine composition used today remains largely the same as that first developed over 70 years ago and provides protective immunity for over 30 years [77] [78] [79] . jev was first isolated and studied in the 1930's and an inactivated vaccine derived from a mouse brain was first developed in japan in 1954 [53, 80] . the current formulations of the jev vaccines include inactivated beijing-1 strain or live-attenuated strains, which elicit greater immunogenicity and broader protection than the original nakayama strain [53] . despite the success of vaccine development for yfv and jev, unique challenges have been presented in developing vaccines to some well-known flaviviruses (such as dengue virus) and new emerging flaviviruses (such as wnv).dengue virus is endemic to tropical and subtropical locations worldwide. to date, five distinct serotypes of dengue virus are known, including a new serotype identified in 2013 [53, 81] . infection with one serotype increases the severity of disease upon a secondary infection with a different serotype [82] . consequently, any dengue virus vaccine must either provide protection to all extent serotypes to prevent priming for increased disease by a heterotypic infection or remove the immunogenic components of the virus that cause increased disease severity upon heterotypic infections. efforts to develop stable chimeric platforms for the development of dengue virus vaccines have recently been focused on expressing dengue virus surface proteins in chimeric viruses with other more stable flaviviruses such as yfv [83] [84] [85] . one vaccine candidate is a tetravalent vaccine from sanofi pasteur, which involves the formation of a chimeric yfv strain 17d virus containing the prm/e genes of each dengue serotype [85] . this approach has also recently been adapted to develop similar vaccine candidates to the recently identified wnv [85, 86] . despite several commercially available wnv vaccines for veterinary purposes, there remains no approved wnv vaccine for humans. the future licensure of dengue and wnv vaccines will likely continue to focus on development of live-attenuated or inactivated virus models of vaccination due to the high immunogenicity of flavivirus infections.negative-strand rna virus genomes and antigenomes cannot act as an mrna. to be a substrate of rdrp, they must be encapsidated with nucleocapsid and form ribonucleoprotein complexes (rnps). the antigenomes of negative-strand rna viruses are introduced either as a linearized cdna or as a plasmid under a t7 promoter and are normally co-transfected with one or more plasmids encoding the nucleocapsid and replicase machinery. due to these biological requirements to initiate infection, development of negative-strand rna virus reverse genetics systems has been slower than positive-strand virus systems. initial recovery efforts to generate infectious clones involved recovery of viruses using helper viruses, which could supply the viral genes and proteins necessary for replication. however, these approaches made it difficult to isolate the mutants of interest. the first recovery of a negative-strand rna virus completely from cdna was achieved in 1994 for rabies virus [87, 88] . despite the biological limitations and challenges to working with negative-strand rna viruses, several effective negative-strand rna virus vaccines have been successfully introduced and many more are currently in varying phases of clinical trials. below we describe approaches that have been employed to generate infectious clones and vaccines in paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses.paramyxoviruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-strand rna viruses which are responsible for a variety of human and animal diseases. human paramyxoviruses have been identified which are responsible for diseases including measles, mumps, pneumonia, and the common cold. paramyxoviruses carry a single copy of their genome, which is typically 15 to 19 kb in length. like other negative-strand rna viruses, paramyxoviruses must incorporate their replication machinery, including the rdrp, into the virion during assembly. paramyxovirus reverse genetic systems employ very similar mechanisms. first, the full-length genome or antigenome and helper plasmids expressing nucleocapsid and polymerase proteins are cloned as cdna and are under transcriptional control by a promoter such as t7 rna polymerase. the plasmids are co-transfected into permissive cell lines. earlier reverse genetics systems utilized a co-infection approach with a vaccinia virus expressing t7, however most modern reverse genetics systems use a t7 cell line or transfect a t7 plasmid. recently, the first bac-based reverse genetics system for a negative-strand rna virus was developed for respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) [21] . reverse genetics systems for many paramyxoviruses have been generated including measles virus [89] , mumps virus [90] , hendra virus [91] , nipah virus [92] , rsv [21, 93] . despite the availability of reverse genetics systems, development of paramyxovirus vaccines has been met with variable success.the first paramyxovirus vaccine was developed during the 1950's. john enders was able to develop a cultivation system for measles virus and cultured an attenuated measles virus called the edmonston strain (named after the child from which it was isolated). the edmonston strain, though initially under-attenuated, was later adapted and led to the successfully license of a measles vaccine in 1963 [94] . maurice hilleman was able to build on the success of the live-attenuated measles vaccine and cultured and adapted by passage in fertilized hen's eggs, a strain of mumps called jeryl lynn (named after his daughter, from whom it was isolated) [95] . hilleman was later instrumental in the development of the mmr vaccine combining live-attenuated strains of measles, mumps, rubella (wistar ra 27/3 strain), which was first licensed for use in 1971 [96] . the early success of the measles and mumps vaccines prompted renewed efforts to develop vaccines to other pathogenic rna viruses. one of the greatest challenges to viral vaccine design remains the development of a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (rsv).respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) was first isolated in 1955 from a chimpanzee displaying upper respiratory illness [97] . since its identification, rsv has become recognized as the leading cause of infant mortality by a virus worldwide [98, 99] . in the united states alone, rsv upper and lower respiratory infections have led to over 100,000 hospitalizations annually [98] [99] [100] . despite a high clinical burden, no licensed rsv vaccines are available and current treatments are cost prohibitive while only providing passive immunity by administration of prophylactic antibodies [101] [102] [103] . the most susceptible population for rsv infection is young infants [98] [99] [100] . consequently, the ideal rsv vaccine must be immunogenic, genetically stable, and safe for vaccination in infants. however, an early tragic failure during the 1960's of a formalin-inactivated rsv vaccine has dampened efforts to develop and implement new vaccines [104, 105] . to date, the most clinically advanced rsv vaccine candidates have been live-attenuated viruses developed through virus passage and reconstitution by reverse genetics [106] [107] [108] . one of the more promising of these candidates to date has been medi-559, which includes many introduced mutations which render the virus temperature-sensitive and provides some level of protection [106, 107] . however, these candidates have not been able to achieve the level of protection and genetic stability necessary for implementation [109] . ongoing studies continue to evaluate new targets for attenuation; however successful development of an rsv vaccine will require finding the proper balance of attenuation and immunogenicity.orthomyxoviruses are enveloped, negative-sense rna viruses whose genomes consist of multiple linear segments and are approximately 12 to 15 kb in size. similar to paramyxoviruses, many orthomyxoviruses cause respiratory illnesses in humans, most notable is influenza (flu). a key hallmark of orthoymyxovirus evolution is the reassortment of the virus genomes through co-infection of a cell. in order to be transcriptionally active, influenza viruses require a functionally active viral ribonucleoprotein complex (rnp) which consists of the viral genomic rna, nucleoprotein (np), and the viral rdrp (comprised of pb1, pb2, and pa proteins) [110] . the first reverse genetics approaches developed for orthomyxoviruses were generated for influenza a virus (iav), however these systems utilized helper viruses that had to be selected against to recover recombinants [111, 112] . the first helper virus-free systems were developed around the turn of the millennium [113, 114] . these first systems required the co-transfection of four or more plasmids under the control of a pol ii promoter as well as eight plasmids expressing the eight viral rna segments. the number of plasmids co-transfected for recovery varied greatly depending upon the number of viral genomic segments and the organization of the helper protein constructs, ranging from 10 (which expressed two of the helper proteins on each of two plasmids using the pol ii promoter and an ires) to as many as 17 [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] . however, recent advances in the reverse genetics platforms have reduced the number of total plasmids needed to 8 or less using a bidirectional expression system [11, 12] . in this system, a human pol i promoter coupled with either a murine poli terminator drives viral rna synthesis and a cmv pol ii promoter is responsible for viral mrna synthesis [11] . this improved production of iav, however, generation of recombinant virus for vaccines is limited to a select number of mammalian cell lines such as african green monkey kidney epithelial cells (vero) or madin darby canine kidney (mdck) cells [119, 120] . however, these cell lines had limited transfectability and differences in pol i and pol ii compatibility have hindered the efficacy of these uni-and bidirectional approaches. incorporation of species-specific polymerase promoters has provided improved efficacy of recovery in several of these cell lines [119, 120] . a recent advancement has been the combination of up to 8 pol i driven iav genes on a single plasmid and up to 3 pol ii drive genes on an additional plasmid, this approach improves the probability of a single cell receiving all necessary plasmids during recovery [121] . the availability of applicable reverse genetics systems for studying and identifying the structure and function of influenza proteins has revolutionized influenza vaccination strategies.for many years, the trivalent vaccine that is currently provided consisted of three separated strains (2 a strains and 1 b strain), which were selected based on the who recommendations prior to the next flu season. however, these vaccines were made using either live-attenuated (through cold-adaptation) or inactivated virus grown in fertilized chicken eggs. next generation vaccination strategies include tetravalent or quadrivalent vaccines, which may be grown in animal cell cultures (rather than chicken eggs) or virus-like particles (vlps) in cultures of s. frugiperda insect (sf9) cells [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] . in 2013, the fda approved a seasonal influenza vaccine comprised of purified ha proteins prepared using a baculovirus-expression system [130] . these recombinant vaccines were successfully used to vaccinate individuals between 18 and 49 years of age and represents a major step in influenza vaccine design and implementation because this system reduces production time compared to the conventional egg-based approach [131] .a major frontier of synthetic biology is the development of new vaccines and therapeutics and the improvement of the implementation and efficacy of those already on the market. one major complication to the successful implementation of vaccines currently is the limitations in time between vaccine design and production. influenza viruses require seasonal vaccinations and determination of the proper formulations leaves little time for development and implementation. new advances in reverse genetics technology are reducing the potential time of recovery and production from months to weeks. for instance, dormitzer et al. have developed an improved platform approach and demonstrated that with current reverse genetics technology, it is feasible to generate a recombinant influenza virus from new ha and na sequences within 5 days [132] . as new emerging viruses continue to appear and pandemics continue to occur, rapid approaches to recover and adapt viruses will be instrumental in the public health response. development of common chimeric reverse genetic platforms for rapid cloning and expression of surface antigens from emergent pathogens will help increase the efficacy and timing of delivery during epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.one key limitation to the development of effective live-attenuated vaccines is genetic stability. rna viruses generally exhibit high mutation rates due to decreased fidelity of the rdrp. yet, recent studies have shown that codon-usage bias can be used to alter the translation and consequently, replication of viruses. several groups have shown that substituting non-preferred codons based on host cell codon usage bias, a process referred to as codon-deoptimization, into the genome of poliovirus resulted in reduction of plaque areas and virus yields [133, 134] . by changing codons rather than amino acids, the amount of viral protein may be modulated without impairment in its function. more importantly, the potential for reversion is greatly limited due to the sheer number of codon changes introduced into the coding sequence. this approach represents a promising new avenue to develop attenuated, but genetically stable vaccine platforms.despite the presence of reverse genetics systems for many human pathogens, not all have resulted in successful vaccine platforms. advances in biotechnology and key discoveries have led to novel reverse genetic approaches, which may be employed in new generation vaccines. structural vaccinology or structure-based antigen design has become a common practice for optimizing antigens for display in vaccines [135] . as mentioned previously, rsv remains a key hurdle to reducing viral childhood morbidity. since the discovery and implementation of palivizumab, currently the only licensed prophalytic inhibitory measure to rsv infection, considerable energy has been devoted to evaluating the antigenic sites of the rsv fusion (f) protein and optimizing f expression constructs for higher immunogenicity [105] . current structural vaccinology efforts to evaluate the pre-fusion and post-fusion antigenic forms of rsv f protein have led to the induction and identification of potent neutralizing antibodies with higher neutralizing potencies than palivizumab [136, 137] . the availability of new structures and sequences has made predictive structural modeling and structure-based antigen design viable options for renewed efforts at design of vaccines, for which no current vaccines exist.advances in biotechnology have shaped the field of virology as much as any other field of science. the capacity to engineer reverse genetics platforms for the study and manipulation of rna virus genomes has revolutionized the field of vaccine design. we have described here rna virus reverse genetic systems and past and current efforts to develop vaccines to provide immunity to several human rna virus pathogens. the incorporation of new advances in reverse genetics technology, adjuvants, non-human models of infection, and surveillance will continue to drive the development of next generation vaccines to pathogens for which we already have vaccination strategies as well as those that we currently do not. ongoing changes in human demographics and accessibility to health care are likely to modify cost-benefit analyses and provoke allocation of new resources for scientific study and development of vaccines. despite the ongoing evolution of vaccine design and implementation, the hallmarks of an effective viral vaccine will remain the same: high efficacy, safety, and stability. the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has led to over 10 million cases. covid-19 vaccines development is occurring with unprecedented speed. this is partially due to the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi). 1 cepi, formed in 2017, is a novel partnership between private, public, philanthropic and civil society organizations. it aims to develop vaccines for future epidemics and enable equitable access to vaccines for people during epidemics. cepi is mandated to accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccines against previously unknown pathogens with 16 weeks from identification of antigen to vaccine candidate release for clinical trials. 1 cepi has announced the initiation of nine covid-19 vaccine programs. 2 rapid response platforms for vaccine development supported by cepi are being utilized. platform technology use systems with the same basic components as a backbone and insert new protein or genetic sequences to adapt for use against different pathogens. 3 the vaccine candidates include a dna vaccine (administered with electroporation); a molecular-clamp vaccine (synthesis of viral surface proteins, which attach to host cells during infection and clamps them into shape, so that the immune system can recognize them as the correct antigen); recombinant protein nanoparticle technology to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike (s) protein (proprietary saponin-based adjuvant); a recombinant protein vaccine with the s trimer, a replicationdeficient simian adenoviral vaccine (chadox1-s); a measles-vector vaccine, a live-attenuated influenza vaccine and two mrna vaccines. a pandemic vaccine adjuvant will be available to enhance development. 2 cepi has also launched a call for organisations with large manufacturing capabilities for vaccine candidates, to advance an effective vaccine and transfer the vaccine platform to a global network of large-scale manufacturing. 2 there are currently 21 covid-19 vaccines candidates in clinical trials, including four funded by cepi (including the mrna (the first to enter clinical trials, co-developed with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid), usa), dna, chadox1-s and protein subunit vaccine) as shown in table i . 4, 5 most vaccine candidates are targeting the sars-cov spike (s) protein, 6,7 displayed on the virus surface, which is composed of two subunits. 6, 7 the s1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (rbd) that binds with the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), s protein priming occurs through the serine protease tmprss2 (to cleave s protein at s1/s2) and fusing of the viral and host membranes occurs through the s2 subunit. the s protein induces neutralizingantibody and t-cell responses, as well as protective immunity, during infection with sars-cov. 7 the vaccine formulation and delivery are being developed to induce strong neutralizing antibodies, predominant cd4 + t helper 1 cell (th1) immune response, and balanced cd4/cd8 and polyfunctional t cell responses, which have favorable antiviral properties. 7 the traditional timeline to develop a vaccine is 15 to 20 years. for covid-19, the hope is to have a vaccine available in 12-18 months.there are accelerated timelines for vaccine development to achieve who emergency use listing, while using regulatory pathways through national regulatory authorities. common adverse events that occur shortly after vaccination may be detected in the clinical trials, but rare adverse events, and those with delayed onset, are likely to be detected only once large populations are immunized.in addition, no dna or rna vaccines have been licensed in humans to date. safety surveillance accompanying deployment will be critical. historic example of real adverse reactions that are only detected after widespread vaccine use (guillain-barré syndrome (gbs) following the 1976 swine flu vaccine program and enhanced disease post infection after vaccination with the dengue vaccine) and coincidental events later found not be caused by the vaccine (autism following mmr vaccine and sudden infant death syndrome (sids) with whole cell pertussis vaccines) that undermine the immunization program, highlight the critical role for robust safety monitoring.adverse events of special interest (aesis) (serious or non-serious) are events of significant medical and scientific concern specific to the sponsor's program or product. these require ongoing monitoring and communication by the investigator to the sponsor and might require further investigation to characterize and understand them; and rapid communication by the trial sponsor to regulators. they could be related to vaccines in general, specific vaccine platforms or the disease. aesis reporting and assessment is done with high priority as they could change the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine or require prompt public communication. for the covid-19 vaccines, the aesis could potentially include vaccine-enhanced disease ( vaccination could make subsequent infection with sars-cov-2 more severe). 7 enhanced disease, with a few deaths, was associated with the dengue vaccine and had been reported with formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) vaccine in young children who received the vaccine and were subsequently infected with natural rsv in 1967. enhanced disease was seen in some preclinical studies withaesi. other aesis relevant to covid-19 disease could potentially include respiratory (including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome), cardiac (including cardiogenic shock, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, myocarditis and pericarditis),acute renal, and hepatic injury, , neurological (including encephalopathy, encephalitis, gbs, anosmia and ageusia), sepsis and septic shock, hypercoagulability, rhabdomyolysis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. 9 aesis related to novel adjuvants and vaccine platforms (e.g.cardiac ae including myo/pericarditis with mva, and arthritis with vsv platforms); and vaccination (e.g. anaphylaxis, thrombocytopenia, seizures, gbs) should also be considered.an adverse event following immunization (aefi) is "any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine". aefis include the background rate of all diseases post-vaccination and may include excess burden of these diseases if the vaccine causes a vaccine adverse reaction. safety surveillance must be capable of investigating aefis and aesis as our understanding of the biological mechanisms for adverse reactions has limitations and we must anticipate coincidental events that clinicians, the media and the public may attribute to the vaccine. safety surveillance must be able to detect and rapidly investigate aesis and aefis to determine if the temporal relationship is causal or coincidental.preparations need to be made now in order to ensure that emergency vaccine use in accompanied with robust vaccine safety surveillance and a process for safety assessment which will maintain public confidence in the vaccine. the vaccine will likely be used with covid-19 widely circulating. thus safety surveillance will need to distinguish between health outcomes caused by the disease versus those caused by the vaccine. real or coincidental aesis and aefis have the potential to undermine the vaccine program and exacerbate public fear around the pandemic.active and sentinel surveillance systems are necessary to rapidly and rigorously evaluate the safety profile of the vaccines. many high-income countries have large healthcare administrative databases to conduct such active surveillance and have vaccine experience. however, low-and middle-income countries (lmic) generally lack the capacity to conduct active safety surveillance and do not have large healthcare administrative databases. as equitable access to the vaccines for people during epidemics is imperative, active safety surveillance in lmic is critical to ensure that safety surveillance is also equitable.as was done prior to launch of the 2009-10 h1n1 vaccines, active surveillance systems should calculate the incidence of background rates of aesi prior to vaccine roll out. 10 establishing these background rates of disease prior to vaccination allows for a stable rate, based upon multiple years of data, so that the rates of these outcomes after vaccine roll out can be compared. cepi is developing a comprehensive list of aesis. the incidence of these outcomes will vary tremendously based upon the region, underlying population, and methods use for case ascertainment which will be highly dependent on the characteristics of the active or sentinel surveillance system. surveillance in lmic must be established now, in preparation for vaccine roll out, so that background rates of aesis can be calculated.there are several approaches that can be used to establish active surveillance systems in lmic.there is very limited access to large healthcare administrative databases in lmic. india it is also essential that countries and regions plan for real and coincidental aesis and aefis with a scientifically rigorous and publicly credible process to separate real adverse reactions from coincidental background rates of disease. safety signals require careful evaluation often involving chart review of potential cases, which can be both time and labor intensive. as recommended by the who global vaccine safety blueprint (gvsb 2.0), "countries or regions establish either a national expert committee for aefis or regional advisory committees or equivalent objective panels with spelled out terms of reference." 11 public credibility can be optimized by ensuring that these committees are "independent of conflicts of interest with the ministries of health, industry and the immunization program". vaccine safety communication plans, with clear national and subnational vaccine safety communication roles and responsibilities, should be developed to provide timely, evidence-based messaging to describe what is known, what is not known, and what is being done to fill these gaps.the covid-19 pandemic is a global crisis with enormous human and financial costs. present efforts aimed at curbing the pandemic through social distancing may be helpful. ultimately, a vaccine is likely the most important long-term tool. however, we must invest in active vaccine safety surveillance globally, and most particularly in lmic, to ensure the potential of a covid-19 vaccine is realized. with crisis comes opportunity to expand our global vaccine safety system to meet the needs of covid-19 and other routine and emergency use vaccines. the who global vaccine safety blueprint 2.0 offers the framework to do so and must be fully funded and implemented. emerging viral diseases (evds) have been making the headlines for the past two decades. each subsequent outbreak emphasizes the global lack of preparedness in controlling and minimizing the spread of these diseases to both human and animal populations. the burden of evds to public health and the global economy has been massive, with direct and indirect costs of zoonotic diseases estimated to exceed us$220 billion in the last decade alone, [1, 2] .this rise in evd cases can be traced to a number of causes. the growing global population, which is expected to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, has resulted in expanding urbanization and deforestation, exposing populations to reservoirs of new viruses. furthermore, high-density living conditions are often associated with low quality of life and insufficient health care, thus facilitating disease transmission. climate change also plays a major role by enabling emergence of infections in new locations, with warmer weather increasing the range of arthropod disease vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks. globalization and the dramatic growth of international travel also increase the rapidity and scale of emerging disease dissemination.of particular concern are the top seven priority pathogens designated by the world health organization (who) as likely to cause a major outbreak associated with high mortality rates due to the lack of effective medical treatments or countermeasures, [3] . these pathogens, all zoonotic, include the crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever virus (cchfv), ebola and marburg viruses (ebov), lassa virus (lasv), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), nipah virus (niv), and rift valley fever virus (rvfv). additionally, chikungunya virus (chikv) and zika virus (zikv) have been declared health emergencies with epidemic potential by the who [4] , despite their low mortality rates, as these mosquitoborne arboviruses can rapidly spread through large populations.zoonotic viruses can be transmitted directly to humans from their animal reservoirs. for example, niv can be acquired from bat shedding, mers-cov from camels, and sars-cov from civets [5] . alternately, transmission can occur through intermediate hosts such as niv infection of pigs followed by transmission to other pigs or humans [6] and ebov transmission from bats to non-human primates (nhps) and then to humans [7] . larger human outbreaks subsequently occur when individuals come in contact with body fluids (urine, saliva, aerosolized droplets or blood) of an infected person. air travel and trading ships carrying infected persons, animals or vectors can result in intercontinental spread of diseases and pandemics.several vaccine platforms have been developed for preventative care of these diseases and preparedness for future outbreaks. in this review, we will discuss the measles virus (mv) vector as a promising alternative to conventional vaccine development methods and how its strengths as a vaccination platform for these emerging diseases compare with other approaches. this platform is based on a replicating mv vaccine vector with demonstrated proof-ofprinciple in humans and a preclinical track record of rapid adaptability and effectiveness for a variety of pathogens.tackling the unpredictability regarding when and where evds will arise requires strong international disease surveillance networks as well as commitment to the development of preventative measures and post-exposure treatments. for this reason, in may 2015, the 68th world health assembly "welcomed the development of a blueprint for accelerating research and development in epidemics or health emergency situations where there are no, or insufficient, preventive, and curative solutions, taking into account other relevant work streams within who" [8] . the r&d blueprint aims to reduce the time between the declaration of an international public health emergency and the availability of effective tests, vaccines, antivirals, and other treatments that can save lives and avert a public health crisis. following that initiative, the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (http://cepi.net) was created. cepi is an alliance between governments, industry, academia, philanthropy, intergovernmental institutions, such as the who, and civil society that aims to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines to prevent and contain infectious disease epidemics. as epidemics disproportionately affect lowincome countries, cepi will ensure that the vaccines will be affordable and available to populations with the most need.there are currently no drugs available to efficiently treat acute virus infection. viral inhibitors such as ribavirin and others can reduce and slow down viral replication, giving the host immune system a chance to develop and clear the virus. however, the treatment window for acute viral infections is short and symptoms often only appear late in the course of infection, during the viral clearance phase (fig. 1 ) and after the host has become infectious. passive immunization can be used in emergency cases in high exposure areas, as seen with ebov [9] , niv [10] or hendra virus [11] outbreaks, but this approach is not practical for general implementation due to high cost and limited efficacy. therefore, prophylactic vaccination remains the most simple, safe and effective way to prevent viral infections and subsequent outbreaks.indeed, vaccines have been crucial to the control or elimination of many deadly viral diseases and represent the most efficient method to prevent viral infection. inactivated (killed) viruses, live attenuated viruses, and subunit vaccines comprise the conventional mode of vaccination. inactivated-virus vaccines are made of whole virus particles treated with chemicals, heat or radiation. live attenuated virus vaccines are created by passaging virulent virus strains in animals or cell culture until the virus has adapted to its new host and are no longer pathogenic in target animals or humans (usually after 5 to 100 or 200 passages). inactivated-virus and subunit vaccines are non-replication competent, so while there is no risk of reversion to infectivity, they are usually not effective enough to elicit strong host immune responses on their own. immunization efficacy requires the use of adjuvants and several boosters, which can in turn cause side effects and severe allergic reactions. on the other hand, live attenuated vaccines elicit longterm protective immune responses because they can replicate inside the host. however, depending on the number of attenuation mutations and on the viral family, there is a risk of reversion where virulence can be regained through reassortment with pathogenic strains, as observed with the oral live polio vaccine [12] . moreover, the conventional attenuation is a lengthy process requiring numerous passages that can take from 6 months to several years of work, rendering it impractical as a prompt response to ongoing outbreaks.nevertheless, given their efficacy, simple administration regimens, and ease in large-scale manufacture, live attenuated vaccines remain attractive choices for vaccine design. highly successful examples of live attenuated vaccines include those developed against smallpox, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, and measles, with the latter three being successfully implemented in low-and middle-income countries through the expanded program on immunization (epi). well-tested and effective live attenuated virus vaccines can be modified with modern recombinant dna technology to combine the advantages of replicating viral vectors with the need for rapid methods of developing new vaccines for emerging or re-emerging diseases. live replicating vectors, such as the mv vector, are characterized by induction of long-lived protective immunity after one or two administrations. with reverse genetics technology, a viral vector vaccine platform can be created to carry antigenic proteins from another circulating virus to yield a vaccine candidate that can be quickly tested in established animal models. such a "plug-andplay" platform has the capacity to provide rapid responses to future emerging viral diseases. ranging from 150 to 350 nm due to the flexibility of envelope structure. inside the particles, the genomic viral rna is tightly wrapped with n, p and l to constitute a helicoidal ribonucleoprotein (rnp) complex, which is auto-replicative in the host cytoplasm. the rnp serves as the template for viral rna synthesis, and with each n molecule associated with 6 nucleotides, efficient replication requires that the genome length respects the so-called 'rule of six', which means that the total number of genome nucleotides is dividable by 6 [13] . since the helicoidal structure is highly flexible like a spring, the genome tolerates large insertions as long as the total length complies with the 'rule of six'. viral genes are transcribed in succession from the n to l genes as the polymerase stops and restarts at intergenic regions. however, as efficiency of re-initialization is not 100%, mrnas are produced in decreasing amounts from the 5 0 to 3 0 end of the genome, resulting in the greatest abundance of n and lowest abundance of l protein. accumulation of intracellular n protein promotes a shift from transcription to replication. during replication, l synthesizes a complete copy of the entire genome as a positive-sense antigenome which serves as the template for generation of full-length negative-sense genomes for packaging. viral particles are assembled with the n, p and l proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm before budding from the plasma membrane together with envelope proteins localized to the surface membrane.live attenuated mv vaccine is one of the safest and most effective vaccines available. several mv vaccine strains, such as the schwarz/moraten, edmonston-zagreb, and aik-c strains, have been developed from the pathogenic wild-type virus by multiple passages in various cellular substrates (chicken eggs, chicken embryo fibroblasts) under different conditions. in the past 40 years, the mv vaccine has been administered safely to over 2 billion children, with no case of reversion reported. it induces both humoral and cellular immune responses by efficiently stimulating long-lasting memory be and t-cells and provides lifelong immunity. it has an efficacy rate of approximately 93% after one administration and 97% after two administrations. the virus only replicates in the cytoplasm, hence there are no possibility of viral genome integration into the host genome. thanks to its nonsegmented negative-sense rna genome, there is no genomic recombination possible or observed with other viruses. furthermore, the mv vaccine is currently produced on a large scale in many countries and is globally distributed at low cost through the epi. therefore, the mv vector platform provides a means of rapidly generating potent vaccine candidates against a broad spectrum of epidemic disease targets, and its accessible manufacturing process provides a means to rapidly scale-up vaccines at low cost for stockpiling purposes and as a rapid response vaccine countermeasure to epidemic threats.recombinant mv vectors generated from attenuated mv vaccine strains are attractive choices for developing vaccine candidates against other viral infections. due to the helicoidal packaging of its genome, an mv vector can take up foreign genes up to 6 kb in size and possibly more. heterologous proteins can be stably expressed at high levels for more than 12 passages and rescued recombinant viruses retain growth capabilities similar to the original mv strain [14] . the mv delivery platform has been developed from its preclinical stages to clinical proof-of-concept for several indications with a preclinical track record of fast and effective adaptability to a variety of pathogens. mv vectors are immunogenic in mice and nhps, inducing long-term neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity even in the context of preexisting immunity to the vector [15e18].the initial and pioneer cloning of full-length infectious mv was achieved in 1995 by the group of m. billeter in zurich [19] . later, the schwarz strain of mv was cloned at institut pasteur (paris) as it is a commercially and who approved, mostly attenuated, efficient and widely used mv vaccine strain [20] . to generate an infectious clone, its full-length antigenomic viral cdna (fig. 2b) was cloned into the ptm plasmid under the control of the t7 rna promoter. dna sequences containing a ggg motif, hammerhead and hepatitis delta viral ribozymes were added to facilitate accurate cleavage of the viral rna and ensure production of fulllength viral rna. the virus can be produced or rescued by transfection of ptm-mvschw plasmid together with a plasmid expressing the schwarz mv l gene into trans-complemented human cells (hek293 cells constitutively expressing t7 rna polymerase, mv n and mv p). transfected cells are then further cocultured with any mv permissive cell line such as vero, mrc5 or chicken embryonic fibroblasts. plaques are picked and seeded for amplification and characterization. rescued viruses from the cdna clone possess the same sequence as the parental schwarz strain, demonstrating the stability of the negative-sense genome. to enable insertion of foreign antigens, several additional transcription units (atus) based on mv cis-acting sequences were introduced into ptm-mvschw at various sites in the genome. cloning sites can accommodate inserts of over 6 kb in length, in multiples of six base pairs to respect the 'rule of six' that is essential for measles genome replication [13] .one common concern regarding the use of mv as a vaccine vector is preexisting immunity, due to the broad coverage of mv vaccines in human populations worldwide. however, it was demonstrated that recombinant mv vaccines induce strong immune responses even in previously immunized animals or humans [15, 21, 22] . although surprising, a few mv properties may account for this phenomenon. first, recombinant mv are replicating, therefore although low doses are used, the vaccine is amplified in vivo. upon cell infection, the recombinant mv expresses measles proteins as well as heterologous antigens, and mv particles are assembled and released from the cell. heterologous antigens are either secreted from the cell or expressed on the cell surface, depending on the nature of the antigen, and stimulate the immune response. second, the virus delivers antigens directly to dendritic cells, macrophages and b cells (the most effective antigen presenting cells), and viral particles are transmitted from cell to cell by cell contacts. lastly, we have recently shown that additional antigens expressed from replicating mv vectors are naturally adjuvanted through defective interfering genomes produced by the recombinant virus, contributing to robust induction of interferon and conferring vaccine efficacy [23] .this vaccine technology platform has the capacity to address the challenge of rapid vaccine development, combining a strong safety and immunogenicity profile demonstrated through multiple applications, the ability to target antigens from infectious pathogens in preclinical and clinical settings, and a robust, antigen-independent, scalable manufacturing process. several recombinant measles vaccines against a number of viral pathogens have so far been generated and tested in animal models (fig. 3) . target pathogens include hiv [24,15,25,16,17,26e28] , west nile virus (wnv) [29, 30] , dengue virus (denv) [31, 32] , hepatitis b virus (hbv) [33] , human papilloma virus (hpv) [34] , chikv [21] , niv [35] , respiratory syncytia virus (rsv) [36] , sars-cov [37] , mers-cov [18] , h5n1 influenza a virus (iav) (unpublished), zikv (unpublished), lasv (unpublished) and ebov (unpublished). preclinical immunogenicity and protection from lethal challenges have been shown in mice and nhps for wnv, chikv, hiv-1, sars-cov, h5n1 iav, zikv, and lasv. in the cases of hiv-1, zikv, and chikv, recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully completed phase i clinical trials in adults, with the last progressing to phase ii trials.chikungunya virus (chikv) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus in the family of alphaviridae. approximately 30% of infected patients develop debilitating chronic polyarthralgia that can last months or even years. initially thought of as an african virus, it emerged in 2005e2006 on la reunion island in the indian ocean, infecting a third of the island population, before spreading throughout india, giving rise to the indian ocean lineage. in 2013, it reemerged on the caribbean island of martinique. since then, chikv has been found in over 60 countries in the americas, africa, asia, and europe, with more than 1.7 million people infected.an mv-based chikv vaccine has been developed expressing chikv structural genes (c, e3, e2, 6k, e1) cloned from the clinical isolate chikv 06.49 (ecsa strain) [21] . expression of chikv structural genes results in formation of virus-like particles during infection in vero cells. preclinical studies in cd46þ/ifnarà/à mice showed full protection from lethal chikv challenge after a single immunization, even in presence of preexisting immunity to the vector [21] . the mv-chikv vaccine candidate was further introduced into clinical trials by themis bioscience (http://themisbio. com). immunogenicity was demonstrated in phase i clinical trial with a 90% seroconversion rate after a single injection and 100% seroconversion after boosting (28 days or 3 months apart) [22] . there were no serious adverse reactions observed; even the group receiving a high dose (3 â 10 5 tcid 50 ) displayed only mild reactions such as headache, flu-like symptoms and mild muscle pain, similar to those observed with the control standard mv vaccine [22] . most importantly, the study demonstrated that the immune response to measles and chikv vlp was not dampened by previous mv immunization since all volunteers were preimmune to measles [22] . the phase ii clinical trial is ongoing with 400 volunteers in austria and germany (eudract no. 2013-001084-23). additionally, two independent phase i studies have been initiated in the usa (nih) and puerto rico (dod) in june 2017 (clinicaltrials.gov: nct03028441, nct02861586). the success of mv-chikv thus far reaffirms that the mv vector is an excellent platform for vaccine development.dengue virus (denv) is an enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded rna virus in the family flaviviridae that causes a tropical disease endemic in southeast asia and latin america. who identified dengue as a neglected disease with potential for emergence in new geographical areas due to climate change [3] . the major complication of dengue infection is that four distinct serotypes of the virus circulate. after the first denv infection, the host acquires life-long immunity to that particular serotype, but this does not provide cross-protection against other serotypes. rather, nonneutralizing antibodies enhance infection of cells carrying the fc receptors used by denv for host cell entry. this phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) [38, 39] . due to ade complications, the strategy for denv vaccine development is to focus on tetravalent vaccines that simultaneously stimulate immune responses against all four denv serotypes.the recently licensed denv vaccine dengvaxia (cyd-tdv) is a tetravalent yf17d-based recombinant vaccine that has completed phase 3 clinical trials and is now distributed in southeast asia and south america [40] . however, the vaccine poses a safety concern associated with increased risk of disease exacerbation in recipients who have not been previously exposed to denv. sanofi has pulled the vaccine from the philippines after recent concerns, and vaccine use is recommended only for individuals with prior exposure to denv.given the limitations of the current vaccine, other options are still being explored. an mv-based tetravalent vaccine candidate is in development as well. the denv antigen used consists of domain iii of the e glycoprotein (ediii) from each of the four serotypes, as it contains serotype-specific neutralizing epitopes, fused to the ectodomain of the membrane protein (m) [32] . this m ectodomain is essential for immunogenicity of the inserted tetravalent ediii due to its adjuvant properties through induction of pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines and chemokines [31] . preclinical trials revealed that immunized mice and macaques developed neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes (unpublished data).zika virus (zikv) is a flavivirus closely related to denv, with approximately 40% amino acid difference compared to the 30e35% difference between the four denv serotypes [41, 42] . zikv was first identified among humans, primates, and mosquitoes in the zika forest of uganda in 1947 [43] . in 1969, it emerged in southeast asia and became largely endemic in tropical regions. the first massive outbreak was seen on yap island in 2007, where more than 70% of the population became infected. in 2017, the disease reached latin america with a major outbreak in brazil.zikv infection shares some common symptoms with other arbovirus infections such as fever, flu-like symptoms, and rashes. in the brazilian outbreak, around half of the cases exhibited no symptoms but the virus could be detected in the saliva of infected individuals [44] . zikv was declared an emergency public health concern by the who in 2016 due to neurological complications associated with guillain barr e syndrome (as reported in french polynesia) and microcephaly in newborns (as reported in brazil) [45] . congenital zikv syndromes suggested human-to-human transmission through sexual intercourse, breast milk or placental transfer [46, 47] .with its close evolutionary relationship to denv, ade between both viruses has been reported in vitro; sera of denv-infected individuals facilitate zikv infection in usually non-permissive cells [48] . although not confirmed in humans, this phenomenon could complicate vaccine development against zikv and denv. vaccines currently in preclinical trials include an mv-based vaccine, which was developed by cloning the full-length prm and e genes (prm-e) of zikv into the ptm-mvschw vector. this vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic and conferred full protection to both mice and monkeys. a phase i clinical trial was initiated in 2017 (themis bioscience, http://themisbio.com).severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded rna viruses possessing genomes approximately 27.9 and 30.1 kb in size respectively. while both viruses are thought to originate from bats, the first known case of sars occurred through transmission from a palm civet [49] in foshan, china in november 2002 before spreading throughout china and to other countries. who tallied 8096 reported cases in 27 countries in 2003. due to a global effort in disease management, the outbreak was declared to be over by july of that year. ten years after the first sars incidence, mers-cov emerged in saudi arabia in 2012, with cases arising from transmission from dromedary camels to humans. as mers-cov has not been observed to spread from person to person like sars-cov, a localized outbreak arising from an imported case was observed only in south korea as a result of nosocomial transmission from a single infected traveler [50] .the structural spike (s) proteins of covs have been identified as targets for neutralizing antibodies and are considered potential targets for subunit and viral vector vaccine development. at institut pasteur, an mv-based vaccine against sars-cov has been developed where a human codon-optimized gene encoding the native sars-cov s or its soluble form was inserted into the atu between the p and m sequences of ptm-mvschw [37] . these gene insertions did not interfere with recombinant mv growth and titer. the vaccine was tested in mice and found to induce neutralizing antibodies. all immunized animals were protected from a lethal dose of sars-cov challenge delivered intranasally. native s was observed to be more potent in eliciting antibodies than its soluble counterpart, and these antibodies were found to possess high neutralizing activity against both sars-cov and mv [51] . higher igg2a than igg1 levels were observed, suggesting a th1-biased response.for mers-cov, an mv-based vaccine has been generated using a modified edmonston strain backbone carrying either the fulllength or soluble mers-cov s between the p and m genes [18] . like the sars-cov version, this vaccine also induced neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific cytotoxic t-cells. both elispot assays and intracellular cytokine staining by flow cytometry showed strong increase in specific cd3 þ cd8 þ t cells from vaccinated mice after ex vivo restimulation with the s antigen, as well as a positive killing assay [18] . the promising results thus far demonstrate that the mv vector has great potential for further sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine development.ebola and marburg viruses (ebov and marv) are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded rna viruses in the filoviridae family responsible for hemorrhagic fevers associated with high fatality rates of up to 50%. ebov was first discovered in 1976 in congo and sudan. its circulation has generally been restricted to central african countries where several ebov strains and marv cause frequent outbreaks. they continue to cause sporadic outbreaks, re-emerging regularly in eastern and central africa. in december 2013, however, an unprecedented outbreak emerged in the western african country of guinea, causing a major crisis with its rapid spread within the country as well as to the neighboring sierra leone and liberia. air travel led to imported cases in many countries (us, spain, mali and uk), turning the ebov epidemic into a global public health emergency. from 2013 to 2016, who documents indicate a total of 28,464 reported cases of ebov infection with 11,323 reported deaths. while a concerted international effort managed to stem the outbreak, ebov outbreaks are predicted to persist into the next decade [52] .this recent outbreak re-energized ebov vaccine development with a massive influx of funding, and several vaccine candidates were placed in accelerated development. among them were two viral-vector vaccines targeting the envelope glycoprotein (gp) of ebov, which are currently in phase ii/iii clinical trials. the first vaccine is based on the vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) vector expressing the ebov zaire strain gp (rvsv-zebov) [53, 54] . this vector is based on a cattle virus not frequently associated with human infection. nhp experiments demonstrated that this vaccine protects against ebov challenge and is also effective as postinfection treatment within a few days of infection. drawbacks of the rvsv-zebov vaccine include unknown duration of protection and possible adverse effects depending on the dose used. a phase i clinical trial was abruptly stopped due to serious joint pain and dermatitis [55] . for now, however, the vaccine has proven effective in limiting disease spread when implemented in a "ring vaccination" scheme in guinea [56, 57, 55] .the second vaccine candidate against ebov is an adenovirus vector (ad) expressing ebov-gp. this vaccine vector provides the benefit of being non-pathogenic to humans and is naturally controlled by the immune system. however, the first generation of ad-based vaccines had reduced effectiveness due to pre-existing immunity, which was later overcome by the use of a chimpanzee adenovirus strain (chad) [58] . regardless of preexisting immunity, to confer a long-lasting immunity, huad and chad platforms require a booster delivered by a heterologous modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) vector. prime-boost protocols are difficult to set up in ebov-emerging countries where healthcare systems are weak and unavailable in some areas. moreover, the dose required for efficient protection is 10 11 tcid 50 , a highly challenging task for manufacturing a vaccine for millions of individuals.the mv vector provides an attractive alternative for vaccine development that can circumvent possible safety issues associated with the rvsv vector and the manufacturing hurdles and complex regimen of the adv vector approach. in particular, mv ability to elicit both humoral and cellular responses will be advantageous for efficient protection, as t-cell responses have been shown to play some role in controlling ebov infection [59] and will probably be instrumental for maintaining long-term memory. furthermore, the large insertion capacity of the mv vector enables development of a combined vaccine against both ebov and marv. mv expressing different forms of gp of ebov (zaire strain) are currently being tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in the nhp model at institut pasteur.lassa virus (lasv) is a bi-segmented, negative-sense, singlestranded rna virus in the family arenaviridae that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. the natal multimammate rat is its natural reservoir, with most infections occurring by rodent-to-human transmission. human-to-human spread can occur through direct contact of infected body fluids and in nosocomial settings. lassa fever causes non-specific symptoms but in severe cases, vascular leakage and multi-organ failure have been reported. the disease was first identified in nigeria in 1969 and was detected throughout western and central africa within a decade. unlike ebov infection, lassa fever occurs annually, posing a major threat to local populations, travelers and healthcare workers. the us cdc estimates that lasv causes 100,000e300,000 cases and 5000 deaths yearly. among hemorrhagic fever viruses, lasv causes the highest global burden due to its stability and aerosol transmission, which also render it a potential bioterrorism threat.several virus-based vectors including vsv [60] , vaccinia virus [61] and yellow fever virus (yf17d) [62] carrying the surface glycoprotein complex (gpc) of lasv showed promising immunological results in guinea pig and nhp models. ninety percent of nhp survived lethal lasv challenge after vaccination with vaccinia-lasv-gp [61] . this study also confirmed that cell-mediated immune responses are key to lasv protection. however, use of the vaccinia-based vaccine is not desirable for the high hiv prevalence regions of africa, as it is still unclear whether immunosuppressed individuals face risks of increased vaccinia replication and generalized infection. on the other hand, the yf17d vector expressing lasv-gpc was observed to exhibit genetic instability of the antigen due to the vector's small insertion capacity [62] . various versions of the gp1 and gp2 glycoproteins were tested in yf17d to resolve this issue, but loss of antigen expression was still observed after five passages of the recombinant virus.an mv-based vaccine, mv-lasv-npþgpc, is currently being developed at institut pasteur with no problem of antigen instability due to the high insertion capacity of this vector. experiments in macaques have shown the great efficacy of this vaccine candidate to protect the animals after a single immunization from lethal lasv challenge (unpublished data).nipah virus (niv) is a henipavirus in the paramyxoviridae family. it is an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded rna virus that causes disease in both humans and animals. its reservoir is the fruit bat, and transmission occurs through contact with bat saliva or urine, often through consumption of contaminated fruits or date palm sap. the disease first emerged with a fatal case of acute encephalitis in the town of nipah in malaysia in 1998, and was followed by a few hundred cases of disease with over 30% mortality. the virus re-emerged in india and bangladesh in 2001e2008 with a higher fatality rate of 70e100%. pigs act as amplifying hosts, where infection causes mostly respiratory symptoms and is known as the "barking pig disease". direct transmission from infected pigs to humans has been reported [6] . in addition, the fact that a number of infected patients never came into contact with either bats or pigs indicates occurrence of human-to-human transmission of niv [63, 64] .vaccine target antigens for niv are its fusion protein (f) and glycoprotein (g), which are the surface proteins important for host cell attachment and viral entry. the various immunization strategies have been summarized in a previous review [11] . canarypox virus carrying f and g was developed for use in animals and showed protection against intranasal challenge in piglets [65] . for human vaccination, vaccinia virus, adenovirus, mv and vsv [10, 35, 66, 67] have all been used as viral vectors. these vaccine candidates all elicited specific neutralizing antibodies and protected against challenge in hamster and ferret models, with vsv-niv-g demonstrating partial protection against lethal challenge in nhps as well, although some lesions were observed in brain cells suggesting viral replication in the central nervous system [68] .the mv-based vaccine involved insertion of the niv g gene into the edmonston strain-based vector. initial immunogenicity testing was performed in hamsters and showed full protection from lethal challenge after the second immunization. in nhp model, monkeys were vaccinated with 1 â 10 5 tcid 50 of rmv-niv-g with one booster and showed no clinical signs after challenge with niv, demonstrating full protection in vaccinated monkeys [35] .rift valley fever virus (rvfv) is a phlebovirus with a trisegmented, negative-sense, single-stranded rna genome. it is transmitted by several aedes spp. and culex spp. mosquitoes to livestock and humans. infection causes acute severe disease in ruminants with fever, loss of appetite, aborted fetuses and a high mortality rate in newborn animals. humans are dead-end hosts, and infection results in a febrile illness with approximately 1% of those infected presenting with more severe symptoms such as encephalitis or hemorrhagic syndromes. it first appeared in the rift valley region of kenya and the virus itself was isolated in 1930. several major outbreaks were reported throughout africa, before first appearing outside the region in 2000 with a large outbreak in the arabian peninsula.the three segments of the rvfv genome have been named the small (s), medium (m) and large (l) genes. the two envelope glycoproteins (gn or gc) serve as receptor-binding proteins to facilitate virus attachment and infection, rendering them targets for vaccine development. subunit vaccines targeting gn or gc have been shown to elicit specific rvfv neutralizing antibodies [69] .many vaccine platforms have been used to develop vaccine candidates for rvfv. while there are no licensed vaccines for humans available yet, animal vaccines include the live attenuated smithburn and inactivated rvfv in africa [70] . unfortunately, these are not diva (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) vaccines, which can present a problem for the export of livestock and its products. among the vaccines in the pipeline, clinical trials have been conducted for formalin-inactivated and attenuated vaccines, and these have demonstrated seroconversion and longterm protection against rvfv in both animals and humans [71, 72] . nevertheless, the attenuated vaccine retains the risk of reversion through reassortment with field strains.while an mv vector has not yet been used in the development of an rvfv vaccine, considering the drawbacks of the current vaccine options and candidates, its advantages provide a strong argument to pursue this approach. furthermore, mv has been shown to infect animals through the nectin4 receptor without requiring cd46 (unpublished) making this platform viable for animal vaccines as well.the mv platform is highly flexible, enabling easy modification to create a replicating delivery vector for various protective antigens. this platform benefits of the advantages of live attenuated vaccines without the risks and drawbacks. this "plug-and-play" property will help ensure the timely availability of preventive vaccines whenever a new epidemic occurs. the platform has a track record in safety and immunogenicity for other relevant antigens and pathogens and a well-established production process that allows substantial acceleration in development timelines. the various mvvectored vaccines that have demonstrated solid performance in early phase clinical trials provide proof-of-concept that the mv platform is a powerful tool in the fight against current and emerging viral pathogens.middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) has emerged as a novel lethal human pathogen which causes severe acute respiratory infection since its identification in plos one | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220196 july 22, 2019 1 / 20 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111saudi arabia in 2012 [1] . the virus causes respiratory diseases such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may lead to pneumonia and acute renal failure in immunocompromised patients and the elderly [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . to date, 2,266 laboratory-confirmed mers-cov infection cases including 804 related deaths from 27 countries have been reported to world health organization (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). currently, such cases are increasingly being reported. mers-cov also has the potential for a widespread outbreak, as observed in 2015 in south korea [8] . currently, the lack of prophylactic or therapeutic measures has created an urgent need for effective vaccine the development against mers-cov infections [9, 10] . mers-cov is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded rna virus that belongs to lineage c of the genus betacoronavirus (β-cov) in the family coronaviridae [11] [12] [13] . the mers-cov genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (s), envelope (e), membrane (m), and nucleocapsid (n) [14, 15] . the s protein, a type i transmembrane glycoprotein on the virus surface, contains two functional subunits and mediates viral infection. the s1 subunit comprises n-terminal domain (ntd) and receptor-binding domain (rbd) that recognizes and binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4, also known as cd26) receptor on the host cell surface to initiate infection [16] [17] [18] . the s2 subunit with two heptad repeats (hr), hr1 and hr2, facilitates fusion between the virus and host cell membrane [19, 20] . the s glycoprotein is considered as a suitable vaccine candidate for eliciting neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry or neutralize viral infection [21] [22] [23] .the spike protein-based vaccine candidates have been developed and investigated, such as whole-inactivated virus [24] , subunit vaccines [22, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , dna-based vaccines [27, 30, 31] , and viral vector-based vaccines [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , using both the spike protein as a whole and spike protein fragments. these vaccine candidates induced humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses. however, a vaccination strategy focused on rbd alone has several issues that may not be optimal for generating neutralizing antibody responses [27] and can only induce partial protection against the mers-cov infection [29, 37] . detailed structural analysis revealed that rbd-specific antibodies stimulate the emergence of viral escape mutation in this region; therefore, the generation of more diverse antibodies directed toward both rbd and outside the domain may be a better strategy for developing effective vaccines [27, 38] .here, we designed and constructed recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine candidates encoding ntd, rbd, and full-length spike protein. we assessed their immunogenicity and compared immune responses generated from vaccination via different routes and found that rad/spike could induce the strongest humoral and cellular immune responses. additionally, immunization with rad/spike conferred long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses, suggesting that rad/spike is the best candidate for an effective mers-cov vaccine development.female balb/c mice aged 6 weeks were purchased from orient bio inc. (seoul, korea). all mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions in the experimental facility at ewha woman's university. all mice were group housed in cages, containing four mice each, at approximately 22˚c with 12 h light/dark cycle. cage changes were performed once weekly until the end of the experiment, and food and water were replenished as needed. during the study, mice were checked daily to ensure health and animal welfare. all mice were sacrificed by co 2 euthanasia. all animal studies were approved by ewha woman's university institutional animal care and use committee (iacuc; approval no. 18-005) and carried out under strict compliance with the suggestions given by the institute of laboratory animal resources guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.hek293 cells (atcc crl-1573) were cultured in mem (welgene, korea) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (fbs). 293tn cells and huh7.5 cells were purchased from atcc collection (manassas, va) and were grown in dmem (welgene) supplemented with 10% fbs. spodoptera frugiperda 21 (sf-21) insect cells (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) were propagated in sf-900 ii serum-free medium (gibco brl) at 28˚c and used to produce a recombinant ntd (rntd) protein.normal human nasal epithelial (nhne) cells were cultured as described previously [39] . briefly, passage-2 nhne cells (1×10 5 cells/culture) were seeded in 0.25 ml of culture medium on transwell clear culture inserts (24.5-mm, with a 0.45-mm pore size; costar co., cambridge, ma, usa). cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of basal epithelial growth medium and dmem containing previously described supplements. cultures were grown while submerged for the first 9 days. the culture medium was changed on day 1, and every other day thereafter. an air-liquid interface (ali) was created on day 9 by removing the apical medium and feeding the cultures from the basal compartment only. the culture medium was changed daily after the initiation of the ali. we add antibiotics such as 1% penicillin and streptomycin into the all media for subculture and culture stages and we also add antifungal agent, fungizone (1 ml/ 1,000 ml media) (life technologies, grand island, ny, usa) after filtering the media. all experiments described here used cultured nasal epithelial cells at 14 days after the creation of the ali.the amino acid sequence of the mers-cov spike protein was from mers-cov/kor/knih/ 002_05_2015 (genbank kt029139, residues 1-1353). spike gene was codon-optimized and synthesized for mammalian cell expression (genscript, piscataway, nj). an optimal kozak translation sequence was also included immediately upstream of atg. this synthetic dna was subcloned into a pshuttle-cmv vector through bglii/noti double digestion and used as templates for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. subsequently, constructs expressing different mers-cov spike protein fragments were designed. the coding sequence for rbd (residues 367-606) was amplified by pcr using the forward (5'-gagctagcgaggc caagccctctggc-3') and reverse primers (5'-gactcgagttatcacttgtcatcatcg tccttgtagtcgtactccacgcaattgcccag-3'), which contain two stop codons and a flag tag sequence. the coding sequence for ntd (residues 18-353) was amplified by pcr using the forward (5'-ga gctagctacgtcgatgtgggacc-3') and reverse primers (5'-gactcgagttatcagtggtggtggtggtgatgggactcatagctacagtgcag-3') which contain two stop codons and a six-histidine tag sequence. finally, the pcr products of rbd and ntd gene were inserted into the pshuttle-cmv vector through nhei/xhoi double digestion, respectively. the pshuttle-cmv plasmid was designed to include the start codon and the signal sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) upstream of the transgene sequence. replication-defective adenoviruses (serotype 5) were generated by inserting foreign sequences via homologous recombination and subsequent purification of recombinant adenovirus (rad), as described previously [40] . briefly, the shuttle vector plasmid was electroporated into electrocompetent bj5183 cells carrying the padeasy-1 adenoviral genomic dna. recombinant adenoviral dna was isolated and linearized with paci and subsequently transfected into hek293 cells to generate rad/spike, rad/rbd, and rad/ntd viruses. mock adenovirus (rad/mock) was generated by the same method using the empty pshuttle-cmv vector. the recombinant viruses were amplified on hek293 cells and purified by double-cesium chloride (cscl 2 ) gradient ultracentrifugation. the expression and secretion of spike and rbd proteins by rad-infected hek293 cells were verified via western blot analysis by employing anti-mers-cov s1 protein rabbit polyclonal antibody [amino acids (aa) 1-725; 40069-t48; sino biological inc., beijing, china] and hrp-conjugated goat anti-rabbit igg antibody (abcam, cambridge, uk). the expression and secretion of ntd protein were validated by infecting hek293 cells and by conducting western blot analysis using rad/spike-immunized mouse serum (1:1,000 dilution) and hrp-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse igg antibody (abcam) as a secondary antibody.female balb/c mice aged 6-8 weeks were immunized with rad vaccine or control virus via intranasal (in), intramuscular (im), and sublingual (sl) routes. for in immunization, mice were lightly anesthetized via isoflurane (ifran; hana pharm., kyonggi-do, korea) inhalation, and 50 μl of vaccine or control virus solution was inoculated into the left nostril. for im immunization, 100 μl of the vaccine was injected on the right hind leg of mice. for sl immunization, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 mg/kg body weight ketamine (yuhan co., seoul, korea) and 10 mg/kg body weight rompun (bayer, seoul, korea) mixture in pbs, and subsequently, 15 μl vaccine was inoculated under their tongue. blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus using a heparinized capillary tube; further, blood samples were centrifuged and sera were obtained and stored at −70˚c. mice were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 19 weeks after undergoing the last immunization, and tracheotomy was performed. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) was collected by washing the lung airways with 1 ml pbs. balf was centrifuged and the supernatant was used to measure secretory iga and neutralizing antibody titers.the rntd protein was prepared using a bac-to-bac baculovirus expression system (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. the ntd gene amplified by pcr, as described above, was cloned into the pfastbac1 vector with a 5'-terminal tpa for protein secretion. this expression cassette was inserted into the baculovirus genome within dh10bac (invitrogen). the recombinant bacmid-encoding ntd (rbac-ntd) plasmid was transfected into sf-21 cells using cellfectin transfection reagent (invitrogen). the primary recombinant baculovirus was harvested 5 days after transfection and then amplified by infecting into new large-scale sf-21 cell cultures. to obtain the rntd protein, final culture supernatants of infected sf-21 cells were collected and loaded onto a 5-ml histrap hp column (ge healthcare) with a binding buffer (20 mm kpo 4 , 500 mm nacl, 10 mm imidazole, ph 7.4). the column was washed with binding buffer and eluted using an elution buffer (20 mm kpo 4 , 500 mm nacl, 500 mm imidazole, ph 7.4). after removing most impurities, the eluted target protein fractions were pooled, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged with pbs. purified rntd protein concentration was determined using the nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (thermo fisher scientific).the antigen-specific igg and iga antibody titers in immunized mice were determined by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). briefly, 96-well plates (nunc maxisorp; thermo fisher scientific) were coated with 200 ng/well of s1 (aa 1-725; 40069-v08b1), s2 (aa 726-1296; 40070-v08b), rbd (aa 367-606; 40071-v08b1) (sino biological inc.), or rntd (aa 18-353) of mers-cov spike protein in 100 μl pbs and incubated overnight at 4˚c. each antigen-coated well was blocked with pbs containing 1% non-fat milk and 0.05% tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature (rt). subsequently, serial dilutions of sera or balfs were added into the well and incubated for 2 h at rt. after washing with pbs containing 0.05% tween 20, hrp-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse igg (abcam) or hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse iga (zymed laboratories, san francisco, ca) was added as a secondary antibody and incubated for 1 h at rt under dark conditions. the plates were washed, and the reaction was developed with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) peroxidase substrate (kpl, gaithersburg, md); gradually, the reaction was stopped with 1 m h 3 po 4 and analyzed at 450 nm wavelength using thermo multiskan ex (vantaa, finland).the gfp-expressing lentiviral transfer plasmid was constructed using plenti6 gateway vector kits (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. the full-length mers-cov spike protein-expressing envelope plasmid was constructed by inserting a codon-optimized synthetic dna sequence (genscript) into pcagg plasmid (addgene, www.addgene.org). to produce mers-cov spike pseudotyped lentivirus, 293tn cells were co-transfected with packaging plasmids plp1 and plp2, the lentiviral transfer plasmid, and the envelope plasmid pcagg/mers-cov spike using lipofectamine 2000 transfection regent (invitrogen). after overnight incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh 10% dmem. fortyeight hours later, culture supernatants containing pseudovirus were collected, centrifuged to remove debris, passed through 0.45-μm filter, and stored at −70˚c.huh 7.5 cells (30,000 cells per well) were plated in 48-well plates on the day before neutralization assay. sera and balfs were heat-inactivated at 56˚c for 30 min. mers-cov spike pseudovirus was pre-incubated with serially diluted sera or balfs for 1 h at 37˚c, and the mixture was added to huh 7.5 cells. after overnight incubation, cells were changed with fresh 10% dmem and cultured for another 48 h. subsequently, the cells were harvested with trypsin-edta and analyzed using facscalibur flow cytometer (bd biosciences, san diego, ca). mers-cov pseudovirus transduction was measured as % transduction.nhne cells were infected with virus solution (mers-cov 10 μl/pbs 10 ml) (korea centers for disease control and prevention, korea) for 1 day and total rna was isolated using trizol (life technology, seoul, korea). cdna was synthesized from 3 μg of rna with random hexamer primers and moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (perkin elmer life sciences, waltham, ma, usa and roche applied science, indianapolis, in, usa). amplification was performed using the taqman universal pcr master mix (pe biosystems, foster city, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer's protocol. briefly, amplification reactions had a total volume of 12 μl and contained 2 μl of cdna (reverse transcription mixture), oligonucleotide primers (final concentration of 800 nm), and taqman hybridization probe (200 nm). real-time pcr probes were labeled at the 5' end with carboxyfluorescein (fam) and at the 3' end with the quencher carboxytetramethylrhodamine (tamra). to quantify the cellular viral level and host gene expression, cellular rna was used to generate cdna. the mers-cov mrna level was monitored using a quantitative pcr for the n2 gene of mers. primers for n2 gene of mers-cov was purchased from applied biosystems (foster city, ca, usa). realtime pcr was performed using the pe biosystems abi prism 7700 sequence detection system. thermocyling parameters were as follows: 50˚c for 2 min, 95˚c for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of 95˚c for 15 s and 60˚c for 1 min. all pcr assays were quantitative and utilized plasmids containing the target gene sequences as standards. all reactions were performed in triplicate, and all real-time pcr data were normalized to the level of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh, 1×10 6 copies) to correct for variations between samples.using a syringe, the lungs were perfused with 5 ml pbs containing 10 u/ml heparin (sigma, st. louis, mo) via the right ventricle. to obtain single-cell suspensions, the tissues were homogenized and passed through 70-μm cell strainers (spl, kyonggi-do, korea). for mhc class i tetramer analysis, lymphocytes were washed with facs buffer (0.5% fbs and 0.1% nan3 in pbs) and were blocked with purified rat anti-mouse cd16/cd32 (bd pharmingen, san diego, ca) and 5 μg/ml streptavidin (invitrogen). then, cells were stained with anti-cd8a [53-6.7], anti-cd44 [im7] (biolegend, san diego, ca), and k d /s291 (kyysiiphsi) tetramer for 30 min at 4˚c under dark conditions. after staining, the cells were fixed with facs lysing solution (bd biosciences). to evaluate cytokine-producing cells, intracellular staining was performed. lung lymphocytes were resuspended in iscove's modified dulbecco's medium (imdm; welgene) supplemented with 10% fbs and stimulated with 10 μm mers s291 peptide (kyysiiphsi) or 10 μg/ml mers s1 protein (aa 1-725; sino biological inc.) in the presence of brefeldin a (ebioscience, san diego, ca) and recombinant human il-2 (bio-legend) for 5 h at 37˚c. after stimulation, these cells were initially stained with anti-cd8a lymphocytes were isolated from lung and spleen as described previously [41] . subsequently, cells were stained with anti-cd8 [53-6.7], anti-cd69 [h1.2f3], anti-cd103 [2e7] (biolegend), and k d /s291 tetramer. to identify dead cells, the cells were not fixed and subsequently stained with dapi (biolegend) for 15 min at rt before analysis on a flow cytometer. data on all the stained cells were acquired using bd lsr fortessa (bd biosciences), which were analyzed using flowjo software (treestar inc., ashland, or).all data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (sem; n = 4). statistical differences between two means were analyzed using two-tailed student's t test. for comparisons of multiple groups, one-way analysis of variance (anova) or two-way anova along with a bonferroni post-test were used as appropriate. statistical significance was considered when p values were <0.05.we designed and generated three recombinant adenoviruses as vaccine candidates containing codon-optimized full-length spike, rbd, or ntd region of the spike. the coding sequences of full-length spike (1-1353), rbd (367-606), and ntd (18-353) were cloned into the shuttle vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter and subsequently inserted into the adenovirus genome via homologous recombination. the construction schemes of the recombinant replication-defective adenoviruses (designated rad/spike, rad/rbd, and rad/ ntd) were shown in fig 1a. to confirm transgene expression, hek293 cells were infected with rad/spike, rad/rbd, or rad/ntd and western blotting was performed. western blot performed using mers-cov s1-specific antibody revealed two prominent bands at~200 kda and~120 kda for the culture supernatant and lysate of rad/spike-infected cells (fig 1b) . we considered the protein species with a higher molecular weight of 200 kda to be the glycosylated s1/s2 spike protein and the species with a lower molecular weight of~120 kda to be the s1 subunit of the spike protein cleaved by host cell protease [19, 33, 36, 42, 43] . the rbd domain was detected as a single band with a molecular weight of 35-40 kda in the lysate and culture supernatant of rad/rbd-infected cells (fig 1c) . the molecular weight of rbd increased slightly in the culture supernatant, which might be due to the different patterns of glycosylation between the culture supernatant and the lysate [44] . the single band of~50 kda was observed only in the culture supernatant of rad/ntd-infected hek293 cells by in-house rad/ spike-immunized mouse serum (fig 1d) .to compare the immunogenicity of our recombinant adenoviral vaccine candidates, balb/c mice were immunized twice on day 0 and day 14 with rad/ntd, rad/rbd, rad/spike, or control adenovirus (rad/mock) via in route. mice were sacrificed at 7 days after boost immunization to analyze both humoral and cellular immune responses. all candidate vaccines induced significant s1-specific systemic igg responses in sera as opposed to the negative control rad/mock vaccine (fig 2a) . notably, the rad/spike-immunized group induced the highest s1-specific serum igg responses among the three groups.mucosal iga in the respiratory tract plays critical roles in host defense against respiratory virus infections [45] . thus, we measured the spike-specific mucosal iga antibody responses in balfs. s1-specific iga was detected in all vaccination groups but not in the control group ( fig  2b) . among the three vaccination groups, the rad/spike group elicited the highest levels of s1-specific iga response, and the rad/ntd group showed a higher titer than that shown by the rad/rbd group.next, to examine the ability of our candidate vaccines to induce cellular immune responses, mice were sacrificed at 7 days after boost injection, which is the peak of cd8 t-cell responses, and their lung cells were harvested. lung lymphocytes were stained with k d /s291 tetramer to quantify spike-specific cd8 t cells. previous studies have reported that cd8 t-cell responses to the mers-cov spike protein were dominantly directed toward s291 (kyysiiphsi) epitope [46] . other studies also screened epitopes in the rbd region to measure antigen-specific cd8 t-cell responses, but the frequency of ifn-γ-producing cd8 t cells responding to other peptides seems to be either undetectable or very low [46, 47] . therefore, we employed the s291 immunodominant epitope to evaluate the spike-specific cd8 t-cell responses. significant percentages of k d /s291 tetramer-positive cd8 t cells were detected in the lungs of rad/ntd-or rad/spike-immune mice but not in the lungs of the mice in the rad/mock or rad/rbd group (fig 2c and 2d) . s291-specific cd8 t cells were not observed in rad/rbd-immunized mice, because rbd (aa residues from 367 to 606) does not contain the s291 epitope. to assess the levels of effector cd8 and cd4 t cells secreting ifn-γ, lung lymphocytes were stimulated with s291 peptide or mers s1 protein, respectively. ifn-γ-producing cd8 t cells were also increased significantly in the rad/spike and rad/ntd groups, and ifn-γ-producing cd4 t cells were increased significantly in the rad/spike group (s1 fig). subsequently, neutralizing activities of the immune sera and balfs were evaluated using mers-cov spike pseudotyped particles. among the candidate vaccine groups, the rad/ spike-immune mice exhibited the highest levels of neutralizing antibody in both sera and balfs, followed by mice in the rad/ntd group (fig 3a-3c) . however, rad/rbd group exhibited no significant difference in neutralizing activity compared with the rad/mock control group. to further confirm the neutralizing activity of the rad/spike-induced antibody in an authentic mers-cov infection of human primary respiratory cells, mers-cov were preincubated with the immune sera from rad/spike and rad/mock group before infection of nhne cells. subsequently the viral replication levels were measured by quantitative rt-pcr. as shown in fig 3d, pre-treatment of rad/spike-immune sera significantly inhibited mers-cov replication while rad/mock sera did not. taken together, these results demonstrate that immunization with rad/spike is the most efficient for eliciting both neutralizing antibody responses in serum and balf and t-cell responses.recent studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies could also be directed against non-rbds, such as ntd, besides rbd [26, 48] . our results also indicate that ntd can elicit neutralizing antibody responses after immunization. therefore, we further investigated the regional specificity of neutralizing activities induced by immunization with rad vaccines. first, serum igg responses were analyzed by elisa using ntd, rbd, or s2 protein as coating antigens. the rntd protein was prepared and purified using a baculovirus expression system (s2 fig). both rad/ntd and rad/spike groups exhibited significantly higher levels of ntdspecific serum igg than the control group, and there was no significant difference in ntdspecific serum igg levels between the rad/ntd and rad/spike groups (fig 4a) . both the rad/ rbd and rad/spike groups exhibited significantly higher levels of rbd-specific serum igg than the negative control group (fig 4b) . as expected, only rad/spike group showed significantly higher s2-specific serum igg responses than the control group (fig 4c) .to investigate the target domains mainly involved in neutralization, we compared changes in the neutralizing activity of sera collected from rad/spike group using protein competitors. sera diluted at 1:640 were pre-incubated with 10 μg of ntd, rbd, s1, or s2 protein at 37˚c for 1 h; neutralization assay was subsequently performed as shown in fig 3. as shown in fig  4d, neutralization activity of immune sera was significantly reduced by pre-incubation with ntd, rbd, and s1 protein competitors. especially, competition with the s1 protein inhibited neutralizing activity by~60%, while ntd and rbd competitors inhibited neutralization activity by~8% and~6%, respectively. in contrast, soluble s2 protein competitor did not have any effect on neutralization activity. these results demonstrate that rad/spike can induce neutralizing antibody responses targeting various regions of s1 including ntd and rbd. this also suggests that employing rad/spike might be better vaccination strategy in eliciting broader spectrum of neutralizing antibody responses.previously, we showed that among all vaccine candidates, rad/spike possesses the strongest immunogenicity for inducing humoral and cellular immune responses. then, we investigated the best route for immunization by injecting mice with rad/spike via in, im, or sl route. sera were collected 2 weeks after each immunization and measured for specific igg by elisa. significant spikespecific igg levels were detected regardless of the immunization route ( fig 5a) . notably, in immunization induced the highest igg antibody responses among the groups. after the boost immunization, significant spike-specific iga levels were detected in balfs of mice from in and sl groups, but not in those from the im group (fig 5b) , and the response was also highest in the in group.to investigate whether the immunization route affects neutralizing antibody responses, the neutralizing activity of sera and balfs collected from each group was analyzed using the pseudotyped virus. all immunization routes generated significant serum-neutralizing antibody levels as opposed to the rad/mock control group (fig 6a and 6b) . however, no neutralization activity was observed in balf of mice immunized via im route; this finding was consistent with mucosal iga response shown in fig 6. ic 50 neutralization titer did not show statistically significant differences between in and sl immunization. taken together, these results indicate that mucosal immunization of rad/spike vaccine can induce both systemic and mucosal neutralizing antibodies, while im immunization could only elicit systemic responses. [49] [50] [51] . to investigate the influence of immunization route in the establishment of lung t rm cells, balb/c mice were administered in or im vaccine containing rad/spike at a concentration of 1×10 8 pfus. at a memory time point (day 30), mice were intravenously injected with anti-cd45-apc antibody and sacrificed after 5 min to discriminate circulating cells from lunglocalized cells [52] . as shown in s3 fig, cells stained with anti-cd45 ab were identified as circulating t cells in blood, and cells protected from in vivo labeling were confined to the lung parenchyma. at this time point, mice immunized via in route had significantly higher frequencies and numbers of k d /s291 tetramer-positive cd8 t cells in the airway and lung parenchyma compared with im-immunized mice (fig 7a and 7b ). in contrast, there were no significant differences in the numbers of k d /s291 tetramer-positive cd8 t cells in the lung vasculature and spleen between in and im immunization groups.we subsequently assessed the co-expression of cd103 and cd69 as the canonical makers of lung t rm [53] . a majority of k d /s291 tetramer-positive cd8 t cells in the airway and lung parenchyma in in-immunized mice were cd69 + or cd69 + cd103 + , and their frequencies were significantly higher than im-immunized mice (fig 7c and 7d) . taken together, these results show that in immunization is more efficient in establishing antigen-specific cd8 t rm cells in the airway and lung parenchyma than im immunization.the persistence and maintenance of immune responses following vaccination is important for vaccine efficacy [54] . thus, we assessed whether rad/spike immunization could induce long- term antibody responses. balb/c mice were inoculated three times (weeks 0, 3, and 11) with 1×10 7 pfus of rad/spike via in route, and sera were collected at 2, 6, 15, and 30 weeks; the specific antibody responses were subsequently measured by elisa (fig 8a) . spike-specific serum igg and mucosal iga titers gradually increased with each immunization and maintained until 30 weeks with no obvious decline (fig 8b and 8c) .to evaluate neutralizing activities, the assay was performed using sera collected at 15 and 30 weeks as well as balfs obtained at 30 weeks. in agreement with igg responses, serum neutralizing activities at 30 weeks were similar to those at 15 weeks (fig 8d) . the absolute titer of neutralization in balf at 30 weeks was lower than that at an earlier time point shown in fig 3 , but remained at a significant level in comparison with the control (fig 8e) . overall, the results demonstrate that in immunization with rad/spike could induce long-lasting neutralizing antibodies, which might be beneficial for protection against mers-cov infection.since the emergence and spread of mers, the development of safe and effective vaccines against mers-cov is urgently required [7, 55] . mers-cov spike protein is the main mediator of virus entry into the target cells [17, 23] . therefore, spike protein is one of key targets for the development of vaccines and therapeutics [23] . several vaccine candidates targeting rbd of the spike protein have been investigated [22, 25, 28, 29, 32, 56] . however, it seems that the efficacy of the rbd-based vaccine candidates are limited by the confined breadth of antibody responses and subsequent emergence of escape mutants [27, 38, 57] . indeed, it has been shown that several mutations in the rbd region can result in the generation of neutralization escape variants [38, [58] [59] [60] . several studies have reported that other regions of spike protein rather than rbd can also be targets of neutralizing antibodies [26, 27, 48, 61] .in this study, we constructed adenovirus-based vaccine candidates that express ntd, rbd, and full-length spike and compared immunogenicity and neutralizing activity induced by these candidates. our results clearly showed that the rad/spike vaccine expressing full-length spike protein is the best candidate in terms of immunogenicity and neutralizing efficacy. it is likely that neutralizing epitopes of the spike protein were located on non-rbd of the s1 subunit as well as rbd, based on the results of protein competitor experiments (fig 4) . the use of full-length spike as an immunogen in rad/spike vaccine might increase the breadth of the antibody responses which will help to reduce the risk of escape mutations [27, 57, 62] . however, it is not yet clear whether s2 region also contributes for inducing neutralizing antibodies by rad/spike vaccination. s2 subunit protein as a competitor did not reduce the neutralizing activities of the immune sera in the protein competitor experiments (fig 4) , and this might be due to the inappropriate conformation of s2 subunit [27, 63] . further studies are needed to determine whether the s2 subunit also contributes for eliciting neutralizing antibodies. it is noteworthy that the rad/spike vaccine induced systemic igg, mucosal iga, and t-cell responses together upon in immunization. in addition to neutralizing antibodies, virus-specific cd8 t cells also play an important role in mers-cov clearance [46] . indeed, several studies suggest that both virus-neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic cd8 t cell responses are necessary for complete protection against mers-cov infection [29, 33, 35] . therefore, the rad/spike vaccine expressing the full-length spike protein rather than the rbd or ntd alone might be most potent one among our vaccine candidates.our results also demonstrate that in immunization induces superior responses compared to im and sl immunization, in terms of neutralizing efficacy. mers-cov infection occurs through respiratory tracts in humans [3, 64] . accordingly, vaccination routes capable of inducing local mucosal immunity such as secretory iga would be more potent in preventing mers-cov infection. in addition, in immunization with rad/spike vaccine induced significantly higher numbers of specific t rm cells in the airway and lung parenchyma compared with im-immunized mice (fig 6) . it is likely that lung-resident t rm cells mediate effective protective immunity against respiratory infections [53, 65] . thus, in immunization of rad/spike eliciting systemic igg, secretory iga, and t rm responses together might be the most promising regimen compared to other immunization routes, and provide superior protection.in summary, we generated several recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine candidates against mers-cov and compared systemic and local humoral responses and cellular responses via different immunization routes. we found that single in immunization of rad/ spike successfully induces systemic igg, secretory iga, and lung t rm responses and provides long-lasting neutralizing immunity. therefore, our recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine onset of symptoms or may be transmitted by people without symptoms. rapid development of a protective vaccine against covid-19 is therefore of paramount importance. here we demonstrate that recombinantly expressed receptor binding domain (rbd) of the spike protein homologous to sars binds to ace2, the viral receptor. higly repetitive display of rbd on immunologically optimized virus-like particles derived from cucumber mosaic virus resulted in a vaccine candidate (rbd-cumvtt) that induced high levels of specific antibodies in mice which were able to block binding of spike protein to ace2 and potently neutralized the sars-cov-2 virus in vitro.covid-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus closely related to viruses causing sars and mers. as the disease caused by the other two viruses, covid-19 mainly manifests symptoms in the lung and causes cough and fever 1 . the disease covid-19 is less severe than sars and mers, which is beneficial per se but leads to easier and wider spread of the virus, in particular due to infected individuals with very little symptoms ("spreaders") and a long incubation time (up to 3 weeks) combined with viral shedding long before disease onset 2 .a vaccine with rapid onset of protection is therefore in high demand for the control of the pandemic that is currently taking its course.the spike protein of covid-19 is highly homologous to the spike protein of sars and both viruses share the same receptor, which is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) 3, 4 . the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the sars spike protein binds to ace2 and is an important target for neutralizing antibodies [5] [6] [7] . by analogy, the rbd of covid-19 spike protein may be expected to similarly be the target of neutralizing antibodies, blocking the interaction of the virus with its receptor. we have previously shown that antigens displayed on virus-like particles (vlp) induce high levels of antibodies in all species tested, including humans 8 .more recently, we have developed an immunologically optimized vlp platform based on cucumber mosaic virus. these cumvtt vlps (hereafter cumvtt) incorporate a universal t cell epitope derived from tetanus toxin providing pre-existing t cell help. in addition, during the production process these vlps package bacterial rna which is a ligand for toll-like receptor 7/8 and serves as potent adjuvants 9 . using antigens displayed on these vlps, it 4 was possible to induce high levels of specific antibodies in mice, rats, cats, dogs and horses and treat diseases such as atopic dermatitis in dogs or insect bite hypersensitivity in horses [9] [10] [11] . to generate a covid-19 vaccine candidate, we therefore attempted to display the rbd domain on cumvtt (fig. 1a) . to this end we gene-synthesized the covid-19 rbd domain and fused it to an fc molecule for better expression. as expected, the protein bound efficiently to the viral receptor ace2 as determined by sandwich elisa (fig. 1b) . in a next step, the protein was chemically coupled to the surface of cumvtt using the well established chemical cross-linkers sata and smph (ref. 9). sds-page and western blotting confirmed efficient coupling of the rbd-fusion molecule to cumvtt, resulting in the vaccine candidate rbd-cumvtt (fig. 1c,d) .to test immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, mice were immunized three times (weekly schedule) with the rbd-fusion molecule alone or conjugated to the surface of cumvtt formulated in montanide adjuvants. as shown in fig. 2a -c, coupling to vlps dramatically increased the immunogenicity of the rbd. as shown by elisa on recombinant rbd, rbd-cumvtt showed strongly increased immunogenicity at all time-points tested (one week after the vaccine injection time-points). to assess the potential for anti-viral activity, we assessed whether the induced antibodies were able to block binding of the rbd protein to the viral receptor ace2. as shown in fig. 3 , immune sera obtained after two boosts (day 21) were able to strongly inhibit rbd binding to ace2.the best correlate of protection is viral neutralization. to this end, we generated pseudotyped retroviruses 12 expressing the sars-cov-2 spike protein and luciferase for quantification of infection (fig. 4a ). using these viruses, the neutralizing capacity of the sera from immunized mice was assessed on ace2-transfected cells (fig. 4b) , directly demonstrating high anti-viral neutralizing activity of the induced antibodies. hence, the rbd-cumvtt vaccine candidate is able to induce high levels of sars-cov-2 neutralizing antibodies. furthermore, the cumvtt based vaccine is based on highly efficient expression systems and chemical conjugation technologies, rendering it an attractive candidate for large scale production under cgmp. previous studies with a similar vlp-based conjugate vaccine has demonstrated that high levels of specific antibodies can be mounted within a week 13, 14 (see also fig. 2a) , offering the additional possibilities to rapidly immunize individuals that have been exposed to infected humans or those that are kept in quarantine. thus, vaccines based on the sars-cov-2 rbd domain displayed on vlps may have the potential to critically interfere with global spread of the virus. 5 the sars-cov-2 receptor-binding domain (rbd) and the n-terminal peptidase domain of human ace2 were expressed using 293f cells (invitrogen). the sars-cov-2 rbd (residues arg319-phe541) with an n-terminal il-2 signal peptide for secretion and a cterminal fc tag for purification was inserted into pfuse-migg1-fc2 vector (invitrogen). the construct was transformed into bacterial dh5α competent cells, and the extracted plasmid was then transfected into 293f cells at a density of 3×10 6 cells/ml using pei (invitrogen). the cell culture supernatant containing the secreted rbd was harvested 96 h after infection, concentrated and buffer-exchanged to hbs (10 mm hepes, ph 7.2, 150 mm nacl). rbd was captured by protein a resin (ge healthcare) and eluted with gly-hcl buffer ph 2.2.fractions containing rbd were collected and neutralized to ph 7.0 with 1m tris. for elisa coating, ace2 was cleaved from the fc part using thrombin as described in the manufacturer's manual.the human ace2 (residues ser19-ser741) with an n-terminal il-2 signal peptide for secretion and a c-terminal 6×his tag for purification was inserted into pfuse-vector (invitrogen). the human ace2 was expressed by essentially the same protocol used for the sars-cov-2 rbd. ace2 was captured by ni-nta resin (ge healthcare) and eluted with 500 mm imidazole in hbs buffer. rbd was then purified by gel filtration chromatography using the superdex 200 column (ge healthcare) pre-equilibrated with hbs buffer. fractions containing ace2 were collected.the antibody competitive binding activities of the serum were assayed by elisa. ace2 (1ug/ml) was incubated in 96-well plate overnight at 4°c. after incubation, the plate was blocked with 2% bsa for 2h at 37°c and then washed five times with pbs containing 0.05% tween 20. bsa was used as negative control followed by the addition of a mixture of 40-fold diluted serum and rbd-mfc (0.15ug/ml) followed by incubation for 30 min with gentle shaking at 37°c. plates were washed five times with pbs containing 0.05% tween 20 (pbt) followed by 100 µl of horseradish peroxidase/anti-mfc antibody conjugate (diluted 1:5000 in pbt buffer), incubated 30 min with gentle shaking. plates were washed five times pbt buffer and developed with 100 µl of freshly prepared 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) substrate. reaction was stopped with 100 µl of 1.0 m h3po4 and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm in a microtiter plate reader. 6 the production of cumvtt was described in detail in zeltins et al. 9 briefly, e coli c2566 cells the rbd was conjugated to cumvtt using the cross-linker succinimidyl 6-(betamaleimidopropionamido) hexanoate (smph) (thermo fisher scientific, 10-molar excess, 60 minutes, 23°c). the coupling reactions were performed with 0.3x molar excess of rbd, 0.3x rbd, or equal molar amount of rbd regarding the cumvtt (shaking at 23°c for 3 hours at 1200 rpm on dsg titertek; flow laboratories, irvine, united kingdom). unreacted smph and rbd proteins were removed using amicon-ultra 0.5, 100k (merck-millipore, burlington, mass). vlp samples were centrifuged for 2 minutes at 14,000 rpm for measurement on nd-1000. coupling efficiency was calculated by densitometry (as previously described for il17a-cumvtt vaccine 9 ), with a result of approximately 20% to 30%. pseudovirus expressing the sars-cov-2 spike protein was produced by lentivirus second- the 293t-ace2 cells which stably express ace2 receptors on the cell membrane were prepared by transfection of ace2 gene into 293t cells using lentivirus system.pseudoviruses prepared above were added to the 293t-ace2 cells (3 × 10 4 cells/well) with 100 μl polybrene (16μg/ml). after 48 h, the infection was monitored using the luciferase assay system (promega). titer was calculated based on serial dilutions of pseudovirus.the mouse serum samples (2 μl) were diluted to 1:10, 1:40, 1:160, 1:640 and 1:2560 respectively, and then mixed with an equal volume of pseudovirus stock. after incubation at 37°c for 1 h, the mixture was inoculated on the 293t-ace2 cells (3 x 10 4 cells/well). at the same time, pseudovirus+dmem medium was set as a positive control and dmem medium only was set as a negative control. after the cells were incubated for 72 hours, serum neutralization was measured by luciferase activity of infected pseudovirus. a cut-off of >80% was used as to determine neutralizing titer. viral respiratory infections such as influenza and measles, which can cause severe acute respiratory symptoms, have been responsible for many epidemics. in the spring of 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infection (sari) spread globally. 1, 2, 3 the world health organization (who) coined the acronym sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) for this sari and subsequently named the causative coronavirus sars-cov. in the summer of 2012, another sari broke out in saudi arabia, which was found to be caused by a new coronavirus. the who named this respiratory disease middle east respiratory syndrome also known by the acronym mers and called the causative coronavirus mers-cov. in the winter of 2019, another sari outbreak occurred in wuhan, china, which very quickly spread around the world. the culprit was identified as another novel coronavirus, which the who named as sars-cov-2 due to similarities to sars-cov, and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 . sars-cov-2 is a newly emergent coronavirus closely related to sars and mers. 4 covid-19 is a respiratory tract infection that causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but can also lead to issn: 1740-4398 review -coronavirus disease 2019 : latest developments in potential treatments drugsincontext.com mortality and morbidity. current reports suggest that covid-19 causes milder symptoms in children, including fever and cough, but co-infection has also been observed. 4, 5 however, covid-19 is associated with severe outcomes in the older population, immunocompromised patients, and those with chronic cardiovascular or respiratory conditions. 4 at present, no pharmaceutical products have been shown to be reliable, safe, and effective for treating covid-19. 6 in the midst of the current global pandemic, many research groups around the world are actively developing treatments against this disease to reduce morbidities and mortalities. in the long term, the goal is to develop a vaccine to prevent further infections and future outbreaks. however, an effective vaccine may take years to develop and to manufacture on a global scale. furthermore, it is unknown if newborns and patients already recovered from covid-19 will need to be vaccinated. it is also uncertain if such a vaccine can protect individuals from this novel coronavirus in the future. in this narrative review, we summarise the latest body of evidence and ongoing research on the development of pharmacological therapies for covid-19. the aim is also to review the suggested pathophysiology, prophylactic treatments, and therapeutic modalities for covid-19.articles were retrieved using pubmed clinical queries with the search term 'coronavirus covid-19' regardless of the date of publication. there were 88 articles under clinical study categories (category: therapy; scope: broad) and 11 systematic reviews. the discussion is based on, but not limited to, these search results.severe acute respiratory syndrome is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by sars-cov. the sars outbreak between november 2002 and july 2003 resulted in 8098 cases and 774 deaths in 29 countries around the world, giving a casefatality rate of 9.6%. 7, 8 treatments for sars during the outbreak were mainly supportive, as there were no known effective antiviral agents. the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections was the main treatment regimen. 9 ribavirin, a broad-spectrum purine nucleoside analogue, was empirically used as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. 10 human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir were also used, as it was found to have weak in vitro antiviral activity on the prototype sars-cov. 10, 11 other therapies included immunomodulators (e.g. corticosteroid, convalescent plasma, and pentaglobulin), interferons, and traditional chinese medicine (tcm). 9, 12 the development of vaccines was underway by the end of the epidemic, but no effective vaccine has since emerged.middle east respiratory syndrome caused by mers-cov may have been transmitted to humans through infected camels. the mers outbreak between september 2012 and january 2020 was reported to have caused 2519 laboratory-confirmed cases and 858 associated deaths globally, giving a case-fatality rate of 34.4%. 13 as of 2019, there is still no effective vaccine or treatment for this disease, although a number of antiviral medications have been investigated. 14 a 2019 systematic review of therapeutic agents against mers-cov showed that there is still no general consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for mers-cov infection. 15 the miracle trial (mers-cov infection treated with a combination of lopinavir/ ritonavir and interferon-β1b) was the first randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-β1b in hospitalised patients with mers. 16, 17 the trial was started in july 2016 and enrolled 194 participants, although results have yet to be published. 16 sars-cov, mers, and sars-cov-2 are all zoonotic β-coronaviruses that have crossed from animals to humans. 23 the origin of sars-cov is still a mystery and remains a controversial topic. sars-cov is closely related to civet and bat covs, but it is phylogenetically divergent from other coronaviruses associated with human infections, including issn: 1740-4398 review -coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19): latest developments in potential treatments drugsincontext.com oc43, nl63, 229e, and hku1. 9 the full-length genome sequence of sars-cov-2 shows that it is similar to sars-cov, sharing 79.6% sequence identity. 24 both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov use the same cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme ii (ace2) receptor, to enter into host cells. 24 the pathophysiology of covid-19 has yet to be confirmed, but it is likely to involve inflammatory processes that can trigger a massive cytokine storm. the cytokine profile of critically ill patients revealed increased levels of interleukin (il)-2, il-7, il-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, and tumour necrosis factor-α. 25 histopathological examination of the lungs of patients with covid-19 revealed immunopathological changes including diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes, pulmonary oedema, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates. 26 according to the limited number of reports of biopsy/autopsy results of patients with covid-19, the pathological features resemble those seen in sars and mers virus infections. [26] [27] [28] the similarities between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 suggest that the development of potential prophylactics and therapeutics for covid-19 could be based on research on sars. 3,12,19,29-,32 an important strategy would be to possibly control the viral replication using an effective antiviral agent to minimise the subsequent inflammation and tissue damage due to high viral loads. immunomodulators could play a rescue therapy role, as pathological findings suggest that there is immunopathological damage. 9, 26 although the sars-cov-2 s protein receptor-binding domain has higher affinity than the sars-cov s protein receptor-binding domain, development of vaccines against sars-cov-2 could still be based on research on sars-cov. [33] [34] [35] therapeutics for covid-19the majority of covid-19 patients, especially children, are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, and will likely recover by managing their own symptoms without the need for hospitalisation. 36 38 the who has also launched the 'solidarity' international clinical trial, which is investigating effective treatments and is currently comparing four of the most promising treatment options: remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, lopinavir-ritonavir plus interferon β-1a, and hydroxychloroquine. 39 over 90 countries have joined the 'solidarity' international clinical trial. 39 in the following discussion, we summarise the latest evidence and research progress from the literature, with focus on pharmacological therapies (table 1) .empirical antimicrobials should be started within 1 hour after the detection of sepsis based on clinical diagnosis and local epidemiology. 4 for critically ill covid-19 patients, intensive care treatment can include oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 40 in addition to the standard management for acute respiratory distress syndrome, the literature also suggests lower intubation threshold, early prone positioning, and cautious fluid status management, considering that the incidence of myocardial dysfunction in covid-19 patients is high. 41 further discussion on the intensive care management of covid-19 patients is beyond the scope of this review.remdesivir remdesivir (gs-5734) is a nucleoside analogue prodrug that inhibits viral rna polymerases, and was developed by gilead science in response to the ebola outbreak in 2017. [42] [43] [44] it is considered to be one of the most promising broad-spectrum antivirals for treating covid-19. in vitro antiviral activities of remdesivir have been demonstrated in sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2. 45, 46 in early april, a preliminary report describing the clinical outcomes of a cohort of 53 hospitalised covid-19 patients who received remdesivir, 68% of patients showed improvement of their oxygen-support status, but 60% of patients reported adverse events during follow-up. 42 subsequently, a double-blinded randomised controlled trial in 237 adult patients with severe covid-19 showed that remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits whilst adverse events were reported in 66% of patients. 47 separately, the results of an interim analysis of the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial involving 1063 patients are more encouraging, as it indicated that patients who received redmesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (median time to recovery was 11 versus 15 days). 48 more recently, a phase 3 simple clinical trial demonstrated that patients receiving a 5-day and 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvements in clinical status. 49 reported in the preliminary studies included elevated hepatic enzymes, diarrhoea, constipation, hypoalbuminaemia, rash, renal impairment, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypotension. 42, 47 potential drug-drug interactions with other medications metabolised through the cytochrome p450 system were also reported. the safety profile of this drug needs to be further evaluated. randomised controlled trials on remdesivir are still ongoing, and two studies are in phase iii of clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir. [50] [51] [52] [53] lopinavir-ritonavir lopinavir-ritonavir is a combination therapy used to treat hiv. ritonavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 and is used to increase the plasma half-life of lopinavir. 54 lopinavir is a protease inhibitor that has been demonstrated to have antiviral effects against sars, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2 in vitro. 54, 55 several trials have been investigating the efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir compared with other drugs as a treatment for covid-19. 39,56-58 nevertheless, the results so far indicate that lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has little benefit as a standalone therapy against sars-cov-2 infection. in a clinical trial involving 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection, lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was not associated with any clinical improvements compared with standard care. 54 furthermore, lopinavir-ritonavir treatment caused gastrointestinal adverse events, and nearly 14% of the recipients could not complete the full 14-day course of treatment. 54 other adverse effects included gastrointestinal intolerance, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and qt prolongation. the use of ritonavir can cause severe drug-drug interactions in medications metabolised through the cytochrome system. the tolerance of the side effects might limit the dosage needed, as the concentration necessary to inhibit viral replication is relatively high. 54 other clinical trials have been testing lopinavir-ritonavir combined with different drugs and different combinations such as ritonavir and interferon 1b. 39, 56 early use of lopinavir-ritonavir as an additional treatment to ritonavir-methylprednisolone for sars-cov was associated with a reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate when compared with a matched cohort. 59 a clinical phase ii trial has been investigating the use of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with interferon β-1b as a treatment for mers since 2016, but the trial is ongoing and results have yet to be published. 60 ribavirin ribavirin is a guanosine analogue that interferes with the replication of rna and dna viruses. 61 in vitro antiviral activities of ribavirin have been demonstrated in sars-cov and mers-cov. 61, 62 from the experiences of sars-cov, the use of ribavirin as a monotherapy was limited as it required high concentration to inhibit viral replication, and ribavirin usage was associated with dose-dependent haemolysis and liver toxicity. 63, 64 in the treatment of sars and mers, ribavirin is used in combination with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir. 11, 65 the use of ribavirin in combination with interferon or lopinavir/ ritonavir is recommended in the latest chinese national treatment guidelines for covid-19. 66 a recent multicentre randomised phase 2 trial showed triple antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon β-1b was superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms, shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild-to-moderate covid- 19. 67 chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are widely used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases. these drugs have an established safety profile and are readily available at relatively low cost. hydroxychloroquine sulphate has been demonstrated to be less toxic than chloroquine phosphate in animal studies. 68 both these drugs have been reported to have antiviral effects against sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in vitro. their potential mechanisms of action include blocking viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors, reducing viral replication, and blocking the export of newly constructed virions. 45, 69 a trial in china involving more than 100 patients with covid-19 showed that chloroquine was better able to inhibit exacerbation of pneumonia and improve lung imaging findings compared to the control treatment. 70 a recent small open-label nonrandomised clinical trial showed patients given daily hydroxychloroquine had significantly reduced viral load measured by nasopharyngeal swab on day 6. 5 however, the results in this study may have been confounded by other factors, as some patients also received azithromycin. 71 the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should be used with caution in patients at risk for qt prolongation. the use of chloroquine alone is also a risk factor for qt prolongation. a phase iib clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of high-dose chloroquine was terminated early due to prolonged qtc (>500 ms) and high lethality in the high-dose group compared to the lowdose group. 72 a recent analysis of a multinational registry of 96,032 hospitalised covid-19 patients revealed that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine was associated with decreased in-hospital survival (mortality of 11.1 versus 9.3%) and increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmia. 73 however, concerns have been raised about the veracity of data and analyses in this study and has led to retraction of the article. 74 other adverse effects of chloroquine include retinopathy, rash, nausea, glucose fluctuation and diarrhoea, and use of chloroquine is contraindicated in patients with porphyria. chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should not be used to treat covid-19 until they have been tested in clinical trials to determine the optimal dosage to balance efficacy and safety. chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as candidate prophylactics for covid-19 in populations at high risk of covid-19 infections, such as italy and new york. 75 other antiviral treatments other antiviral treatments for covid-19 currently undergoing clinical trials include protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, camostat mesilate, ritonavir, danoprevir, darunavir, flavopiridol, relacatib), nucleoside analogues (galidesivir), fusion inhibitors (umifenovir), rna polymerase inhibitors (favipiravir), and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir). 76corticosteroids corticosteroid therapies such as intravenous methylprednisolone are currently being tested as a treatment for covid-19. 77 methylprednisolone has already been used in covid-19 patients in combination with antibiotics, oseltamivir, and oxygen therapy. 25 long and colleagues reported that corticosteroid therapy using methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone was beneficial in treating issn: 1740-4398 review -coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19): latest developments in potential treatments drugsincontext.com sars-cov patients, 78 and significantly prolonged survival time in clinical cases. 78 however, other studies reported the use of corticosteroids in early stages of sars infection increased the viral load. 79 furthermore, studies on the use of corticosteroids as an adjuvant therapy against mers-cov infection were unable to prove efficacy because all patients died. 80 based on the recommendation by frontline chinese physicians and local clinical experience during the sars epidemic, a short course of corticosteroids at a low-to-moderate dose is probably justifiable for critically ill patients. 66, 81 corticosteroids are effective in treating the autoinflammatory cytokine activation syndrome.reported side effects such as osteonecrosis are concerning, but data are still conflicting and recent recommendations against the use of corticosteroids are based on circumstantial evidence. routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended as corticosteroids may prolong or worsen the disease, and were found to prolong viral shedding in mers and sars. based on the current body of evidence, corticosteroids may be justified for certain medical indications (i.e. acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis) at the discretion of the physician in charge.convalescent plasma might be promising as a postexposure prophylaxis for covid-19 and as a potential treatment after infection, as it was also used as a salvage therapy in the sars and mers epidemics. [82] [83] [84] considering the huge number of people exposed to covid-19, use of convalescent plasma for post-exposure prophylaxis may not be justifiable, but could still be a treatment option. an observational study during the sars epidemic showed a lower mortality rate in those receiving convalescent plasma as a treatment for sars. 82 studies on the clinical effects and outcomes of critically ill covid-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma have so far shown encouraging results, although it should be noted that these studies were based on small case series. 85, 86 furthermore, studies on the use of convalescent plasma in sars patients did not report any significant side effects. 82, 87 randomised trials on convalescent plasma therapy are still needed to eliminate the effects of other treatments and to investigate the safety and efficacy and optimal timing of administration. highly purified preparations of neutralising antibodies against sars-cov-2 would be preferable, as it would be safer and have higher activity, but it might be technically difficult to mass produce. 84 several pharmaceutical companies are starting to develop hyperimmune immunoglobulins against covid-19. 88, 89 monoclonal antibodiesthe use of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against il-6, has recently been suggested as a treatment for covid-19 patients at risk of cytokine storms. 90 tocilizumab is an il-6 inhibitor that may be effective in treating covid-19. 91 the level of il-6 was found to be correlated with the severity of covid-19 and levels of c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, and t cells. 90 a retrospective study of 20 covid-19 patients receiving tocilizumab found that 75% of them had decreased oxygen requirement. 92 according to the diagnosis and treatment protocol from the china national health commission and state administration of traditional chinese medicine, tocilizumab can be used in patients with extensive pulmonary lesions and in patients with increased il-6 levels. 66 clinical trials on the efficacy of intravenous tocilizumab as a treatment for covid-19 are ongoing. 93, 94 however, serious adverse effects have been reported including gastrointestinal perforation, anaemia, hepatitis, and infusion reaction.tcm employs phytotherapeutic formulations and cultural concepts that originated more than 5000 years ago. 95 the use of tcm as a coadjuvant therapy in the early stage of the sars infection epidemic was reported to increase oxyhaemoglobin arterial saturation. 95 a cochrane review found that chinese herbs combined with western medicines in sars patients could improve symptoms, quality of life, and absorption of pulmonary infiltration, as well as decrease the corticosteroid usage. 96 specific components such as glycyrrhizin, baicalin, and mol376 were shown to have anti-sars activities in vitro. [97] [98] [99] over 85% of sars-cov-2 patients in china received tcm, which has been reviewed by yang and colleagues. 100 the use of tcm was included in the chinese national treatment guidelines for covid-19 patients and was recommended for different stages and severity of disease (table 2) . 66 however, the effectiveness of tcm in treating covid-19 patients still remains unclear. well-designed, large-scale, randomised, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of tcm before making any recommendations on their use in the management of patients with covid-19.other complementary therapies such as high doses of vitamins, acupuncture, and exercise have been suggested to promote health. however, there are no reports of specific targeted effects on coronaviruses, and there are no randomised trials of complementary therapies as treatments for covid-19.several case series reported that combination therapy could be effective in treating patients with covid-19 patients. 101 a single-centre case series of 89 hospitalised patients with covid-19 (54 non-icu and 35 icu patients) treated with a combination therapy of moxifloxacin, lopinavir, interferon, and methylprednisolone (given to only icu patients) showed good treatment effects and the mortality rate was less than 1%. 101, 102 in another study of 51 covid-19 patients, 10 (19.6%)

in children might be accounted for by the lower exposure and relatively mild clinical presentation in the paediatric population. many of the mild and asymptomatic cases are often overlooked and therefore go undiagnosed.comparing the immunopathology of sars-cov-2 infection between children and adults could reveal the pathology of the disease and might lead to possible treatment strategies for 'recurrent' novel coronavirus infections. there is currently no approved antiviral treatment for patients suspected of or confirmed with covid-19. research on the sars and mers epidemics and data from in vitro studies show that antiviral therapy may be beneficial. antiviral therapies and adjunctive treatments should, therefore, be considered in covid-19 patients with the unstable clinical condition or clinical deterioration or in patients with comorbidities. as the covid-19 situation develops, we will learn more about the safety and efficacy of specific treatments, and treatment recommendations are likely to change to reflect the latest evidence.at the time of writing, the most urgent issue is to curtail the spread of covid-19. vaccines could be the answer to this crisis, but vaccines are likely many months away and will take time to scale-up and manufacture on a global scale. in the meantime, public health officials should be focusing on nonpharmaceutical interventions. measures such as personal hygiene, wearing masks in the general population, social distancing, surveillance programs for testing suspected cases, lung and spleen qi deficiency syndrome french pinellia 9 g, chenpi

patient died. 103 in a case report of a 45-year-old woman with covid-19 treated with thalidomide (100 mg orally once a day) and methylprednisolone (40 mg intravenously bid for 3 days then reduced to once a day for 5 days), she had overall improved status, increased oxygen index, decreased symptoms of nausea and vomiting, and lower cytokine levels. 101 however, we cannot draw any definitive conclusions from this single case report as there was no control.although sars-cov-2 is the third re-emergence of a coronavirus in the past two decades and has abruptly put a halt to most social and economic activity around the world, the consequences of which are immeasurable. 122 this pandemic will undoubtedly change our daily habits and social routines and should serve as a huge wake-up call that has shown the vulnerability of the human race. for now, the global battle against covid-19 continues, and together, we will inevitably defeat the coronavirus. hard lessons will be learned that will better prepare us for the next pandemic.early quarantine, vigilant contact tracing, and preventing healthcare-related transmission are key factors to stopping the covid-19 pandemic. 108 although a safe and effective treatment has yet to be found, the sheer number of clinical trials that have started since the beginning of the epidemic is nothing short of impressive. combining advanced technologies in the field of genomics and computer science, potential treatments could be identified through machine learning, complex molecular dynamics, and artificial intelligence. with the joint efforts of research communities around the world, we are hopeful that an effective treatment or vaccine for covid-19 can be developed in the near future. 109 this pandemic should also raise the

at: https://www.drugsincontext.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dic.2020-4-15-coi.pdfsince the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) in 2002, the emergence and expansion of endemic and epidemic coronaviruses has been accelerating on a scale not seen for any other group of viruses with pandemic potential. in the past two decades alone, five new human coronaviruses have been discovered, three of which are highly pathogenic. 1, 2 the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is just the latest example of the danger posed by zoonotic diseases, foreshadowed by the regional, but unabated, emergence of middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus (mers-cov). 3 in recognition of its intrinsic threat to public health and as a prototypical member of the family coronaviridae, who, in 2015, prioritised mers-cov as a pathogen to which increased resources should be dedicated for countermeasure research and development. the newly established coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations followed suit with investments in the development of candidate mers-cov vaccines. 4 in subsequent years, three vaccine candidates have completed initial clinical evaluation and are now ready for advanced testing. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] in the lancet infectious diseases, two groups 8,9 report results from phase 1 clinical trials of non-replicating viral vector mers-cov vaccines. pedro folegatti and colleagues 8 summarise the safety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, chadox1 mers, and till koch and colleagues 9 do the same for a poxvirus-vectored vaccine, mva-mers-s. the two vaccines demonstrated tolerable safety profiles (no vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported for either vaccine) and induced humoral and cellular immune responses at peak, post-vaccination timepoints. chadox1 mers was administered as a single injection, whereas mva-mers-s was given as a two-dose regimen, with a 28-day interval between doses. both products were tested in a dose-escalating design. although the frequency and severity of adverse events were proportional to vaccine dose in both studies, only higher doses of chadox1 mers improved immunogenicity. a single dose of chadox1 mers also showed an earlier ascent and slower decay of antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity although the question is applicable to many viruses, the answer to this question has been elusive among coronaviruses. 10, 11 without previous identification of a potential correlate of protection, it becomes difficult to ascertain the relevance of immunogenicity outputs. second, there remains a lack of consensus on the methodology by which immunogenicity outputs are measured. 12 although the two trials report similar assessments of humoral responses-binding antibody, wild-type mers virus, and pseudovirus neutralisation assays-it is difficult to know how these individual results compare between studies. koch and colleagues 9 found a strong correlation between binding and neutralising antibody titres (spearman's correlation r=0·86 [95% ci 0·6960-0·9427], p=0·0001), whereas folegatti and colleagues 8 did not (spearman's r=0·28, p=0·175). does this represent an immunologically relevant difference between vaccine-induced responses or a methodological difference between laboratories? finally, some animal studies suggest that certain sars-cov and mers-cov vaccines might, upon viral challenge, be associated with eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. this finding underscores the importance of factoring safety into the design, monitoring, and longterm follow-up of coronavirus vaccine trials-something that cannot be fully addressed in the two early-stagefor more on the report by who see https://www.who.int/ blueprint/about/r_d_blueprint_ plan_of_action.pdf for more on vaccine candidates see https://brightoncollaboration. us/brighton-collaboration-cepicovid-19-web-conference/ mers vaccine trials herein, but which will undoubtedly be considered in future efficacy trials.the experience with sars and the emergence of mers, particularly during the outbreaks of 2014-15 in the arabian and korean peninsulas, were harbingers of the consequences of covid-19, and similar pathogens, on all sectors of society-not only in overall morbidity and mortality, but also in the capacity to level economies and disrupt social order. 13 if mers has been eclipsed by its pandemic cousin, then the lessons learned have prepared the global vaccine research and development community for moving coronavirus vaccines forward at an accelerated pace, such that first-in-human covid-19 vaccine trials are moving on unprecedented, shortened timelines. to stay ahead of these increasingly frequent outbreaks, the field must maintain momentum in advancing rapid, scalable, and translatable vaccine strategies, not only for mers-cov, but even more urgently for sars-cov-2 and, ultimately, the next novel coronavirus that leaps from its animal host to humans.
