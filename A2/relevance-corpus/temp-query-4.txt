<NUMBER> however one credible hypothesis simply children develop symptoms less frequently body reacts better virus get infected rather get infected less frequently cdc <NUMBER> lu et al <NUMBER> research needs done case would mean children subtle vectors disease cannot easily identified sources contagion isolated represent big threat vulnerable case flu vaccine one reason targeting children children likely infect others likely get infected case covid<NUMBER> might well children likely infect others large part infection less likely detected case something moment uncertain vaccination policy targets children would likely effective thus depending number variables indirect immunity might well confer protection elderly vulnerable population groups direct vaccination case would ethical implement vaccination policy targets children order protect elderly kinds ethical concerns might raised policy prioritizes children access covid<NUMBER> vaccine order protect elderly address consider following two cases folic acid intake pregnant women widely accepted least permissible morally required women get adequate intake folic acid pregnant folic acid prevent serious risk disease disability future children spina bifida folic acid recommended typically added basic everyday food breakfast cereal bread normally seen unproblematic actual benefit folic acid women people general minimal unless specific health conditions folate deficiency anaemia actually cases folic acid contraindicated example rare cases people experience allergic reactions including anaphylaxis nhs <NUMBER> yet commonly accept least permissible encourage introduction certain substance persons body order benefit someone else paediatric bone marrow donation donating stem cells sibling relative bone marrow donation commonly accepted practice including donor child kind donation often necessary save recipients life example cases leukemia compatible donors cannot found timely manner practice invasive requires general anesthesia although bone marrow harvesting considered relatively safe risks nerve bone tissue damage well risks normally associated anesthesia including death procedure considered ethically acceptable even donor children legally competent make kinds decisions bendorf et al <NUMBER> case vaccinating children protect elderly similar two cases relevant respect cases targeting certain individual order benefit someone else cases main benefit accrues third party individual used benefit others although might sometimes benefits direct target intervention mother folic acid case also risks associated risk assessment clearly favourable direct target case bone marrow donation although targets legally valid consent procedure always possible bone marrow donation case intervention generally considered permissible long done way appropriately balances targets interests risks reasonable reasonable risk context means benefit could accrued another less risky way risks minimized proportionate combined benefits child others absolute risk sacrifice constitutes easy rescue could otherwise imposed child ordinary life savulescu hope <NUMBER> examples two main ethical issues arise treating someone mere means order benefit someone else targeting one person benefit someone else without targets autonomous consent using children means one concern vaccination policies targeting children benefit primarily elderly vulnerable might using children means protecting elderly generally using children benefitting collective alleviating burden healthcare systems greatest benefit vaccinating en masse accrue vulnerable ones indirect protection rather vaccinated children main problem strategy vaccine <NUMBER> safe <NUMBER> effective covid<NUMBER> vaccine exception human trials need demonstrate acceptable level safety effectiveness various population groups vaccine currently developed university oxford instance entering phase ii iii trials phase ii includes testing children aged <NUMBER> <NUMBER> thus safety effectiveness tested age group vaccines however trials never guarantee <NUMBER> safety <NUMBER> effectiveness ethical issues discussing paper would pressing could vaccine <NUMBER> <NUMBER> effective reason problem framed terms treating children means strategy fact would exposing level risk however small also even primarily sake protecting others children vastly benefit vaccine gain immunity vaccines risk zero situation may worse covid<NUMBER> problem urgent vaccine ever developed coronavirus covid<NUMBER> type although past research sars mers vaccines identified potential approaches mayo clinic <NUMBER> challenge requires new type vaccine developed research made faster new technologies deployed new adenovirus manufacturing platform adopted oxford university well nextgeneration gene sequencing <NUMBER> methods <NUMBER> need adopt use somehow novel methods vaccine quickly possible means vaccine may entering unchartered waters chance although still safe risks vaccine greater case conventional vaccines moreover benefit children may significantly less mortality rate children consistently around <NUMBER> similar flus mortality rate children rchpch <NUMBER> vaccine provides benefits children likely marginal especially compared benefits provided elderly thus issue whether vaccinating children using means arises might thought using individuals way morally wrong however using people means morally problematic per se many everyday interactions require service people encourage pregnant women take folic acid harvest bone marrow certain children save lives siblings using people means morally wrong people used means way harms way disrespectful even case could plausibly argued treating means morally wrong consent might rephrased consistently one formulation kantian categorical imperative saying morally impermissible treat people mere means kant put act treat humanity whether person person always time end never merely means kant <NUMBER> <NUMBER> extreme circumstances even treating people means way harmful disrespectful without consent may considered permissible prohibition treat people merely means weakens

case covid<NUMBER> vaccine stake valuable life many vulnerable people perhaps would even wrong treat children mere means unlike fictitious loop case described unlike bone marrow case sacrifice asking young people vastly smaller would need get vaccinated accept small risks vaccination vastly smaller fictitious loop case likely smaller worst similar risks case bone marrow donation case vaccinating children flu vaccine actually benefits children small proportion suffer significant consequences even die <NUMBER> vaccine comparatively safe covid<NUMBER> vaccine similar flu vaccine using children means protect elderly vulnerable using children means way also actually benefits children acquire protection covid<NUMBER> even covid<NUMBER> seems life threatening young children still disease cause complications level pain discomfort however small risk severe complications death even children thus whether reasonable use children determined vaccines safety children rate complications covid<NUMBER> vaccination profile similar flu would reasonable vaccinate children primarily benefit elderly risk reasonable think bone marrow donation permissible even treating one child means saving another one encouraging women take folic acid permissible even sake future child think vaccinating children protect elderly permissible far concern using someone means true bone marrow case folic acid case one might think special obligations toward family members require certain sacrifices people however sacrifice required individuals small case requiring sacrifices strong even absence special obligations sacrifice actually entails benefits case requiring even stronger second ethical concern children cannot autonomously choose vaccination two versions objection depending coercive vaccination policy adopt coercive covid<NUMBER> vaccination policy autonomybased objection applies coercive vaccination policies generally would require separate discussion relative weight autonomy either bodily autonomy parental autonomy compared considerations public health benefits vaccination fairness contributing public good herd immunity argued elsewhere considerations weigh favour compulsory vaccination eg giubilini <NUMBER>a giubilini <NUMBER>b giubilini savulescu <NUMBER> however paper want focus specifically targeting children future covid<NUMBER> vaccination policy regardless whether policy coercive concern autonomy specifically regard children target vaccination policies would childrens autonomy exactly autonomybased concern arises child bone marrow donation case however concern dismissed pointing children generally deemed competent make autonomous decisions health care disease prevention anyway normally accept parents make choices behalf targeting children cannot meaningfully infringe autonomy simply children relevant capacity autonomous decisions whatever capacity autonomous decision normally taken warrant right autonomous decision hence targeting children vaccination policies cannot infringe upon autonomy ethically relevant way simply autonomy infringed upon course older adolescents competent would exception case relevant autonomybased objection would one often raised compulsory vaccination said going address think child bone marrow donation permissible even children cannot provide valid autonomous consent think targeting children vaccination policies permissible far concern autonomy thus turn vaccination policy targeting children effective creating immunity collective level initial vaccine availability limited seem significant reasons prioritizing child access vaccine measure would likely effective would ethical objection kind policy far see way already happening children young people society broadly paying high cost sake protecting vulnerable children forced keep social distance peers cannot attend school prohibited accessing playgrounds inevitably pay high price huge economic impact lockdown present future elderly vulnerable people main victims virus young people children particularly arguably among main victims social measures implemented life going significantly impacted

whether strategy would effective effective lockdown enforced days unknown according predictions would led estimated half million deaths vaccine becomes available way ones likely lockdown many thought strategy would unethical would meant exposing certain people considerable risks illness deaths sake protecting others according view cannot make certain people sick order protect others immunity collective level take stance ethics kind policy rather want point strategy vaccinating children order protect vulnerable would follow logic seemed inform initial attitude uk government building

prisoners higher risk groups higher risk infection jails closed environments retail shop workers become higher risk group lockdown measures eased groups also essential restarting economy therefore bringing important social goods beyond mere contribution realising collective immunity considerations need taken account deciding groups target order protect groups contribute collective good generally importantly decision balance different considerations depend vaccines features example possibility one promising vaccine candidates effective preventing people getting sick eg developing

grocery store workers medical nursing school students others depends kind good want achieve eg protecting vulnerable restarting economy longer term economic benefits etc required achieve eg creating herd immunity allowing workforce safely quickly return full activity etc relative ethical weight different goods stake opportunity costs would need considered possible solutions point assuming vaccine

cancer ones life colored sudden awareness possibility dying participants described emotional responses shock anger anxiety fear cognitively expressed disbelief uncertainty questioning dying first thing think youre going die behaviorally accompanied crying shouting quiet withdrawal first worse understand could happened felt good hard blow moreover pretty ugly serious serious tumor scared thought going die day tomorrow participants aware something wrong struggling began diagnosis knew something wrong body example could hardly swallow like want see knew something wrong feeling well duration intensity struggling varied among participants however accounts aggressively fighting disease time participants realized struggling created additional life difficulties useful fact understood counterproductive moving forward living made pivotal choice let go struggling participants talked choice even talked choice however realization took time evolve felt stuck struggling needed stop enabled move toward accepting advanced cancer measure discussed participants chose stop struggling however struggling end first decision instead time new challenges treatment failure difficult illness problems arose struggling reoccurred example one participant poignantly described returning struggle physical suffering increased awareness dying present start thinking things like avoid thinkid rather dead like try think things like avoid thought think imagine really like every day would rather die suffering continuously like hope awareness dying arose symptoms increased forgetting advanced cancer stand best inside course give little head cancer bah cured seeing less strength less vitality well course give little thought oh many times forget cancer eh either laughs truth see pretty good progression stopped stopped moment cancer wakes struggling revisited called new choice let go rather stuck turmoil enabled moving forward next phase accepting accepting process acceding agreeing presence advanced cancer ones life along problems brought attain level peacefulness situation could occur struggling stopped participants used word accepting described choice viewed essential able move forward living important recognize accepting also process revisited many times life got challenging things new information illness problems acceptance depth accepting varied widely navigated time involved coming level agreement situation example diagnosis cancer cancer curable life might shorter person dying achieving degree accepting influenced awareness dying also involved illustrated participants moved awareness possibility dying toward accepting dying think im thinking day im going die mean thats mean want die please arrive arrive accepting turn enabled degree peacefulness contrasted sharply turmoil struggling accepting involved making pivotal choices agree include part ones life example several participants talked fully accepting cancer incurable instead hung hope even though cancer advanced still possibility cure one strategy facilitated accepting making sense ones situation enabled answering hard questions something wrong fault belief shared many participants situation came god god would take care particularly helpful making sense situation way supported accepting described gods hands active choice turn toward god others automatic reflection strong ongoing relationship god accepting enabled movement next phase living advanced cancer rather process figuring integrate advanced cancer ones life entailed working accommodate mitigate illness problems impact life living minimized taking awareness dying account accepting degree enabled development negotiated coexistence advanced cancer struggling stopped willingness consider making necessary life adjustments illness problems everyday problems living arose serious illness example problems moving incorporating demanding treatment regimens difficulty caring ones children due pain fatigue taking awareness dying account possibility time shorter need focus mattered life happens think bit little obstacle race first said ill see get daughters communion little another instances living advanced cancer involved challenging priority setting choices example one mother young children highly valued good mother however meant needed let go children close physically able care needed let go family members receive care needed heartbreaking enabled hang fact good mother good mother way mattered four strategies facilitated phase living advanced cancer time may short making life adjustments maintaining positive attitude normalizing hoping making life adjustments occurred accommodate illness problems treatments example one couple living small village found social interactions street neighbors problem constant focus others concerns illness couple adjusted life going next village coffee allowing pleasant outing together could attend life rather illness many participants spoke need balance dependence independence making necessary life adjustments tricky endeavor important accept assistance time essential maintain sense worthwhile reduce perception burden one participant explained depend someone never depended anyone need silence thats complicated maintaining positive attitude often expressed choosing see positive facilitated living well strategy enabled participants choose put attention example one participant longer able work quickly dismissed expressions gratitude small things still possible able shop groceries enjoy coffee friends see beautiful flowers another participant emphasized way need big things little things everyday life depend well guess learn value things every day right maintaining positive attitude recognized powerful influence experience living advanced cancer participants time many acknowledged sometimes difficult caused return struggling time time normalizing also focusing strategy like lens camera participants focused normal aspects life setting aside normal aspects ignoring minimized impact advanced cancer everyday life make effort continue normal life like person achieve gives strength say im normal life like one person feel alive sense make normal life person sick understand disease present society happened get accept sense normalizing trying live disease denying angry day touched try cope become little friend carry mean accept normalize cope significant illness problems treatments unable work could put aside reconstructed ones new normal minimizing impact participants even spoke explicitly normality death dying awareness dying constructing natural part life think seemed going last forever death mind matter course think times talk normally people prepared speak normality another participant stated way told doctor day know born die final strategy hoping involved open possibilities particularly important normalizing possible example extended hospitalization holding onto hope feeling better leaving hospital resuming enjoyable activities critical one participant explained one treatment work possibility another one would take strength choose hold onto possible treatments thankful treatment options piece puzzle living well advanced cancer awareness dying involved maintaining family social relationships ill person experienced supported sense loved accompanied experience critical needed balanced protecting loved ones unnecessary suffering participants deeply appreciated family members also experienced awareness dying generated suffering therefore made pivotal choices much information share called two characteristics phase sharing illness experience someone count b protecting loved ones table <NUMBER> someone count share experience highly valued generated immense gratitude well sense wellbeing despite serious illness participants counted different people different things often expanding circle support beyond immediate family caring physical presence family central participant feeling accompanied necessarily include talking together situation one participant explained life calmer wife day every night remains one children every night nice bad disease nice things come sharing experience someone count often meant relationships deepened however participants worried fact suffering also shared concerned burden led protect love protecting loved ones primarily focused selective communication involved carefully choosing tell tell tell setting limits aimed preventing alleviating suffering participants talked limiting sharing way protect moment way enable loved ones continue time illustrated awareness dying may shared family members discussion awareness first day knew bad disease say already know wanted ask lot family suffer want suffer gets excited every time raise issue say forget forget thats going come thing going tell interviewer would like talk would hurt say son im going die uphill struggle would hard time get complicated already know fools know know thus participants used two strategies balancing giving withholding information b relying much possible problem solving selfcare example one participant needed talk illness situation want burden family explained turned others diagnosed disease without fear increasing suffering participants resourceful caring self others phase termed reconstructing life living moved foreground advanced cancer moved pushed background focus living personally meaningful life albeit moments rather living illness many participants reported actively choosing life illness rather waiting break illness illness problems example one participant chose delay treatment take holiday sick need vacation said every day think always something related disease postpone treatment going change anything one week complete vacation helpful reconstructing life occurred context awareness dying recognition time precious two characteristics facets phase shifting attention outside oneself away illness b living moment participants shifted attention outside continuing make personally meaningful contributions family community society way supported valued human identity defined limited sickness participants talked contributing society leaving body science simply continued help others done planned wellbeing family death story saying goodbye family started ruminate thought dying told wife something done children heard somewhere helped prepare death said look im going leave youre going cry next step move thats tried transmit even tough seek help continue almost without realizing raised idea farewell liked lot silence living moment way maximizing precious time given awareness dying desire live fully possible involved two strategies intentionally present attend moments joy beauty b controlling thoughts participants explained present several ways people sick think different joy times think youre going die already expiration date say im going die try late possible time use live well live happy calm enjoy every day never know tomorrow come silence controlling thoughts involved actively stopping thinking particularly disease dying addition thinking ahead curtailed troubling thoughts related death dying particularly intrusive persistent resulted return struggling required energy determination control thoughts live life rather live illness poorly managed symptoms pain hospitalization interfered

virus think survivor think close patient examine patient junior another participant described feelings surviving virus considered survival reward god hard work patients outbreak let tell something sometimes feel survived disease god knows right thing contrast feelings obligation arguably seems altruistic action always case many healthcare providers participants expressed anxious safety selfprotection apparently seeming panic colleagues fear inducing stories told infected patients perceived severity clinical presentations virus contributed increased anxiety level consequently affected work performance willingness work risky environment despite fears participants perceived ethical employment related obligation provide care afraid know patients fever already get paranoid

frequently cited motivation volunteering belief participant’s skills needed therefore perceived ethical obligation volunteer noted one participant “for right thing felt like something could help wanted it” several participants noted commitment social justice health equity thus drawn serve people need experiences humanitarian health crises usually aftermath disasters <NUMBER> haiti earthquake past experience medical missions parts africa also motivators one participant stated “having worked previously close west african doctor friends die… can’t stand bear witness” fear self fear concern family friends even though participants highly motivated volunteer early unfolding reports<NUMBER> <NUMBER> led many participants question decision volunteer instead backing several said resigned going even though sense foreboding fatalism deployment “the week going go cdc said <NUMBER> million people could infected saw thought “i’m coming this…” family members especially parents want go led participants avoid telling anyone decision cases secrecy extreme recounted one participant “i didn’t tell parents… airport leaving” another participant similarly want tell people upcoming deployment “i didn’t really talk anyone left morbid feeling know scared…i don’t know felt morbid would like … oh better say goodbye case doesn’t come back” instead reassurances family friends negative reactions like common one participant recalled “there much hysteria…people thought going die felt like jumping cliff” training length quality training varied early stages epidemic participants already working parts africa reported received training nonaffected countries typically provided sponsoring agencies others received training cdc additional handson training deployment site participants especially deployed early epidemic felt received adequate training thus felt unprepared reported one participant “they sponsoring agency handed viral hemorrhagic fever guide read plane showed real idea doing” outbreak progressed cdc began offering extensive training facility anniston alabama subjects took training spoke highly especially respect confidence using required personal protective equipment ppe training complex process donning doffing ppe universally regarded critical keeping safe simulated practice working wearing ppe several study participants thought training address perceived lack cultural competency reported one participant “there’s lot beyond training infection control practices felt completely unprepared for… could definitely lot preparation cultural level…in terms cultural norms acceptances language perceptions westerners… would extremely helpful” perideployment first impressions measure multiple levels early humanitarian response ebola epidemic extraordinarily challenging health care facilities systems already severely resourced affected areas strained limit us health care workers even prior humanitarian deployments shocked local conditions one participant deployed early epidemic august <NUMBER> described first impression ebola treatment unit etu assigned “a real horror show” living conditions unexpectedly austere even previously volunteered resourcelimited countries participants said provided bed mosquito net running water potable water electricity working toilets showers scarce making difficult maintain personal hygiene lack organization role clarity lack organizational management medical mission reported noted people charge making poor decisions especially regarding scheduling assignments problems compounded lack communication clear policies procedures lacking one participant noted “it seemed like policies formed whoever charge person charge changed every three hours” severe staff shortages participants perform new types tasks one physician noted “i hadn’t put iv probably <NUMBER> years mix drugs typically part daily workload certainly stressful” others reported feeling underutilized one nurse stated “i felt like wasn’t effectively used resource sense spent like <NUMBER> weeks time kind menial tasks didn’t another role us play” lack resources international teams arrived help set functioning etus delivery care extremely constrained lack staff also lack basic resources medical supplies equipment infrastructure facilities lacking beds running water sanitation electricity etc systems management protocols care delivery one participant noted “it absolutely resource limited setting” etus patients housed based health status availability beds cases cots mattresses floor family members placed room regardless health status recalled one participant “seeing horror person ebola yet still alert sharing room family members succumbing evd terrible terrible thing see” feasible health care workers continuously monitoring patients housed etus sometimes patients room extended periods others died ebola many patient deaths including deaths unrelated evd thought directly linked lack resources retold one participant “i remember one baby four months old suspected evd… mother died time minimal staff lack electricity concerns safety night shift baby lying mattress obviously really dehydrated soiled cleaned baby tried feed baby …and didn’t diapers baby bottles didn’t small enough ivs even attempt iv…we went several times day fed baby syringe gave acetaminophen… next morning went baby dead mind baby basically starved death baby wasn’t symptomatic ebola” feelings depersonalization types extreme experiences led participants feel emotionally withdrawn patients one participant noted “i felt like way protect continue productive it’s really hard desensitize like to… protective measure” fear contagion illnesses suggestive evd thoughts getting infected uppermost concern especially beginning deployment still becoming acclimated etu whenever breach infection control protocol practice fear constant one participant recalled constantly thinking “don’t let get ebola don’t let get ebola” many reported getting sick deployment symptoms suggestive ebola infection fortunately none participants study became infected ebola nine cases evd reported among us health care volunteers one death<NUMBER> <NUMBER> illnesses experienced deployment believed related contaminated food andor water difficulties personal protective equipment infection control protocols donning doffing procedures ppe time consuming taking <NUMBER> minutes working etu ppe also reported uncomfortable claustrophobic spite limitations ppe strict adherence infection control measures within etus strongly encouraged one participant noted “when you’re getting ready go nurses would huddle make plan decide going what…and would say prayer group going in…basically safe return see side” several noted time actually entered etu already sweating profusely goggles fogged high heat humidity made impossible work etus longer <NUMBER> hours ppe also seen barrier patient care one participant summarized experience ppe “you best body language voice…you’re always hurry hour really putting risk passing heat always rushed clock ticking… think felt guilty rushing way around it” altered standards care ethical conflict many participants remarked hardest part delivering patient care etus adjustment altered standards care us adhere basic fundamental ethical principles patient care include respect persons autonomy concepts beneficence nonmaleficence harm justice fairness patients recognize emergency situations may require alterations usual practices due resource limitations many participants reported nothing could prepared constraints faced inability provide quality level care participants used delivering important source stress frustration noted one participant “even ivs considered invasive procedure…there ward people could go get them…not many people got go ward—even critically ill still healthy enough could justify taking iv ward… didn’t qualify iv they’re probably going die anyway” nevertheless participants manage adapt one nurse reported able keep going constantly reminding “i’m best that’s do” witnessing unnecessary patient suffering due shortages drugs resources extremely disturbing participants lack pain medications especially concerning reported one participant “we didn’t narcotics pain control really challenging didn’t fentanol didn’t morphine didn’t anything like that” others recalled wishing could give patients small measure comfort one nurse said “even little things could mean lot like get cold coke would amazing treat didn’t little things would made feel happy maybe even help little bit hard” another key source concern many participants witnessing undignified death noted one participant “it’s one thing die alone it’s another thing die environment hot dark theres plastic tarps chlorine smell you’re cot people come wearing big suits leaving die way suffering days yourself… remember vividly” participants prior experience patients dying none previously experienced mortality rates high one participant recalled “literally bodies stacking outside ward…i mean many days six eight occupied body bags lying outside ward… many bodies” one physician recalled “<NUMBER> patients <NUMBER> patient etu died… every day” safety security sample <NUMBER> participants <NUMBER> reported breach ppe working etu although etu common place subjects felt risk exposure also potential exposure community one participant recalled upon reporting local community health center “i walked local doctor caring patient clearly ebola decided treat patient beds available etu didn’t touch anything still walked could imagine kinds ways would idea ebola right nose” prevention ebola exposure common cause concern participants concern maintaining personal security also source worry one participant victim violent mugging “i got jumped mugged everything stolenpassport credit cards everything… bruises mentally actually thought going die couldn’t trust anyone anymore” several participants mentioned feeling threatened community members angry afraid etus health care personnel working family members etu patients also sometimes threatened violence driving one location another additional cause concern recalled one participant “there definitely sense hostility deployment areas even though ebola team sign car checkpoints get car hand passports anxiety would happen” fatigue workload taxing staffing limited patient load extremely heavy least two participants said started deployment working <NUMBER> hour shifts six days week one participant reported etu <NUMBER> patients day even though originally designed <NUMBER> people two staff members staff shortages participants said felt guilty took day rest noted one participant “the one day week policy honor system many didn’t abide it’s guilt feel… obviously local health care workers aren’t taking day patients aren’t taking day so…it initially recommended eventually required strain became apparent” couple times participants felt overwhelmed exhausted considered leaving one noted “we discussions whether stay end always decided stay” postdeployment quarantine sense isolation participants reported reentry experiences stressful illustrated following recollection “the airport awful… sent back little office … coughed one time led put room equivalent jail cell metal bench metal toilet without lid camera two doctors full ppe came questioned me” sample participants returned home placed home quarantine also reported extremely stressful time one participant noted “i <NUMBER>day mandatory quarantine observation period actually oddly found traumatic part whole thing come small town everyone kind knows everyone else’s business family basically convinced going die ebola moment quarantine parent’s room utensils plates bathroom wasn’t allowed touch anyone maintain three foot radius times wasn’t even able close conversation” another participant mentioned lost lot friends quarantine “nobody would even pick phone awful” lack physical contact quarantine problematic many physical contact many months one participant reported touched single person early november end january “and suddenly… <NUMBER> days public health nurse came house day <NUMBER> realized over…and don’t ebola gives hug… like…oh god…you’re first person touched <NUMBER> months now…like i’m terrified miss <NUMBER> foot bubble felt secure someone reaches handshake hug … i’m like sure know you’re doing” even quarantine period wanted alone recalled one participant “as soon quarantine everyone wanted things go back normal nothing happened…but didn’t want see anyone used alone” still least one participant reported positive experiences upon return “most people great problem <NUMBER> freaks it” stigmatization lack appreciation participants reported felt ‘anger’ ‘resentment’ family members friends upon return felt unprepared reactions around expressed one participant “no one wants around even quarantine like oh gosh people don’t want around felt naïve stupid foreseeing like making plans like nothing wrong nobody wants deal you” wanted validation risks taken volunteering wanted public know put lives risk help protect others participants felt efforts helped people west africa directly affected also helped prevent spread ebola countries including us wanted authorities confirm volunteers reckless rather selfless felt like heroes wanted appreciated volunteer efforts instead reported feeling stigmatized upon return one participant stated “people selfish worried health ebola response effort health wellbeing total populations” another participant felt attitude us “i’m us doesn’t involve care” several participants experienced stigmatization family members reported one participant “not fear stigmatization family well mom volunteers school… told come in” grief depression guilt leaving participants reported feelings grief mourning sadness depression remorse regret upon return one participant said “oh could done much much more” others reported feeling emotional roller coaster one participant noted “i felt disappointed defeated times felt ‘ok everything could good’ nightmare” another participant described felt upon return “i total mess right back work everyone wanted tell amazing felt horrible inside hard dialogue people it” difficulty sleeping also reported problem several participants returned home several mentioned offered mental health services upon return although utilize reasons using varied “i didn’t think needed time” “it impersonal phone skype” use offered services found useful one participant particularly grateful occupational medicine physician called checked wellbeing days weeks returned home general participants feel received adequate counseling resources expressed remorse leaving ebola deployment assignment completed noted one participant “i want leave <NUMBER> weeks really hard leave still many people needing care still many cases much felt like abandoning people including nationals still working there” selfdoubt disillusionment reentry stress symptoms ptsd reflections upon return several participants started doubting meaningfulness deployment one participant reported “i whole questioning role humanitarian response…and stigmatization following it… know kind came fact dirty humanitarian response going dirtiness nothing altruistic clean fair think everything complicated everybody purpose helping out” another participant noted “the deployment really eye opener showed deficits within international humanitarian organizations” many dismayed inequalities saw us health care workers local health care workers especially terms treatment worker became ill also upset fact local health care workers sometimes receive promised pay transitioning back everyday lives difficult many one participant recalled “when come back don’t grieving time don’t work emotions everything put everything hold” time wasn’t time debriefing help reacclimatize returning homes hindsight think would really good debriefing” others mentioned feeling isolated people felt could really talk understood feeling people deployed noted one participant “you breathe eat sleep <NUMBER> hours every day it’s like come back home relax family heart it” another participant similarly found reentry disquieting “reentry really really rough spent lot time sitting office staring office mostly internalized drank lot” several doubted would another deployment like certain conditions would place one said “i’d know making huge difference worth freaking miserable <NUMBER> days” sadly others reported loss sense purpose life returned one physician reported “simply put i’ve lost way got back problems still felt like finished way living worries—you’re gonna die anyway outbreak reforming new life tough guess could call ptsd i’m proud did… personal life i’ve paid heavy price” positive reflections despite predominantly negative findings positive experiences feelings noted well instance
