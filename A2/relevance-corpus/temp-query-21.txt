the covid-19 global pandemic caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has presented a major public health challenge. for reasons that are not completely understood, the per-capita mortality from covid-19 varies by several orders of magnitude between countries. 1 numerous sources of heterogeneity have been hypothesized. higher mortality has been observed in older populations and in men. 2, 3 patient-level behaviors, such as smoking, might also have an impact. 3 other potentially relevant factors include economic activity, and environmental variation, such as temperature. 4 more urban settings and increased population density would be expected to enhance viral transmission. 5 in addition, public health responses to the covid-19 pandemic may influence per-capita mortality. various strategies have been implemented, ranging from robust testing programs to lockdown or stay-at-home orders, to mandates regarding social distancing and face mask usage. practices with theoretical benefit, such as social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and implementation of mandates regarding use of masks in public spaces, must be assessed quickly, as implementation has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality.mask usage by the public is postulated to decrease infection by blocking the spread of respiratory droplets, 1 and was successfully implemented during other coronavirus outbreaks (i.e. sars and mers). 6 in the context of the ongoing pandemic, we assessed the impact of masks on per-capita covid-19-related mortality, controlling for the aforementioned factors. we hypothesized that in countries where mask use was either an accepted cultural norm or favored by government policies on a national level, the per-capita mortality might be reduced, as compared with remaining countries.methods.data from 183 countries for which coronavirus mortality and testing data were available were retrieved from a publicly available source on may 9, 2020. 7 archived testing data for april were also downloaded. 8 the date of the country's first reported infection and first death were obtained from the european centre for disease prevention and control. 9 mean temperature in each country during the pandemic was estimated using the average monthly temperature in the country's largest city from public sources. 10, 11 online news reports were searched to identify countries in which the public wore masks early in the outbreak based on tradition, as well as countries in which the . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

countries (p<0.001, table 1 ).urbanization was associated with coronavirus mortality. in low-mortality countries, on average 55% of the population was urban, as compared with 70% of the population in the high-mortality countries (p<0.001, table 1 ). richer countries suffered a higher coronavirus related mortality. the mean gdp per capita was $10,570 in the low-mortality countries, and was $27,600 in the high-mortality countries (table 1 , p<0.001).in some asian countries, masks were used extensively by the public, essentially from the beginning of the outbreak, 1,24 including: thailand, 25 japan, 24, 26 south korea, 24, 27 taiwan, 28 hong kong, 24, 29, 30 vietnam, 31 malaysia, 32 cambodia, 33, 34 and the philippines 35 (table 2 ). in fact, in mongolia 36 and laos, 37 the public began wearing masks before any cases were confirmed in their countries. despite the fact that the outbreak tended to appear in these 11 countries quite early, the countries had experienced a low per-capita coronavirus mortality by may 9 (mean 1.9 per million, sd 2.5, table 2 ).the world health organization initially advised against widespread mask wearing by the public, as did the united states cdc. 1,

significant predictors of the logarithm of each country's per-capita coronavirus mortality included: duration of infection in the country, duration of wearing masks, percentage of the population over age 60 , and urbanization (all p<0.001, table 3 ). with the duration of infection in the country controlled for, there was a trend for time in lockdown to be negatively associated with mortality, and for percapita testing to be positively associated with mortality, though neither association was significant (table 3 ). in a population not wearing masks, the per-capita mortality tended to increase each week by a factor of 10 0.171 = 1.48, or 48%. on the other hand, in a population wearing masks, the per-capita mortality tended to increase each week by a factor of 10 (0.171-0.148) = 1.054, or just 5.4%. compared with the baseline condition (without masks), under lockdown, the per-capita mortality increased each week by 10 (0.171-0.039) = 1.36, or 36% (table 3) . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0

suffer a mortality 21% higher (10 0.0838 = 1.21). a country in which the percentage of the population age 60 or over is 10% higher than in another country will tend to suffer mortality 231% higher (10 0.52 = 3.31, table 3 ).the trend towards a positive association with testing by may 9 probably reflects the greater recognition of coronavirus-related mortality with more testing, as well as the increased incentive countries have to test when they suffer a more intense outbreak.as noted above, testing was positively associated with mortality. by may 9, 2020, low-mortality countries had performed 1 test for every 510 members of the population, while high-mortality countries had performed 1 test for every 82.6 members of the population (p<0.001, table 1 ). presumably, testing performed early on would better help to contain the outbreak. by april 4 (the earliest testing data archived), lowmortality countries had tested 1 in 63,300 in the population, as compared with 1 in 1,710 in the high-mortality countries (p<0.001, table 1 ). by april 16, 2020, low-mortality countries had tested 1 in 2,340 in the population, as compared with 1 in 251 in the highmortality countries (p<0.001, table 1 ). if early testing lowers mortality, one might expect negative regression coefficients (more testing associated with less mortality). however, when (log) per-capita testing on april 4, 2020 was included in the model in table 3 (which also includes later testing), early testing was not inversely related to mortality (coefficient = 0.01, p=0.83). likewise, when (log) per-capita testing on april 16, 2020 was included in the model in table 3 , early testing still tended not to be inversely related to coronavirus mortality (coefficient = 0.21, p=0.11).only 5 countries had performed over 1 test for every 10 people in the country by may 9, 2020 (in order of most testing to least): the faeroe islands, iceland, the falkland islands, the uae, and bahrain. the faeroe and falkland islands reported no coronavirus-related deaths. the remaining 3 countries had per-capita mortality above the median value. the highest per-capita mortality among this group was 29.0 per million population (or 1 in 34,480 people), seen in iceland.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

great deal of variation between countries in related mortality. countries in the lower half of mortality have experienced an average covid-19-related per-capita mortality of 1.1 deaths per million population, in contrast with an average of 101 deaths per million in the remaining countries. independent predictors of mortality included urbanization, fraction of the population age 60 years or over, duration of the outbreak in the country, and the period of outbreak subject to cultural norms or government policies favoring mask-wearing by the public.these results support the universal wearing of masks by the public to suppress the spread of the coronavirus. 1 given the low levels of coronavirus mortality seen in the asian countries which adopted widespread public mask usage early in the outbreak, it seems highly unlikely that masks are harmful. one major limitation is that evidence concerning the actual levels of mask-wearing by the public are not available for most countries. particularly in western countries which only recommended (rather than mandated) mask-wearing by the public, such as the united states, the practice has been steadily increasing, but change has not occurred overnight. our analysis based on norms and policies can be compared with "intention-to-treat" analysis in a clinical trial.much of the randomized controlled data on the effect of mask-wearing on the spread of respiratory viruses relates to influenza. one recent meta-analysis of 10 trials in families, students, or religious pilgrims found that the relative risk for influenza with the use of face masks was 0.78, a 22% reduction, though the findings were not statistically significant. 48 combining all the trials, there were 29 cases in groups assigned to wear masks, compared with 51 cases in control groups. 48 the direct applicability of these results to mask-wearing at the population level is uncertain. for instance, there was some heterogeneity in methods of the component trials, with one trial assigning mask wearing to the person with a respiratory illness, another to his close contacts, and the remainder to both the ill and their contacts. 48 mask-wearing was inconsistent. the groups living together could not wear a mask when bathing, sleeping, eating, or brushing teeth. [49] [50] [51] in one of the studies reviewed, parents wore a mask during the day, but not at night when sleeping next to their sick child. 51 in a different trial, students were asked to wear a mask in their residence hall for at least 6 hours daily (rather than all the time). 49 the bottom line is that it is nearly impossible for people to constantly maintain mask wear around the people with whom they live. in contrast, wearing a mask when on public transit or shopping is quite feasible. in addition, as an infection propagates through multiple generations in the population, the benefits multiply exponentially. even if one accepts that masks would only reduce transmissions by 22%, then after 10 cycles of the infection, mask-wearing would reduce the level of infection in the population by 91.7%, as compared with a non-mask wearing population (because 0.78 10 = 0.083). it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever randomize entire . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 25, 2020. .countries or populations to either wear, or not wear, masks. public policies can only be formulated based on the best evidence available.a recent study demonstrated that in 4 patients infected with sars-cov-2 who were asked to cough without and with a cloth mask, the viral load on a nearby petri dish was reduced with the cloth mask in all patients, and in half was not detectable with the cloth mask. 52 nationwide policies to ban large gatherings and to close schools or businesses, tended to be associated with lower mortality, though not in a statistically significant fashion. however, a full accounting would consider local policies, which often varied within each country. moreover, businesses, schools, and individuals made decisions to limit contact, independent of any government policies. the adoption of numerous public health policies at the same time can make it difficult to tease out the relative importance of each.colder average monthly temperature was associated with higher levels of covid-19 mortality in univariate analysis, but not when accounting for other independent variables. nonetheless, environmental factors which could influence either human behavior or the stability and spread of virus particles are worthy of further study.per-capita testing both early (april 4, 16) and later (may 9) were positively associated with reported coronavirus-related mortality. it seems likely that countries which test at a low level are missing many cases. we previously identified just 3 countries (iceland, the faeroe islands, and the uae) which had performed over 75,000 tests per million population by april 16, and all 3 had mortality below 1 in 46,000 at that point. 53 by may 9, we could add to this "high-testing" group, the falkland islands and bahrain, as all 5 countries had tested over one tenth of their population. all 5 countries had a mortality of 29 per million (1 in 34,480 people) or less. the degree to which these results would apply to larger, less isolated, or less wealthy countries is unknown. statistical support for benefit of high levels of testing might be demonstrated if additional and more diverse countries are able to test at this level.one limitation of our study is that the ultimate source of mortality data is often from governments which may not have the resources to provide a full accounting of their public health crises, or an interest in doing so.in summary, older age of the population, urbanization, and longer duration of the outbreak in a country were independently associated with higher country-wide percapita coronavirus mortality. lockdowns and the amount of viral testing were not statistically significant predictors of country-wide coronavirus mortality, after controlling for other variables. the use of masks in public is an important and readily modifiable public health measure. societal norms and government policies supporting maskwearing by the public were independently associated with lower per-capita mortality from covid-19.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

world's attention is focused on the news of the coronavirus pandemic. right now it is difficult to assess the true extent of this pandemic, since the number of infected people depends on the number of tests performed, and the number of deaths from coronavirus depends on the specifics of cause-of-death registration in each particular country or even region. for this reason, many researchers analyzing the influenza epidemics do not analyze mortality from a specific cause, but rather mortality from all causes, since it is almost impossible to make a mistake in the fact of death. the coronavirus pandemic is not the first pandemic in human history or even the first pandemic in the last 200 years. the most famous and deadly is the 1918 spanish flu pandemic (viboud and lessler 2018) . in the post-war years, the 1969-70 influenza pandemic was also causing significant losses not only among the elderly (which are usually observed during regular influenza epidemics), but also at middle ages (rizzo et al. 2007) .in this paper, we consider the patterns of mortality during the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 using the data for italy and the usa. these countries are currently leading in the number of persons infected with covid-19. an analysis of mortality in 1918 and the adjacent years may help us to better understand the course and scale of the current pandemic. statistical yearbooks published shortly after 1918 in the respective countries were used as a data source. for italy, these are primarily ministro di agricultura, industrie e commercio (maic), direzione generale della statistica (dirstat) (maic 1924 (maic , 1925a (maic , 1925b . for the u.s. data we used vital statistics rates in the united states 1900-1940 edition (bureau of the census 1943). the age-specific mortality rates for the italian population are taken from the human mortality database (human mortality database).first, consider the trends of mortality rate in 1916-1919 in italy and the usa. figure 1 shows the values of crude death rates (per 1000 population) by calendar year for italy. you can see that mortality rose sharply in 1918, but in subsequent years it fell quite rapidly. the crude death rate in pre-war 1913 is given for comparison, because of significant war losses in italy in 1916-1918. in 1919, mortality already returned to the pre-war values. a similar pattern is observed for mortality trends in 1916-1920 in the united states (see figure 2 ). as in the case of italy, in the united states there was a surge of mortality in 1918 and a fairly rapid drop of mortality in 1919.however, it is well known that the spanish flu epidemic passed in waves and the first cases of flu were recorded in the united states in march 1918, and the second deadly peak of the spanish flu was observed in the fall of 1918. to better understand the development of the spanish flu epidemic in 1918 and 1919, it makes sense to consider changes of mortality from all causes by month.monthly mortality changes in 1918 and 1919 in italy are shown in figure 3 . it follows from the figure that the acute phase of the spanish flu epidemic was observed in the fall of 1918 with a surge of mortality in october. by april 1919 this elevated mortality wave totally disappeared. at the same time, the spring peak of the spanish flu epidemic in 1918 had practically no effect on the total mortality. figure 4 shows monthly mortality changes in italy for 1916-1919. it follows from the figure that the spanish flu spring wave had little effect on total mortality, which was almost the same in the first half of 1918 as in the previous two years. however, an increased number of deaths from influenza (spanish flu) was reported in italy in 1919 and even in 1920 (see figure 5 ). figure 6 shows monthly mortality changes in the united states. in this figure, one can see a slight increase in mortality in the spring of 1918, which looks insignificant compared to the peak of mortality observed in october. as in the case of italy, a decrease in mortality to normal levels occurred by april 1919. figures 4 and 6 show that the acute phase of the pandemic with very high mortality lasted from one to two months, but a complete mortality decline to normal levels took about eight months. now consider age-specific mortality changes in 1917-1919. in the case of current coronavirus pandemic it is observed that older people are more likely to die from coronavirus than younger ones. this observation is not surprising. the analysis of mortality italy in 1969-2001 demonstrated that older people die more often during regular flu epidemics (rizzo et al. 2007 ). however, during the 1969-1970 pandemic the excess mortality was observed not only at older, but also at middle ages (rizzo et al. 2007 ). the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 differs from other flu epidemics by significant relative increase of mortality at middle ages. figure 7 shows the age-specific mortality rates for italian women in 1917-1919. the figure for italian men is not given here due to significant war losses in 1917-1918, distorting the age-specific mortality pattern. figure 7 shows a significant increase in mortality between the ages of 15 and 60 years during the spanish flu pandemic in 1918. in 1919, an increased mortality rate among middle-aged women was also observed. while after the age of 65, mortality does not change. at the same time, we cannot say that mortality at older ages was unaffected by epidemic. figure 8 shows age-specific mortality of women after age 65 in italy in 1917-1919. it can be seen that the spanish flu epidemic has added an additional mortality increment in 1918 to already high mortality rate at old age.effect of the spanish flu epidemic on mortality can also be analyzed using time series of mortality data with the method of latent variables (gavrilovet al. 2017; gavrilova and gavrilov 2011) . to this aim, we conducted a factor analysis of mortality over the period of 1900-2014. we used so-called p-technique of factor analysis when the analysis occurs across different time points or observations (values of hazard rates at different years) for ages 25 through 85. we applied factor analysis procedure with promax rotation method using the stata, release 13 statistical package. we identified two factors capable of explaining almost 98% of the variance in the temporal changes of hazard rates. thus, mortality evolution in italy can be described by the following model: μ x, t = α 0 x + α 1 x f 1 t + α 2 x f 2 t where x is age, t is time, α(x), α 1 (x), α 2 (x) are three sets of parameters depending on age only, while f 1 (t) and f 2 (t) are two sets of parameters depending on time only (sets of coefficients determined by factor analysis models).by studying the variation of these factors over time, we noted that the first factorcomparable to the senescent mortality (gavrilov and gavrilova 1991; willmoth 1997) and chiefly concerning the «old ages» population -remained remarkably stable over a period of 1900-1950 (see figure 9 ). the second factor -comparable to the background mortality (gavrilov and gavrilova 1991) and observed in the «young» population -declined from the beginning of the century. figure 9 shows the trends in background and age-related (senescent) mortality factors in italy. in this figure, peaks of background mortality are noticeable in 1918 (the epidemic of spanish flu) and in the 1940s (world war ii). this figure shows that in italy the effect of the spanish flu epidemic on mortality was even stronger than the effect of hostilities during the world war ii. it is also seen that subsequent influenza epidemics did not have a noticeable impact on background mortality.the data presented here clearly demonstrate that the spanish flu pandemic cannot be compared to the later flu epidemics and pandemics of influenza by its effect on mortality. a distinctive feature of the 1918 pandemic was a high percentage of deaths among young and middle-aged people with a relatively low increase in mortality among the elderly. studies have shown that this phenomenon was observed among the population of europe and the united states, but in the more remote regions of latin america and the pacific islands, the mortality of the elderly from the spanish flu was even higher than at younger ages. it is believed that exposure to influenza viruses in childhood could have a protective effect in the elderly in europe and the usa during the 1918 pandemic (simonsen et al. 2018 ).returning to the epidemic of coronavirus, it should be noted that there is a certain similarity in the damage to respiratory system produced by the coronavirus and the spanish flu virus, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (cilek et al. 2018) . right now we can do only preliminary estimates regarding the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on total mortality. the italian institute of statistics (instituto nazionale di statistica) regularly publishes the number of deaths from all causes for some municipalities on its website (www.istat.it). according to these data, during the period from march 1 to march 28, 2020, 29,565 people died in the studied municipalities of italy. during the same period of 2019, 14,603 people died in the same municipalities. thus, the number of deaths in the studied municipalities of italy in march 2020 doubled. for comparison, the death toll in italy in october 1918 (the peak of the epidemic) was five times higher than in october 1917. in the united states, mortality in october 1918 was 3.6 times higher than in october 1917. these data suggest that the coronavirus epidemic must be taken seriously. yet the coronavirus epidemic has significant differences from the spanish flu epidemic. the main difference is that the group with the highest risk of death from coronavirus is mainly elderly people with burden of chronic diseases, although deaths of healthy middle-aged adults also occur. mortality at older ages is highly seasonal, mainly due to seasonal influenza epidemics (rosano et al. 2019) . therefore, the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on mortality can be better assessed by studying the entire set of data on seasonal mortality, including data for 2020, which are currently insufficient. one can only assume that the coronavirus epidemic is likely to lead to a parallel upward shift in mortality for ages over 20 years (in semi-log coordinates), similar to what happened during the spanish flu epidemic for ages over 60 years (fig. 8) . some optimism is inspired by the fact that the acute period of the spanish flu epidemic with unusually high mortality did not last long -one to two months. it should be remembered that the waves of the epidemic continued after 1918 until 1920, but their impact on the total mortality was negligible. therefore, we can hope that in the case of coronavirus pandemic, the acute phase heralded by mortality surge will not last long. crude death rate (per 1000 population), by calendar year in italy. source: maic 1924 , 1925a , 1925b popul econ. author manuscript;

such populations provide an opportunity to estimate the mortality which might occur after many members of a population have been exposed.the covid-19 outbreak occurring on the diamond princess cruise ship in february 2020 has resulted in the deaths of 14 passengers, and has provided a window into the effect of the virus in the elderly. 1 in the united states, the large populations of new york state and city, the epicenter of the national outbreak, provide an opportunity to estimate mortality in children and young adults. finally, as of may 6, 2020, 109 new york metropolitan transit authority (mta) workers have died from coronavirus. [2] [3] [4] this population provides an opportunity to estimate the mortality in older working adults, and has not been previously studied, to our knowledge.we estimated from publicly available sources the coronavirus-related mortality for each age group on the diamond princess cruise ship, in the united states (nationally), in new york city and state, and among new york metropolitan transit authority workers. [2] [3] [4] the age breakdown of new york city's population was determined by dividing the covid-19 deaths by the mortality rates reported by the new york city department of health. 5 the new york state population age breakdown was obtained from the census. 6 the united states population, total and by decade, were tabulated. 7, 8 results.among children in new york city (ages 0 to 17 years), the coronavirus mortality was estimated to be 1 in 173,000, with a 95% ci of 1 in 360,000 to 1 in 94,000 (tables  1-2 ). 5 nationally, infants under age 1 tended to have a higher mortality (1 in 947,500), compared with children age 1 to 14 (1 in 9,517,000) ( all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 18, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20094847 doi: medrxiv preprint 1 in 54 1 in 76* 1 in 21 *larger datasets permit the lower bound for the mortality among exposed populations to be determined with greater certainty. therefore, for the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (ci) for ages 30-39, the lower bound of the ci for ny state residents age 30-39 is listed. for the lower bound of the 95% ci for exposed age 70-79, that of ny state residents age 70-79 is listed. for the lower bound of the 95% ci for exposed age 80 and over, the lower end of the ci for nyc residents age 75 and over is listed. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 18, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20094847 doi: medrxiv preprintthe new york mta has 74,000 employees, most of whom are represented by the transport workers union. 11 in total, 106 of the 109 mta workers who had died of coronavirus as of may 6, 2020 were in the subways and buses division, which has 55,000 employees. 12 of the 68 new york city mta workers who died of coronavirus, and whose ages could be determined from public sources, one was in his 30s (1.5%, 95% ci 0.04-7.9%), 9 were in their 40s (13.2%, 95% ci 6.2-23.6%), 29 were in their 50s (42.7%, 95% ci 30.7-55.2%), 25 were in their 60s (36.8%, 95% ci 25.4-49.3%), and 4 were in their 70s (5.9%, 95% ci 1.6-14.4%). none was younger than 39 or older than 73. the agedistribution of known deaths was applied to the 106 total deaths in the bus and subways division to estimate the numbers of deaths in each decade (table 5 ). [2] [3] [4] 13 the age distribution of mta employees is: 18-25 years (1.7%), 26-35 years (16.0%), 36-54 years (53.1%), 55-62 years (22.8%), and over 63 years (6.4%). 13 from this distribution, the number of the 55,000 bus and subway workers was calculated for each age decade (table 5) .among new york mta workers during the pandemic, the mortality was estimated to be 1 in 7,329 for ages 30-39; 1 in 1,075 for ages 40-49; 1 in 343 for ages 50-59; 1 in 178 for ages 60-69 (tables 2, 5).

[15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] for ages 70 to 79 years, the mortality was 1 in 145, with 95% confidence limits from 1 in 357, to 1 in 70 (tables 2, 6). a lower bound for mortality in exposed populations from 70 to 79 years of age comes from the data of new york state, where the mortality was 1 in 184, with 95% confidence limits of 1 in 189 to 1 in 179 (tables 2, 4).four diamond princess passengers in their 80s died of covid-19. [21] [22] the mortality was for this age group was 1 in 54, (95% ci 1 in 196, to 1 in 21, tables 2, 6). a lower bound for mortality in the exposed elderly is obtained from the data of new york city, where the observed mortality for ages 75 and over was 1 in 74, with 95% confidence limits of 1 in 76, to 1 in 72 (tables 1-2).the mortality for these age decades on the diamond princess might actually be higher, but the ages of 2 of the 14 passengers who died was not disclosed (table  6 ). 23,24 all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the

https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20094847 doi: medrxiv preprintthis study found that the mortality from coronavirus among highly exposed populations is heavily dependent on age, ranging from about 1 in 170,000 under age 18, to 1 in 54 for those in their 80s. it will be important for all people, especially older adults, to take precautions to avoid infection. the strength of this study is that our method did not require estimation of the prevalence of infection or case fatality ratios (since there is no consensus about these values yet). it should be emphasized that the tabulated mortality rates are not infection fatality rates (fractions of infected people who die). rather, the listed mortality rates are the fraction of the entire population who died.children seem to be at a low risk of mortality from coronavirus, around 1 in 170,000 in new york city to date. however, the national data do suggest that infants may be at a higher risk of coronavirus-related mortality than other children. as schools have been closed during the pandemic, the exposure of children to the virus, even in new york, was in all likelihood less than that of the other groups studied (mta workers, diamond princess passengers). presumably, if schools reopen, the mortality among children will increase. still, it is likely that the mortality among children will remain several orders of magnitude below that of older adults.the mortality among young adults age 20-39 is fairly low, but still an important consideration for both individual and institutional decision-making. one new york mta worker in his late 30s died of coronavirus. a second new york transit worker in his mid-30s died of coronavirus, though technically he was not an mta employee, and therefore, did not factor in our analysis. 2 the new york state data confirms that these deaths of workers in their 30s were not unprecedented. it would be useful if localities (and national authorities) could release coronavirus demographic data broken down with more granularity. for instance, colleges would be most interested in the data from age 18-22 years. this was the first study of the mortality among new york transit workers, to our knowledge. analysis of this group helps to characterize the mortality among older working age adults. the first confirmed case of coronavirus infection in new york city was reported on march 1, 2020. 25 the mta workers were forbidden to wear masks and gloves until march 8. 26, 27 on march 26, two mta workers died from coronavirusthe first mta workers to suffer this fate. 28 an announcement that the mta would provide the workers with masks on came on march 27. 29 on april 4, 2020, the mta was able to obtain 250,000 n95 masks for the workers. 30 on april 15, the governor of new york announced an order to require that after a 3-day notification period, the public would be required to wear masks when unable to socially distance, such as on public transit. 31 therefore, there was a delay of 5 weeks between presence of the infection in the city and the mta obtaining masks, and of 7 weeks until the public was required to wear masks when in transit.all rights reserved. no reuse

this version posted may 18, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.20094847 doi: medrxiv preprint based on the new york transit worker data, the mortality risk among exposed populations continues to increase progressively in the 40s and 50s. the sole fatality on the uss theodore roosevelt, on which a coronavirus outbreak occurred, was a 41year-old sailor. 32 in highly-exposed populations, the fraction of the population infected has been less than 100%. on some ships with outbreaks, all on board were tested. on the uss theodore roosevelt, 856 of 4845 sailors (17.7%) tested positive for the virus. 32 on the diamond princess, 619 of 3,711 passengers (16.7%) tested positive for coronavirus, only half of whom were symptomatic. 1 among new york mta workers, a group which was not universally tested, over 6000 workers (8%) have either tested positive (over 2000), or entered quarantine (4000 workers). 33 in these populations, it is not known if those who tested negative were false negatives, were tested at the wrong time, had less exposure than their fellow passengers or workers, or were less susceptible to infection.this study has a number of limitations. if the diamond princess passengers or mta workers had not all been exposed to the virus, then the observed mortality underestimates the potential mortality. also, there might be differences between the diamond princess population or the mta workers and the population at large. the mta workers were mostly minorities, and one could argue that they suffered excess mortality because of preexisting medical conditions. on the other hand, many of the most disabled are excluded from working or travelling at sea. our study did not estimate the mortality among nursing home patients, which has been substantially higher than that of the general population.all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv

information (isi) web of science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to infection outbreaks. the results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus covid-19. during the period of december 29, 2019 through march 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. the infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age. the mean growth rate index for total number of cases from january 23 to march 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12.there was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (r 2 =0.996). the novel coronavirus covid-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. it is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. the global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. however, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the covid-19 epidemics.key words: biological trends, coronavirus, covid-2019, 2019-ncov, prevalence, outbreak.viral infections are the most frequent infectious diseases and are common triggers for constituting major health and socio-economic harms (meo et al., 2020) . in late december 2019, an earlier named novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), currently named as coronavirus (covid-19) emerged from wuhan, china, resulted in a challenging outbreaks in many regions in china and expanding globally. human infections with coronavirus covid-19 have raised great public health apprehension globally. in the third millennium, three major threatening infectious diseases outbreaks happened. following the outbreak of sars-cov in 2002 (zhong et al., 2003) and the mers-cov in 2012 , the novel coronavirus "covid-19" has emerged globally and has threatened the entire world. the coronaviruses are zoonotic infections, can be transmitted from animal to animal, animal to human, and human to human (li et al., 2020; world health organization 2020) .the covid-2019 first appeared in the last week of december 2019. the infection cases were originated from bats, snakes, seafood among people living in or visiting wuhan, china and human-to-human transmission has also been confirmed (world health organization, 2020; wang et al., 2020; callaway and cyranoski, 2020) . the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality rate are changing daily.initially, china bears the large burden of the diseases, whereas the incidence is gradually increasing in other countries mainly the europe and united states of america. despite recent efforts to understand the novel coronavirus covid-19, the science community, researchers and general population would like more information about the current biological and epidemiological situations. this study aimed at investigating the mutable biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality outbreaks of coronavirus covid-19 infections.this study was conducted in the department of physiology, college of medicine, king saud university, riyadh, saudi arabia. we obtained data on biological and epidemiological trends, global number of confirmed cases, and number of deaths due to coronavirus covid-19 infections all around the world. the data were obtained from the world health organization (who), centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and reports from various countries and their allied ministries to the who. we also obtained data from search engines including (worldometer-coronavirus). moreover, we also reviewed the literature published in the institute of scientific information (isi) web of knowledge, thomson reuters, pub-med, medline, and appropriate findings were recorded. we assessed the growth factor, a factor by which quantity multiplies itself over time; daily cases divided by cases on the previous day. a growth factor more than 1.0, indicates an increasing pattern, whereas values between 0-1.0 show a decline pattern (worldometer-coronavirus).in this study the information on the biological and epidemiological trends on global prevalence and mortality due to novel coronavirus covid-2019 infections was obtained from the world health organization, worldometer-coronavirus, the centers for disease control and prevention and reports from various countries and their allied ministries to the who; hence ethical approval was not required.the data were recorded and analyzed, and the results were expressed in numbers and percentages. the regression analysis was performed; and a p-value <0.05 was considered significant.these results are established from the available information at the time of publication originating from the mentioned sources. the data were interpreted with carefulness however, the outbreak is evolving rapidly and there is swift change in the numbers. the global number of cases and number of deaths due to novel coronavirus covid-19 infection are presented in table i (table 1 ). in these contents covid-19 highly effected the various countries including united states of america, italy, france, spain, germany, switzerland, and iran ( figure 1) . however, the highest mortality rate was found in italy, spain, united kingdom, france and iran ( figure 5 ). the outbreak of novel coronavirus covid-2019 started on december 29, 2019. the results shows rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus covid-2019.in this study, we also analyzed the daily cases and death growth factors of the coronavirus covid-2019. it was identified that during the january 22 to march 31, 2020 the growth factor of the number of cases worldwide was 0.28 to 6.96 (mean 1.20) and the growth factor of death rates was 0.51 to 2.17 (mean 1.12).there was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (r 2 =0.996). it showed a mutable change in both the daily case growth factor and mortality rate (figure 3 ).coronavirus infection is an emerging global health concern and has infected a significant portion of the world's population. in this study, we investigated the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus covid-19 infection. the covid-19 infection is expanding over 198 countries and territories, infected 750890 people, has caused 36405 (4.84%) deaths during the period december 29, 2019 to march 31, 2020 (table i) .the coronavirus covid-2019 infection is rapidly transmitted, the disease is still in its spreading phase with predictions of infection expand to over one people globally. we have derived the estimates of the ongoing covid-19 epidemic and found that still the mean growth factor for number of cases and mortality rate is more than 1.0. it is highly contagious because of its biological characteristics (meo et al., 2020) . it is a zoonotic disease with person-to-person transmission through droplet or contact transmission (wu et al., 2019) . infected people can transmit the disease before they present clinical symptoms (rothe et al., 2020) . this is the main reason that the disease could swiftly spread from wuhan, china to various corners of the globe. more recently, the epicenter of the diseases appears to have shifted from wuhan, china to the european world and mainly italy, and united states of america (world health organization, 2020). many countries including china, italy, saudi arabia, new zealand, poland, ireland, denmark, spain, france have cancelled international flights and implemented the world's largest and most restrictive quarantines policies to minimize the further transmission and disease burden. for the prevention of the spread of the disease, these countries are not permitting people to enter or leave the country without strict screening of the passenger for covid-2019 infection at airports. (quilty et al., (2020) evaluated the usefulness of thermal passenger screening for covid-19 infection at airports exit and entry points. the authors found that effectiveness of entry screening was dependent on the effectiveness of the exit screening at the destination. the authors identified that 46% of the infected travelers were not detected, because of the incubation period, and asymptomatic or subclinical cases (chan et al., 2020) . (quilty et al., 2020) also reported that airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of covid-19 infected travelers. the screening is intended to be a barrier for preventing infected people from entering into the country; however, evidence of its effectiveness remains limited. these are reasons that health officials are still unable to control the spread of this contagious disease. the transmission of the disease is closely linked to the asymptomatic and infected people and those visiting the countries with covid-19 pandemic. (figure 4) . the disease is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends.the epidemiological trends show that novel coronavirus covid-19 is highly contagious and has affected 750890 people, with a mortality rate of 4.84%. the number of cases were proportional to the number of deaths. there was a great fluctuation in the biological and epidemiological trends both in the growth factor of number of cases and the mortality rates. global health officials have taken high priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe, but still the coronavirus covid-19 is swiftly spreading with mutable biological trends. the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating the dire need for enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations to control the covid-19 epidemics.researchers supporting project number (rsp-2019/47), king saud university, riyadh,

countries, infants and preschool children have viral infection 6-10 times in a year, and school-age children and adolescents have 3-5 times in a year. 1 in a study published by american centers for disease control and prevention in 2015, pathogens were detected in 80% of 2,254 pneumonia cases in patients aged between a day and 17 years, 66% of these pathogens were viruses. 2, 3 viruses may cause several clinical conditions that require hospitalization in a picu such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia, chronic lung diseases, and more severe manifestations such as myocarditis, encephalitis, and sepsis. besides the known agents, recently new generation viruses including human metapneumovirus (hmpv), coronavirus, and bocavirus have also been lead to cause these manifestations. 4, 5 in this study, it is aimed to bring out the clinical characteristics of patients who had viral infections requiring picu admission during winter season in turkey.initially descriptive properties of variables (mean, median, number, and percentage) were found. numerical variables were checked for normal distribution. student t test was used for normally distributed numerical variables. mann-whitney u test was used for variables with no normal distribution when two groups were compared. in comparison with the numerical values of multiple groups, anova was used for variables with normal distribution and kruskal vallis test was used for variables with no normal distribution. comparison of categorical variables was carried out by chi-square test and fisher exact test. the most effective presenting finding on mortality was revealed with regression analysis. multivariate regression analysis was performed for determining mortality risk factor. critical ph and pco 2 value were found with the roc curve. roc analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between blood ph and mortality. the p-value <0.05 was considered as significant. the results were evaluated using the statistical package for social sciences -spss 17 (chicago, usa) program.data of 302 patients with severe viral infections were followed in picu of 16 centers in turkey. out of 302 patients, 113 (37%) were girls and 189 (63%) were boys. mortality rate was 7.6% (23/302). the mean prism score was 37.2±13.2 in patients who died and 11.1±10.3 in patients discharged (p <0.001). median age of patients was 12 months. forty-seven percent of patients were under one year of age and 53% of patients were over one year of age. mortality rate was 9.2% and 6.3% in each age groups, respectively (p = 0.34). it was seen that 45.7% of the patients were admitted to the emergency department, 24.2% were admitted to the inpatient service of the same hospital, and 23.3% of the patients were accepted from the inpatient or emergency services of other hospitals. the mean duration of symptoms before admission to the hospital was 3.9±2.8 days. duration of stay in picu was between one day and 116 days, hospital duration was between two days and 120 days.symptoms were cough in 78.1%, fever in 62.5%, nasal discharge in 45.6%, gastrointestinal symptoms in 20.8%, neurological symptoms (seizures, changes in consciousness) in 17.5%, and rash in 4.6% of all patients. hypoxia was found in 49%, tachypnea in 43%, fever in 40%, tachycardia in 34%, and hypotension in 7% of patients. physical examinations revealed respiratory findings in 86%, prolonged capillary filling in 32%, neurological findings in 14%, and gastrointestinal system findings in 10% of all patients.indication of picu admission was respiratory dysfunction in 71.5%, circulatory dysfunction in 10.2%, neurologic dysfunction in 7.6%, and mods in 10.5% of patients. at the time of admission and in follow-up, respiratory failure was observed in 91.3%, cardiovascular failure in 22.1%, hematological failure in 15.2%, renal failure in 10.2%, and hepatic failure in 9.9% of patients. in regression analysis, mods was found as a predictor for mortality [odds ratio: 20.5(95%), confidence interval (ci): 5.8-72.1; p = 0.00].anemia was found in 45.4%, leukocytosis in 17.8%, leukopenia in 14.2%, thrombocytosis in 19.8%, thrombocytopenia in 14.9%, prolonged inr in 26.6%, and electrolyte imbalance in 74.8% of patients. acidosis was found in 55.2%, alkalosis in 5.9%, high pco 2 in 37.7%, and elevated lactate in 56.9% of patients. the mean lactate value was 6.3±6.1 in patients who died and 2.7±2.5 in patients who were discharged (p <0.001). in regression analysis, acidosis was found to be a predictor for mortality (odds ratio 2.5(95%) ci, 1.2-4.8; p = 0.007). it was found that ph ≤7.10 negatively affected survival (specificity 97.9% and sensitivity 26.3%). pco 2 ≥60 mm hg was also shown to have negative effect on survival (specificity 78.1% and sensitivity 68.4%). clinical and laboratory findings at the time of admission of patients associated with mortality are shown in table 1 and age-related discriminating factors are shown in table 2 .anterior-posterior chest radiograph revealed positive findings in 86% of patients (infiltration in 74%, atelectasis in 9%, pleural effusion in 5%, and pneumothorax in 4%). no statistically significant difference was found between the patients who died and discharged in terms of chest radiograph findings. out of all, 53.3% patients had underlying disease [neurologic in 17.8%, respiratory in 16.5%, cardiovascular in 12.5%, immunological in 6.2%, hematological-oncological in 5.9%, renal in 2.3%, and others (metabolic disease, chromosomal anomalies) 9.5%]. sixty percent of patients who died had underlying disease. this rate was 52% in discharged patients (p >0.05).the total number of viruses detected in nasal swabs of patients hospitalized in picu, number of viruses when multiple reproductions were included and excluded in the patients who died, mortality rates when the viruses were evaluated in themselves are shown in table 3 . multiple viruses were detected in 13% of all patients. multiple viruses isolated was in 17.3% of the patients who died and in 13.2% of the discharged patients (p >0.05). for patients detected with a single-virus infection, there was statistically no difference between the species of the virus, between patients who survived, and patients who died (p = 0.195). when the viruses were evaluated among themselves and patients with multiple viruses were excluded, 37% of patients with coronavirus were found to have died (table 3) .median age of patients with influenza was 41 (11-75) months and median age of patients with the viruses other than influenza was 10 (3.5-28) months (p <0.001). the median prism score was 22 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) and median pelod score was 11 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) in patients with influenza. the median prism score was 9 (3-17) and median pelod score was 10 (1-15) in patients with the viruses other than influenza (p <0.005). the relationships between the indication of picu admission, organ failures at the time of admission or revealed at follow-up, and species of viruses isolated are shown in table 4 . among all, 60.2% of patients received antiviral therapy, 94.3% antibiotic therapy, 15.8% antifungal therapy. 47.4% of patients who died, and 61.6% of the patients discharged received antiviral therapy (p = 0.22). the median duration of stay on mv was 4 (2-5) days, median duration of stay in picu was 7 (4-15), and median duration of hospital was 15 (10-27) days in patients who received antiviral therapy. the median duration of stay on mv was 3 (2-5) days, median duration of stay in picu was 7 (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) , and median duration of hospital was 15 days in the patients who did not receive antiviral therapy (p >0.05). it was found that virus species did not affect mortality between patients who received and did not receive antiviral therapy (table 5) . of all, 92.3% of patients required respiratory support treatments. renal replacement therapy was performed in 6.6%, plasma exchange in 5.2%, and ecmo in 1.9% of patients.viral respiratory tract infections are the most common infections worldwide. they are the most important cause of mortality in all age groups, particularly in children. 7 this retrospective observational study was conducted in order to analyze the course of seasonal viral infections of respiratory tract in patients hospitalized in picus of 16 centers representing the whole country. there are a bunch of studies in literature investigating the relationship between viruses and morbidity, comparison of single-multiple viruses or relationship between diseases and viruses. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] current study is multi-directional and has comprehensively analyzed all these issues in a very large population requiring picu. viral respiratory tract infections constitute significant proportion of patients admitted to picus in winter, and these patients require advanced intensive care support with high mortality and morbidity rates. in line with this, our study group shows a very high mortality rate as 7.6%, which supports the justification of this multicenter survey. although respiratory tract viruses commonly cause lower respiratory tract infections, presentation with extrapulmonary clinical manifestations are also likely in children under one year of age. 8, 19 similarly, the most common cause of hospitalization was respiratory symptoms in our study. fever, neurological symptoms, circulatory disorders, and shock were more common indications for hospitalization in patients under one year compared to older children (table 2 ). in patients over one year of age presenting with respiratory symptoms, hypoxia as well as a need for mv were more common. we attributed this situation to rsv, which was more frequently observed in this age group. in the literature, rsv is more prevalent in infancy for picu admission though influenza and bocavirus that was more common in our patients less than one year of age. 1, 9, 10 we statistically evaluated all initial symptoms (clinical, laboratory, and radiological) and virus species through four parameters (duration of stay on mechanical ventilation (mv), duration of stay in picu, duration of hospitalization, and mortality). accordingly, we assessed relationship among presenting symptoms, virus species, and severity of disease. it was observed that presenting symptoms that have an effect on mortality were neurologic symptoms, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. it was also found that liver and renal function test abnormalities, higher lactate values were related with death. eighty-seven percent of mortalities are presented with acidosis ( table 1 ). the critical ph value related with mortality and critical pco 2 was ≤7.10 and ≥60 mm hg, respectively. in regression analysis, acidosis alone was found to increase mortality by 2.5 folds. in the light of these findings, it can be predicted that patients with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, hypotension, low levels of pulse so 2 , acidosis, and impaired liver or renal function at the time of admission will have a higher morbidity and mortality.kumar et al. showed that organ failure in patients hospitalized in icu with h1n1 infection increased mortality. 11 also, kendirli et al. demonstrated the correlation between organ failures and mortality in the patients who presented with h1n1 infection. 12 similarly, in our study, mortality rates were higher and in regression analysis, we demonstrated that initial presentation with mods increased mortality by 20-folds.in a study, it was shown that rsv was the most common agent in patients who needed intensive care. 20 this is definitely compatible with our findings.spaeder and fackler reported that virus species did not affect durations of stay in picu and hospital, as well as development of mods and mortality. 21 in our study, we also investigated virus species organ failure relationship and emerging indications for picu admission. we demonstrated that there was no correlation between virus species and diagnosis of admission to picu or type of organ failure developed (table 4 ). however, 63% of the patients who died in 2017 winter season had rsv, parainfluenza or influenza. secondary bacterial agent was observed in about half of the patients who died. it is not easy to blame viral agents to be the leading causes of mortality because of the frequent accompaniment of secondary bacterial agents. similar to the literature, we found that secondary bacterial infections negatively affected mortality. 15, 22, 23 in the present study, multiple viruses were detected in 13% of the patients. although there are also contrary opinions, [24] [25] [26] detection of multiple viruses does not affect mortality and duration of stay in picu. 22, 27, 28 similarly, we showed that multiple viruses did not affect mortality.when multiple virus isolated patients were excluded, coronavirus revealed to be the most lethal virus as three out of eight patients with coronavirus died (table 3 ). coronavirus is known as the primary agent of upper respiratory tract infection and common cold. 29 coronavirus had been defined as the causal agent of sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which more severely progresses in adults, while the disease lasts shorter and shows milder progression in children. 30 unlike the literature, coronavirus presented severe symptoms with organ failures in our group of patients (table 4 ). lower respiratory tract infections caused by coronavirus types out of sars are rare and some studies found the incidence of pneumonia and bronchitis as <5%. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] therefore, in our study, the incidence of coronavirus was low that is consistent with the literature, but unlike that coronavirus caused lower respiratory tract infections and emerged as the most lethal viral agent (table 3) . however, 36% of the patients with coronavirus had secondary bacterial infections; so, coronavirus is not solely responsible for mortality. although secondary infections were found in only 16% of all patients, we found that 94% of the patients who presented with viral infections received antibiotics.sixty-two percent of the patients received antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) because antiviral therapy was started before nasal swab results in patients with severe infection findings. we found that antiviral therapy did not affect mortality (table 5) including the influenza subgroup. though, there are studies in literature showing that oseltamivir initiated in the early period was effective. [37] [38] [39] however, weakness of our study is that the data we gathered is not capable of differentiating the initiation timing for antiviral therapy. further studies are needed for this issue. influenza is already known as the only agent that benefits from oseltamivir. when we separately evaluated the influenza subgroup, we found the median patient age as 41 months and higher prism and pelod scores compared with rest of the viral agents. influenza was more common in older children and progressed more severely. therefore, oseltamivir can be preferred in children especially over one year of age and who presented with more severe symptoms because they are more likely to have influenza.consistent with the literature, comorbidities were common in the present study. 9, [12] [13] [14] 20 although 60% of the patients who died had an underlying disease, a statistical correlation is lacking as described in the literature. 9, 12 in our study, it was found that mechanical respiratory support was administered to the majority of the patients and renal replacement therapy was applied in the group, which had organ failure and progression. as expected, we found that prism and pelod scores were higher in patients who died.we found that tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, acidosis, impaired liver or renal tests, and mods at the time of admission are the factors associated with mortality and predictors of a severely progressing disease. it was found that acidosis increased mortality by 2.5-folds and mods by 20-folds. respiratory symptoms were common and besides respiratory symptoms, incidence of circulatory disorders and shock findings were also high in patients less than one year of age. fever, tachycardia, neurologic symptoms, the incidence of anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, impaired renal tests, and electrolyte imbalance were high in patients less than one year of age. consequently, acidosis and mods at the time of admission or a patient less than one year of age with symptoms mentioned above should alert clinicians for a possible poor prognosis. although we could not show the relationship of virus type with severity and mortality, rsv, parainfluenza, and influenza were the commonly isolated viruses in the patients who died. coronavirus was found as the most lethal virus. although coronavirus is known as the primary agent of upper respiratory tract infection and common cold, this result of our study can be attributed to the incidence of secondary bacterial infections being high in the patients with coronavirus detected. with this context, further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between coronavirus and mortality.in our study, we could not demonstrate effects of oseltamivir on mortality, duration of hospitalization, and stay in the picu including influenza subgroup but there are studies reporting that oseltamivir initiated within first 48 hours is beneficial. therefore, oseltamivir can be preferred in children who present with more severe symptoms because they are more likely to have influenza.methods: we performed a systematic review with meta-analysis, using five 35 databases to compare the predictors of death for covid-19, sars and mers. 36 a random-effects model meta-analysis calculated odds ratios (or) and 95% 37 confidence intervals (95% ci).results: 845 articles up through 11/4/2020 were retrieved, but only 28 studies 39 were included in this meta-analysis. the results showed that males had a higher 40 likelihood of death than females (or = 1.82, 95% ci 1.56-2.13). age (or = 41 7.86, 95% ci 5.46-11.29), diabetes comorbidity (or = 3.73, 95% ci 2.35-5.90), 42 chronic lung disease (or = 3.43, 95% ci 1.80-6.52) and hypertension (or = the authors declare having no conflict of interest related to this work. the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 pandemic of early 2020 poses an enormous challenge to global public health. coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by the virus has spread rapidly throughout the world, taking thousands of lives in just over 2 months. it is critical to refine the incidence and mortality risks of covid-19 for the effective management of the general public and patients during the outbreak. in this report, we investigate the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5,319 infected patients, 76 fatal cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in china. our results show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for seniors. notably, mortality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less.age-dependent risks of incidence and mortality of covid-19 in hubei province and other parts of chinaon january 7, 2020, a new pathogenic virus causing pneumonia was identified in a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient in wuhan, hubei province, china. the pathogen had typical features of the coronavirus family and therefore was classified in the subgenus sarbecovirus, orthocoronavirinae subfamily (1, 2) . this virus has been named "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (sars-cov-2), and the disease it causes has been named "coronavirus disease 2019" . it is the third epidemic coronavirus that has emerged in the human population in the twenty-first century, following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars) outbreak in 2002, and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers) outbreak in 2012 (3, 4) .coronavirus is one of the main causes of human respiratory disease owing to frequent crossspecies infections. the emerging virus rapidly became a challenge for global public health due to it spreading through human-to-human transmission. the majority of the earliest covid-19 patients were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market. however, human-to-human transmission has frequently occurred, and the epidemic has been gradually growing (5) . as of march 4, 2020, 80,566 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported in china. internationally, more than 14,396 cases had been reported in 77 countries (6, 7) . the number of infected individuals is far surpassing that of sars and mers. sars-cov-2 can cause severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. it has been reported that sars-cov-2 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, suggesting that age, and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcomes (8, 9) . in china, the reported death rate approached 3% of the total number of covid-19 patients during february 2020.at present, information regarding the prevalence and casefatality for the clinical features and epidemiology of covid-19 remains scarce. however, a relatively accurate evaluation of incidence and mortality is required to help refine the risk assessment and to ensure that the public and patients are managed in an effective way. therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the risks for individual groups of different ages and genders. in this paper, we report our initial analysis of the public data from local authorities. our study shows that the incidence risk of covid-19 might be as low as 0.1 for children, while it could be over 0.9 for 40-year-old adults. our results also suggest that the mortality risk might be above 0.2 for patients older than 80 years. notably, the mortality risk was significantly different between patients of hubei province and those from other parts of china.basic information on covid-19 cases was released on official websites by the national health commission of china and its local branches. we collected data from a total of 6,673 identified cases published before february 22. based on the completeness of the data, we involved 5,319 cases in our study. all the 5,319 covid-19 cases were residents outside hubei province. a total of 76 fatal cases were included in our analysis. among the 76 fatal cases, 45 cases were reported as residents of hubei province, and 31 cases were reported as residents of other parts of china. epidemiological characteristics such as age, gender, and location were carefully checked to remove missing values or duplicated records. the composition of the age of the general public was obtained from data of 1,144,648 individuals from the general census of china (2018) (10). the census data were collected from the whole country, including 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. ethical approval for this study and written informed consent from the participants of the study were not required in accordance with local legislation and national guidelines.we estimated the incidence risk of covid-19 for different age groups in the general public by a maximum likelihood approach. in this approach, given the age composition of the general public and the incidence risk of different age groups, age composition of covid-19 cases can be obtained aswhere p incidece age i is the incidence risk of age group i and p age i is the proportion of age group i in the general public. we assumed that the incidence risk for different age groups could be obtained from a logistic function of age,the likelihood of observation for age composition of 5,319 covid-19 cases can be maximized by searching for optimized µ and γ. consequently, the incidence risk can be achieved in a maximum likelihood approach where the risk is given by a logistic function of age with estimated parameters µ and γ.to assess the mortality risk of covid-19 in the general public, we used a maximum likelihood approach that is similar to that mentioned above. we obtained the age composition of fatal cases of covid-19 as p age i infection, mortality = p mortality infection, age i p age i infection i p mortality, age i infection ,where p mortality infection, age i is the risk of mortality condition on an individual's age and infection state and p age i infection, mortality is the age composition of fatal cases of covid-19. in this study, we assumed that infection happens in all age groups for the general public and therefore have p age i infection = p age i . we further applied the maximum likelihood approach to obtain the mortality risk of covid-19 for different age groups in the general public p mortality infection, age i . in the maximum likelihood approach, the mortality risk was given by the aforementioned logistic function of age but with mortality-specific µ and γ. to eliminate the concern that the high mortality risk of older people may inflate the mortality rate of the infected population, we further imputed the mortality rate of the infected people as, p mortality infection = i p mortality, age i infectionthe public data of a total of 5,319 identified covid-19 cases were included in our analysis. there were 2,829 (53.2%) males and 2,490 (46.8%) females in the covid-19 cases; the male to female ratio turned out roughly equal across all age groups. the age of covid-19 patients ranged from 0.5 to 97 years, with a mean of 45.2 years. the age and gender composition of covid-19 patients and the public reference are presented in table 1 . compared to the general public, the covid-19 cases had a higher average age, and there was a higher proportion of people aged 30-69 years.we collected detailed information on 76 fatal cases and plotted the age composition of the cases and the general public in figure 1 . it is evident that death occurs more frequently in older based on the age composition of 5,319 covid-19 cases and the 1,144,648 individuals of the general public, we estimated the incidence risk by a maximum likelihood approach. our results show that the disease can occur in all age groups, and there is no significant difference between males and females (figure 2) . the difference in incidence risk for different genders is observed only for the groups between 15 and 50 years old. after the age of 15 years, males have a slightly higher incidence risk than women, but the increase is negligible for people over 50 years old. our result does not support a previous report that sars-cov-2 generally affects more males than females in the epidemic (8) . the incidence risk is low for children and teenagers but rapidly increases for adults. for adults over 40 years of age, the risk is higher than 0.9 when they have full exposure to the virus.in our assessment of mortality risk, there is a significantly higher mortality risk in older adults ( figure 3a) . the estimated fatal probability is <0.01 for individuals under 40 years, but it is more than 0.51 for people older than 90 years. the calculated risk is much higher than previous reports stated. our result is consistent with most of the earlier studies, supporting the hypothesis that older age is associated with an increased risk of mortality in covid-19 patients. our analysis of the total of 76 fatal cases suggests a mortality rate of 2.38% for general infection. however, we noticed that the mortality rate of covid-19 in reports is significantly different between identified cases of hubei province and that of other parts of china (11) .to compare the mortality risk between hubei and other provinces of china, we divided 76 fatal cases into two subsets: 45 cases from hubei province and 31 cases from other parts of china. the aforementioned statistical analysis for mortality risk was applied to the two subsets, with nine different age groups in each. to account for variability, we further obtained a standard deviation of estimates by applying the same method to 1,000 simulated data sets that were generated from the initial estimation. our results show that mortality risk is no more than 0.13 ± 0.10 for people over 80 years outside hubei province, but the risk is as high as 0.60 ± 0.15 for the corresponding age group in hubei province ( figure 3b) . mortality risk falls under 0.05 for people younger than 70 years in other parts of china, while only people under 50 years have a risk under 0.05 in hubei province. we also calculated the expectation of mortality rates for a general infection inside and outside hubei province as 4.78 and 0.95%, respectively. our results suggest that there is a significantly higher mortality risk for covid-19 in seniors than that given in the previous report (11) . this is probably due to the published report not accounting for the increasing death rate of the identified covid-19 cases. in the previous study, the crude mortality rate was only 2.3%, but the rate was 3.7% on march 4, 2020 (3015 deaths among 80,566 identified covid-19 cases). as of march 4, 2020, there were still 5,952 covid-19 patients in critical condition in china. it has been reported that the survival probability of critically ill patients continuously decreased with the increase of time since admission to the intensive care unit (12) . our analysis was based on the composition of the age of the different populations, and therefore it is less affected by the disease progression of patients, especially the increasing death rate of critically ill patients. age has been reported as the independent predictor of an adverse outcome in sars and mers. comorbidities and low immune function in older people might be the major cause of a higher mortality of coronaviruses (3, 4, 11) . prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and the strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce the mortality of seniors (8) .our data showed that the mortality rate of covid-19 is five times higher in hubei province than that in other parts of china. this result is supported by an early publication that stated the estimated case fatality rate of mainland china excluding hubei was 0.15%, far less than that of the hubei province excluding the city of wuhan (1.41%) and wuhan city (5.25%) (13) . on the one hand, this difference may be partially explained by insufficient medical resources due to such a large number of patients in hubei province during the outbreak. according to the 2018 annual brief report of the health service development in wuhan city, there were 8.6 hospital beds per 1,000 people. however, hospital bed utilization ratio of 2017 and 2018 reached 92.34 and 94.22%, respectively (14) . it was shown that, even under normal circumstances, there were few spare beds. on the other hand, detailed information on the majority of fatal cases (40 of 45 in total) from hubei province was published before january 25, 2019. the mortality rate of early reported cases may be overstated, because case detection is highly biased toward the more severe cases. however, we strongly suggest that international authorities try their best to immediately prevent covid-19 patients from overloading their health care system. our hypothesis that a smooth-running health care system can effectively reduce the mortality rate of covid-19 is strongly supported by the low mortality rate in other parts of china.in conclusion, we investigated the incidence and mortality risks of the infection by analyzing the age composition of covid-19 patients and the general public in china. our data show a relatively low incidence risk for young people but a very high mortality risk for older adults. therefore, it is prudent to strengthen the tertiary preventive and clinical care of oldaged patients to reduce mortality. furthermore, our results also support the conclusion that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less. our study could be of value to medical authorities to implement effective medical service. the lack of complete data for all covid-19 cases potentially increases the occurrence of selection and measurement biases in this study. therefore, further large-scale epidemiological studies are necessary to elucidate the risk factors of covid-19 for the general public.all datasets generated for this study are available upon request.ethical review and approval was not required for the study on human participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements. written informed consent from the participants' legal guardian/next of kin was not required to participate in this study in accordance with the national legislation and the institutional requirements.coronaviridae represent a very important family of animal and human viruses [1 , 2] that are in permanent circulation. four common human coronaviruses (hku1, nl63, oc43 and e229) cause 10-20% of respiratory infections worldwide and are present in all continents [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ( table 1 ) . mortality is poorly assessed, but it is clear that there are chronic carriers as well as asymptomatic carriers. studies have shown that there are as many asymptomatic carriers as symptomatic patients [3 , 9] . three epidemic episodes of emerging coronaviruses have been reported. the first, severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus, had very little impact on global morbidity and mortality, with more than 80 0 0 recognized cases and 774 deaths [15 , 16] . the second, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)-coronavirus, remained localized in saudi arabia, with a small epidemic of mainly nosocomial infections in south korea [17] . mers-coronavirus, like sars-coronavirus, highlighted the major danger of nosocomial transmission to healthcare personnel, the health of whom is essential in these epidemics [18] . finally, sars-cov-2, the novel coronavirus that appeared in december 2019, has expanded and has now affected more than 90 0 0 0 people worldwide [2 , 19 , 20] . at the time of writing, a significant number of cases had occurred in the far east. it is incontestably contagious, as a quasi-experimental study on the diamond princess cruise ship showed that confinement of infected patients with uninfected patients resulted in rapid infection of the uninfected patients, leading to 700 additional cases on board [21] . however, coronaviruses in common circulation remain predominant because of their global distribution and their non-negligible mortality [14 , 22] . the aim of this study was to share the experience of a reference laboratory representing approximately 1% of serious and diagnosed respiratory infections, particularly seasonal, in france. this will allow the evaluation of the relative mortality of different human coronaviruses presented in hospitals in marseille compared with that of sars-cov-2.assistance publique-hôpitaux de marseille (ap-hm) covers all public hospitals in marseille, including four university hospitals: la timone hospital, conception hospital, north hospital and south hospital; this corresponds to 3400 beds and 125 000 admissions each year [23] . the ihu méditerranée infection diagnostic laboratory tests all samples from ap-hm in which respiratory viruses are suspected. molecular biology is used for diagnosis. the results are monitored by a weekly automated surveillance system in the diagnostic laboratory, coupled with a laboratory informa- [10] guangzou, china 13 048 244 (2.25%) zeng [11] guangzou, china 11 399 489 (4.3%) killerby [14] usa 18 806 2.2% kiyuka [13] kenya 5573 10.1% owusu [9] ghana 593

4 (1.05%) tion system (nexlabs) [23] . sars-cov-2 epidemiological data were obtained through an online platform gathering data from public agencies [24] . statistical analyses were performed using biostatgv software.in 2016, there were 594 0 0 0 deaths in france; 59.2% of these deaths occurred in a care establishment [25] . in the same year, ap-hm reported 2854 deaths. as such, it can be estimated that approximately 0.8% of deaths in care establishments in france occurred in ap-hm hospitals. this estimate provides an approximation of the number of people affected by a pathogen in france according to the number of people who died each year at ap-hm hospitals.from 1 january 2013 to 31 december 2019, 21 662 samples were tested by the ihu méditerranée infection diagnostic laboratory. among these, 770 samples were positive for coronavirus, with eight deaths (mortality rate 1%). among identified coronaviruses, 63 were identified as hku1 (one death, mortality rate 1.6%), 74 were identified as nl63 (two deaths, mortality rate 2.7%), 92 were identified as e229 (one death, mortality rate 1.1%) and 160 were identified as oc43 (four deaths, mortality rate 2.5%). three hundred and eighty-one coronaviruses, diagnosed before 2017, were not assigned to any of these four strains ( table 2 ) .systematic testing (molecular biology) for sars-cov-2 was performed from 1 january 2020 to 2 march 2020. in total, 7059 samples from patients presenting with infectious symptoms were tested by the ihu méditerranée infection diagnostic laboratory. among them, 543 samples were positive for coronaviruses, with two deaths (mortality rate 0.36%): 277 samples were hku1, 146 samples were nl63, 77 samples were oc43 and 43 samples were 229e. no cases of sars-cov-2 were identified among these sam- ples. of the two deaths, one patient had oc43 (mortality rate 1.3%) and one patient had hku1 (mortality rate 0.36%). there were no deaths from nl63 or e229 during this period. over the same period, ihu méditerranée infection was the regional centre for detection of the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2. at the time of writing, 596 analyses have been performed on suspected cases since the emergence of the novel pathogen, from which four cases of sars-cov-2 have been identified. in addition, 337 french nationals returning from hubei province have been tested twice, and all were negative for sars-cov-2.by 2 march 2020, a total of 90 307 patients have tested positive for sars-cov-2 worldwide, with 3086 deaths (mortality rate 3.4%). among the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) countries, 7476 patients have tested positive for sars-cov-2, with 96 deaths (mortality rate 1.3%) ( table 3 ). in france, 191 people have tested positive for sars-cov-2, with three deaths (mortality rate 1.6%).this study compared the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 in oecd countries (1.3%) with the mortality rate of common coronaviruses identified in ap-hm patients (0.8%) from 1 january 2013 to 2 march 2020. chi-squared test was performed, and the p -value was 0.11 (not significant).this study found that the mortality rate of common coronavirus infections is 0.8% in france. in comparison, the mortality rate of sars-cov-2 in european or american developed countries of a comparable economic level is 1.3% ( table 3 ). if the extrapolation of deaths in ap-hm hospitals is correct, in metropolitan france, this would represent 543/0.8 * 100 = 67 875 cases of patients hospitalized with a respiratory infection with common coronaviruses in 2 months, which is almost as many cases as for sars-cov-2 worldwide. in fact, mortality from respiratory infections is extremely dependent on the quality of care and access to care, and [27] . there is little chance that the emergence of sars-cov-2 could change this statistic significantly. fear could have a larger impact than the virus itself; a case of suicide motivated by the fear of sars-cov-2 has been reported in india [28] .in addition, coronaviruses that have rarely been tested systematically around the world may persist in the pharynx of asymptomatic people, representing a potential source of population immunity [29] . furthermore, it should be noted that systematic studies of other coronaviruses (but not yet for sars-cov-2) have found that the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is equal to or even higher than the percentage of symptomatic patients. the same data for sars-cov-2 may soon be available, which will further reduce the relative risk associated with this specific pathology.funding: this work was supported by the french government under the 'investments for the future' programme managed by the national agency for research, méditerranée-infection 10-iahu-03.ethical approval: not applicable. testing of repatriates was approved by the ethical board of the committee for the protection of persons (cpp ile de france vi, 6 february 2020).the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has once again aroused people's concern about coronavirus. seven human coronaviruses (hcovs) have been discovered so far, including hcov-229e, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, hcov-hku115, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. existing studies show that the cardiovascular disease increased the incidence and severity of coronavirus infection. at the same time, myocardial injury caused by coronavirus infection is one of the main factors contributing to poor prognosis. in this review, the recent clinical findings about the relationship between coronaviruses and cardiovascular diseases and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. this review aimed to provide assistance for the prevention and treatment of covid-19.advances in the relationship between coronavirus infection and cardiovascular diseases.hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 [35] were discovered in the 1960s, and hcov-nl63 [22] and hcov-hku1 [26] were later discovered in upper respiratory tract infections, asthma, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. there is evidence showing that infant, elderly and immunocompromised patients are more likely to be infected with high mortality rates [37, [62] [63] [64] . these infected patients are more likely develop severe disease states [65] [66] [67] [68] .varghese et al. [37] retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 261 children with hcov infection (including 229e, hku1, nl63, oc43) andfound that approximately 16.5% of the children had cardiovascular disease. hcov-infected children with cardiovascular disease are more likely to receive respiratory support and enter a pediatric intensive care unit (picu), suggesting that the underlying cardiovascular disease increased the severity of hcov infection in the children. cabeça et al. found that children with heart disease are more likely to be infected by hcovs [69] . the presence of congenital heart disease was a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus infection in children who were less than five years old [70] ( table 1) .hypotension was found in a small number of patients with these four hcov infections [70] (table 2 ). there is no relevant evidence showing that hcov infection can cause heart injury. however, kim et al. reported that hcovs were detected in children with kawasaki disease, which is characterized by acute systemic vasculitis in childhood and may induce severe cardiovascular complications [71] . serological tests suggest that hcov-229e may be involved in the occurrence of kawasaki disease [72] . therefore, we still need to pay attention to cardiovascular complications when facing these four kinds of hcov infection.the severe acute respiratory syndrome [27] that broke out globally in 2003 is different from the human coronavirus described previously. it is a severe acute respiratory infection with clinical manifestations of fever and dry cough, with the lungs as the main locations of lesions. some patients quickly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and multiple organ failure with high mortality [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] .there is much relevant evidence showing that pre-existing comorbid conditions are one of the major determinants of fatality [76, [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . it has been reported that the presence of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and heart disease, is associated with adverse outcomes and mortality in sars patients [84] [85] [86] [87] . wong et al. reviewed the medical records of fatal cases and found that 60% of the patients who died had comorbid conditions such as hypertension and coronary artery disease [88] . chen et al. found that patients with combined hypertension and cerebrovascular diseases are more likely to develop ards [89] . another study by hu et al. showed that the incidence rates of critical conditions and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mods ) among sars patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were 1.8-fold and 1.9-fold higher than those of patients without underlying disease, suggesting that cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are major risk factors for sars patients to devolve into critical conditions and mods and eventually lead to death [90] (table 1) .regarding the cardiovascular complications of sars patients, it was found that sars patients had subclinical diastolic impairment without contraction involvement, and this damage may be reversible upon clinical recovery [91] . another study by yu et al. found that cardiovascular complications, including hypotension and tachycardia, are common in sars patients but are usually self-limiting. bradycardia and cardiac hypertrophy were less common, and arrhythmias were rare [92] . acute myocardial infarction can also be seen in a few sars patients [93] . sars-cov was reported to be found in 40% (7/18 patients) of heart samples from patients who died of sars during the toronto outbreak [76] , which might explain the myocardial damage discovered in sars patients [89] . there are reports indicating that sars-cov also attacks small blood j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f cardiovascular disease increased the mortality of mers [108] . banik suggested that sufficient attention should be paid to mers patients with combined underlying diseases to reduce the occurrence of serious complications and mortality [109] (table 1) .heart damage was also reported in mers patients [110] . mers-cov was found in the kidneys of deceased patients but was not detected in the heart tissue, and the heart showed no significant histological changes [111, 112] . however, an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue, implying direct cardiac pathology [113] . the mechanism of heart injury in mers infection remains unclear and requires more research.covid-19, which broke out at the end of 2019, is a disease caused by infection with sars-cov-2 [1, 2, 4] . similar to sars-cov and mers-cov, sars-cov-2 is a β-cov [2] . covid-19 is similar to sars and mers and manifests as extensively pathological viral lung inflammation [1] .although similar to sars-cov and mers-cov, sars-cov-2 has its own characteristics [1, 114] . early cases suggest that covid-19 may not be as severe as sars and mers. however, the rapidly increasing number of cases and increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission suggest that sars-cov-2 is more contagious than sars-cov and mers-cov and has a lower fatality [3, 9, [115] [116] [117] . up to april 27, 2020, the overall mortality of covid-19 was 6.9% globally [5] . but the fatality rate is different in different regions and times, ranging from 0.7% to 13.5% [5, 118] .the symptoms of covid-19 infection appear after an incubation period of approximately 6.4 days [119] . fever, fatigue, and dry cough are the main manifestations of covid-19, and a few patients have symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and diarrhea [2, 9, 120, 121] . patients with severe cases often experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after onset [122] . severe cases of covid-19 progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis, which is difficult to correct, and coagulopathy [10] .current case reports show that sars-cov-2 infection may have cardiovascular symptoms in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms. a small number of patients have atypical clinical manifestations and may start with cardiovascular symptoms such as chest tightness, palpitations and chest pain. a study by liu et al. found that 7.3% (10/137) of patients had palpitations as the first symptom [123] . it was also reported that 2% of patients experienced chest pain during hospitalization [11] . in addition, wang et al. found that 16.7% of patients with covid-19 had arrhythmias [10] .according to relevant studies [9] [10] [11] 124] , the proportion of covid-19 patients with comorbid cvds, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, was larger than that of patients with other comorbidities or without comorbidities, suggesting that patients with cvd may be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection. moreover, the incidence of cvd in patients with severe or fatal cases with covid-19 was higher than that in patients with nonsevere cases or in those who survived [12, 13, 124] . according to the reports of the chinese center for disease control and prevention, 15.7% of the deaths were hypertension, and 9% had other cardiovascular diseases, further suggesting that underlying cardiovascular diseases may be one of the important risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with covid-19 [8] . it can be seen not only that the number of covid-19 patients with cardiovascular disease is large but also that these patients have poor tolerance to severe pneumonia and are more likely to develop severe cases (table 1) .cardiac complications such as electrocardiography abnormities, diastolic dysfunction, and acute myocardial injury were reported in patients with covid-19 [124] [125] [126] [127] . cases of severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function have been reported after covid-19 [128] [129] [130] . and sars-cov-2 infection-related myocarditis is likely associated with myocardial injury [60, 128] . according to the study by li et al., the most common organ damage outside the lungs was heart injury[13]. serum myocardial necrosis markers such as hypersensitive troponin i (hs-tni) and creatine kinase (ck) increased to varying degrees in patients with mild and severe cases of covid-19 [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [131] [132] [133] [134] . however, the risk of heart injury was higher in patients with severe cases, approximately 22.2% to 31% [9, 12, 126, 133, 134] , than in patients with mild cases, approximately 2% to 4% [9, 10] . the percentage of heart injury in covid-19 patients who died, approximately 28% to 89% [12, 13, 132] , was higher than that in those who survived. n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp) levels were also reported to be increased[13, 134, 135] . increased hs-tni and probnp expression levels may be risk factors for severe illness and high mortality of covid-19 [133] [134] [135] . furthermore, it was found that high hs-tni levels were associated with increased levels of inflammation (neutrophils, il-6, crp, and pct) and decreased levels of immunity (lymphocytes, monocytes, and cd4+ and cd8+ t cells), suggesting that cardiac injury may have something to do with the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response [131, 132] (table 2) .two recent studies published in jama cardiology reported the cardiovascular complications of covid-19 in detail [60, 136] . shi et al. found that cardiac injury was a common condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19 in wuhan, china, and it is associated with higher risk of inhospital mortality [136] . guo et al. reported that myocardial injury was significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19. myocardial injury was associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury [60] (table 2 ).j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f covid-19 may induce new cardiovascular diseases and / or aggravate potential cardiovascular diseases. the short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects of covid-19 and the effects of specific treatments are unclear and need further investigation.as the epidemic spread, sars-cov-2 evolved multiple subtypes. in a recent study, researchers proposed the subdivision of the global sars-cov-2 population into sixteen well-defined subtypes by focusing on the widely shared polymorphisms in nonstructural (nsp3, nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13 and nsp14) cistrons, structural (spike and nucleocapsid) and accessory (orf8) genes [137] . six virus subtypes were predominant in the population, accounting for more than 97% of the samples isolated from around the world. and the subtypes showed some geographical structure with two clusters: a smaller one comprised of isolates mostly sampled from western hemisphere (subtypes ii, vi, ix, x and xi) and a larger one whose isolates were sampled from western and eastern hemispheres (subtypes i, iii, iv, v, vii, viii, xii, xiii, xiv, xv and xvi) [137] . the researchers believed that the genetic structure determined for the sars-cov-2 population provides substantial guidelines for maximizing the effectiveness of trials for testing the candidate vaccines or drugs [137] .in another earlier study, population genetic analyses of 103 sars-cov-2 genomes indicated that these viruses evolved into two major types (designated l and s), that are well defined by two different single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) [138] . the l type (~70%) is more prevalent than the s type (~30%), but the s type was found to be the ancestral version. the l type is more aggressive and spread more quickly. and it was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in wuhan. but the frequency of the l type decreased after early january 2020 for more severe j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f selective pressure placed by human intervention on the l type [138] . contrary to the l type, the s-type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to the weaker selective pressure [138] .it was also reported that among the 27 viruses isolated from wuhan, 26 (96.3%) were l type, and only 1 (3.7%) was s type [138] . however, among the other 73 viruses isolated outside wuhan, 45 (61.6%) were l type, and 28 (38.4%) were s type [138] . this comparison suggests that the l type was significantly more prevalent in wuhan than in other places. and recent studies about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with covid-19 in wuhan [9] [10] [11] 139] or outside wuhan [134, 140, 141] have showed that the mortality of covid-19 patients and the proportion of patients with cardiac injury outside wuhan was lower than that in wuhan (table 3) . although there were many reasons for the different incidence of cardiac injury and outcome of covid-19 in and outside wuhan, such as the shortage of medical resources in wuhan, the role of different sars-cov-2 subtypes cannot be ignored. the relationship between sars-cov-2 subtypes and the mortality of covid-19 or the cvd complications need for further immediate, comprehensive studies that combine genomic data, epidemiological data, and records of the clinical symptoms of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.according to the references above, we can see that patients with underlying cvd may be more likely to become infected with coronavirus, and cvd may be one of the risk factors for poor prognosis and high mortality of cov infection. few studies, however, have explored the mechanisms underlying these associations. we believe that the possible mechanisms may be related to inflammation.cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease are all metabolic-related diseases. it has been reported that metabolic syndrome can downregulate the key mediator of the host's innate immune response to pathogenesis, affecting the function of the innate and humoral immune systems [142] . chronic low-grade inflammatory disease has been widely recognized as a feature of coronary heart disease, and its occurrence is closely related to inflammation [143] . the occurrence of hypertension is associated with oxidative stress, inflammation and the activation of the immune system [144] . il-6, il-1 and tumor necrosis factor α (tnf-α) levels are higher in patients with hypertension than in patients with normal blood pressure [145] . this may explain why patients with underlying cardiovascular disease found in the clinic are more susceptible to infection.kulcsar et al. showed that mers-cov infection can lead to prolonged respiratory tract inflammation, immune cell dysfunction, and changes in the expression profile of inflammatory mediators [146] . lymphopenia and increased inflammatory mediators were found in sars-cov-2 infection [147] . immune disorders caused by sars-cov infection have also been reported [148] . these may lead to the exacerbation of the original cardiovascular disease, which is related to the death of some patients found in the clinic due to heart failure [88, 103, 132] . according to information released by the shanghai municipal health and family planning commission, the first covid-19 death in shanghai was in an individual who was 88 years old with a severe history of hypertension and cardiac insufficiency. an analysis of the cause of death suggested that the patient died of heart failure and systemic multiple organ dysfunction. therefore, sars-cov-2 infection was just an inducement for exacerbations [124] .overall, the heart and lungs are inseparable in the normal physiological functions of the human body. on the one hand, comorbidities and complications of the heart increase the risk of pneumonia infection and exacerbation; on the other hand, pneumonia infection may aggravate existing cardiovascular diseases, such as increased blood pressure, increased heart failure, and the recurrence of myocardial infarction.fever is a common symptom in patients with coronavirus infection [9, 27, 149] . fever promotes the immune functions of humans and some animals and decreases the pathogenicity of some microbes. antibody production, t-cell activation, neutrophil function, and macrophage oxidative metabolism have been reported to increase in the presence of fever [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] . however, to avoid excessively elevated body temperature affecting normal physiological functions, the body will activate sympathetic nerves and regulate circulatory function, which will increase the heart rate and cardiac output [155] . an increase in heart rate over a long period of time will lead to increased myocardial oxygen consumption and decreased cardiac output, which may cause ischemia or heart failure [156] . many diseases with fever symptoms may be complicated by myocarditis, such as spotted fever rickettsioses infection [157] , severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [158] , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [159] , dengue [160] [161] [162] , complicated scrub typhus [163] , herpes simplex virus infection [164] , enteric fever [165] .a decrease in cardiac function may occur in febrile illnesses, but whether myocardial damage is due to fever or the underlying infection is not known [166] . weissinger et al. found that in pigs with a bacterial infection with elevated body temperature, serum ck, lactate dehydrogenase (ld), j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f and gamma-globulin (gg) levels were increased. the administration of antibiotics to these pigs and lowering their body temperature reduced ck and ld levels, but gg levels remained elevated, suggesting that the infection did not decrease. this study indicated that the levels of ck and ld were elevated due to fever caused by infection [167] . k l et al. discovered that a longer duration of fever was related to the occurrence of pericarditis after myocardial infarction [168] . therefore, heart injury in coronavirus infection may be related to fever .severe pneumonia can cause significant gas exchange disturbances and lead to hypoxemia. hypoxia reduces the energy production required for cell metabolism and increases the body's anaerobic digestion. acidosis and oxygen free radicals accumulated in the cell destroy the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane. as hypoxia continues, the intracellular calcium ion concentration increases significantly, leading to a series of cell damage processes, including apoptosis [169] . at the same time, hypoxia can also induce inflammatory reactions, such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the release of cytokines, leading to further tissue ischemia, and may even cause myocardial infarction[13, 170, 171] .previous lessons from coronavirus and influenza have shown that viral infections can cause acute coronary syndrome [172, 173] , arrhythmia [174] , and exacerbation of heart failure [175] , mainly due to a combination of significant systemic inflammation response and localized vascular inflammation at the arterial plaque, along with other effects [176] [177] [178] . evidence has shown that sars-cov induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (mcp-1), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta1), tnf, il-1 and il-j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 6 and interferon-β (ifn-β) in sars patients and experimental animal models infected with sars-cov [179, 180] . tnf and il-1 family and il-6 family cytokines are considered proinflammatory mediators of heart failure, and they have obvious negative inotropic effects, which may explain heart failure complications in sars infection [181] . the acute heart injury might be due to the cytokine storm resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars infection [30] . there is evidence indicating that myocardial inflammation induced by sars-cov is mainly mediated by macrophages and the resultant production of chemokines [95, 96] . the nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) signaling pathway associated with the induction of proinflammatory cytokines is activated in sars-cov-infected mice. treatment with drugs that inhibited nf-κb activation led to a reduction in inflammation in both sars-cov-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after sars-cov infection, indicating that the activation of the nf-κb signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after sars-cov infection and that nf-κb inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by sars-cov and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses [182] .sars-cov-2 appears to affect themyocardium and cause myocarditis [128] . myocardial injury is likely associated with infection-related myocarditis and/or ischemia [60] . increases in inflammatory factors such as crp, il-1 and il-6 were also discovered in sars-cov-2 infection [131, 132, 147] . wu et al. believed that sars-cov-2 may cause heart damage by the cytokine storm [131] . evidence has shown that sars-cov-2 may mainly affect t lymphocytes, especially cd4+ t cells, resulting in a significant decrease in lymphocyte numbers [183] . the extent of lymphopenia and an increase in inflammatory cytokines are related to the severity of the disease [147] . critically ill covid-19 patients had higher levels of il6, il10, tnfα, lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and c-reactive protein than patients with mild covid-19 [9, 139, 184] , suggesting that inflammatory indicators are an important factor in the early diagnosis of severe covid-19.most patients with coronavirus infection are in an inflammatory state, which places the patients in a hypercoagulable state. for example, covid-19 leads to an increase in d-dimer levels in 40% of patients, a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) in 16% of patients, and a decrease in pt in 30% of patients, further increasing the risk of embolism [11] . hypercoagulability induced by inflammation might contribute to plaque rupture, with subsequent thrombosis and myocardial injury [185] . therefore, clinicians should pay attention to covid-19 patients with coronary heart disease to prevent myocardial injury and myocardial infarction .septic shock can be seen as a serious complication in sars, mers and covid-19[13, 76, 103] . approximately 6.2% of sars-cov-2 infections are complicated by shock [126] . it was reported that left ventricular dysfunction occurs in approximately 20% of patients within 6 hours after the onset of septic shock, and the incidence can increase to 60% by 1 to 3 days after the onset of septic shock [186] . myocardial dysfunction and cardiovascular inflammation might lead to elevated creatine kinase and troponin [187] , which might explain the high hs-tni in deceased patients .in addition to the abovementioned accompanying symptoms, anxiety and stress can also lead to adverse reactions such as accelerated heart rhythms and elevated blood pressure, especially in critically ill patients [188, 189] . health anxiety could be found in coronavirus-infected patients [190] .generally, everyone experiences health anxiety to some degree, and the associated vigilance to a potential health-related threat can be protective.however, excessive health anxiety can be detrimental [190] . the literature indicates that stress can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f and sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in peripheral glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels [191] . high plasma catecholamine levels are associated with an increased risk of heart failure. altered autonomic activity during depression can lead to arrhythmias. the activated sns alters cardiac wall contractility and increases apoptotic pathways in cardiomyocytes, contributing to cvd development .although there is no relevant study on covid-19 patients suffering from anxiety, medical workers have been reported to be anxious after direct contact with the patients [192, 193] . a study by sun et al. showed that some chinese showed acute posttraumatic stress symptoms during the covid-19 outbreak [194] . therefore, psychological counseling should be conducted on patients in a timely manner, and anxiolytic drugs could be used when necessary .as mentioned above, sars-cov was reported to lead to myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ace2 expression, which may be responsible for myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with sars [99] . direct sars-cov infection of cardiomyocytes may also lead to myocarditis and impaired myocardial function. coronavirus-induced myocarditis and its subsequent progression to dilated cardiomyopathy have been described in rabbit models [195] . sars-cov was found in heart samples from patients who died of sars [76] .pathological findings showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration in patients with sars-cov in the heart, with evidence of myocardial damage. mers-cov was not detected in the heart tissue, and the heart showed no significant histological changes in mers patients [111, 112] .however, an animal model study clearly stated that mers-cov rna could be seen in cardiac tissue, implying direct cardiac pathology [113] .although myocarditis was reported in sporadic autopsy cases [128] , there is still no clear pathological evidence supporting that sars-cov-2 can directly cause heart damage .the most frequently used drugs during hospitalization are glucocorticoids and antiviral drugs, as well as antibiotics. the secondary qt interval prolongation caused by the use of drugs during hospitalization cannot be ignored. antiviral drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir), antibiotics (azithromycin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin), antifungal drugs, glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs, there is a potential risk of prolonging the qtc interval [196, 197] . drug-associated qt prolongation is associated with increased arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic mortality and it therefore continues to be an important metric of drug safety [198] .a small study in france enrolling 26 treated patients and 16 non-randomized controls showed that hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin shortened the time to resolution of viral shedding of covid-19 [199] . based on this study, clinicians in many countries have begun using these medications in clinical practice, and multiple randomized trials are being initiated. but there were occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging the qt interval and provoking torsade de pointes when used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus [200] [201] [202] [203] . the widely used antibiotic azithromycin was gradually recognized as a rare cause of prolonged qt, severe arrhythmia, and increased risk of sudden death [204] [205] [206] [207] . although there were no reports of arrhythmia death caused by the use of hydroxychloroquine, the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should also be noted [208] .j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o factive support with expected management based on early prognostic indicators may improve recovery. appropriate treatment of heart failure, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis are still important. with continued global cooperation on multiple methods, specific evidence-based treatment strategies for covid-19 will emerge. in order to protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccines will be needed to make a history of covid-19. and some treatment related issues need attention.firstly, the use of acei / arb drugs was controversial in the earlier phase of covid-19 epidemic. but recently published studies suggested that there is no need for patients with hypertension to stop using acei / arb or switch to other antihypertensive medicine [60, 61, 209] . some conjectures [210] based on the disease mechanism in the early stage of the outbreak that acei / arb may increase the infection of new coronavirus and the aggravation of covid-19 by increasing the expression of ace2 have been denied by more and more clinical evidence. we see that the continuous treatment of covid-19 patients with hypertension with acei / arb will not only cause the deterioration of the condition, but also continue to exert cardiovascular protection and even improve the prognosis [60, 61, 209] .secondly, we should pay attention to the application of hydroxychloroquine [200] [201] [202] [203] and azithromycin [204] [205] [206] [207] for their side effects of prolonging the qt interval. other drugs used to treat the covid-19 patients, such as antiviral drugs (lopinavir, ritonavir), antibiotics (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin), antifungal drugs, glucocorticoids and some antiarrhythmic drugs, can cause the qt interval prolongation and should attract more attention. reference by sapp et al. would help to minimize risk of drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia during treatment of covid-19 [211] .thirdly, a recent study from jama reported that the mortality rate of patients with mechanical ventilation treatment was 88.1% [212] . multiple studies around the world have shown that the mortality rate of covid-19 patients using ventilator was still high [213] [214] [215] . and it was believed that the ventilator should be used more cautiously in patients with covid-19, which can reduce the mortality of patients using the ventilator by more than 50% [216] . new guidelines should be established for when to use a ventilator for patients with covid-19. we advocate the application of staged breathing support methods to delay the use of ventilator. simple oxygen treatment like nasal oxygen supply may be safer and more effective.fourth, methylprednisolone are the classical immunosuppressive drugs, which are important to stop or delay the progress of the pneumonia, and have been proved to be effective for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). in recent study [217] , wu at al. found that the administration of methylprednisolone appeared to reduce the risk of death in covid-19 patients with ards. however, of those who received methylprednisolone treatment, 23 of 50 patients died. this is a rather high mortality of ~50%. the indication, timing, dosage and duration, the application of methylprednisolone needs further investigation.fifth, the early report showed that remdesivir was highly effective in the control of sars-cov-2 infection in vitro [218] . but recent study published in lancet showed that remdesivir did not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients [219] . however, another clinical trial showed that remdesivir accelerates recovery from advanced covid-19 [220] . another clinical trial showed that there was no significant difference in clinical outcome between the 5-day and 10-day course of remdesivir [221] . these data suggested remdesivir does not reduce the mortality of covid-19 patients, j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f but have an effect on shortening the course of disease in mild patients. and early medication may be better. the application of remdesivir needs further researches.clinical data indicate that comorbid cardiovascular disease will aggravate the severity of coronavirus infection, leading to a poor prognosis.coronavirus may cause myocardial injury, and the prognosis of patients with complicated myocardial injury is poor. the mechanism of coronavirus causing myocardial injury and drug treatment options remain to be further studied.the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f abbreviation: ck, creatine kinase; ldh, lactate dehydrogenase; hs-tni, hypersensitive troponin i; ckmb, creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme; probnp, pro brain natriuretic peptide; crp, c-reactive protein; il, interleukin; tnt, troponin t. 6 (3.6%) 9 (6.7%) death 6 (15%) 11 (11%) 5 (7.5%) 6 (4.3%) 1 (0.3%) 2 (1.2%) 1 (0.7%)we assessed weekly mortality from all causes during the year 2020, up to the epidemiological week 17, compared with the previous year. the data were obtained through the national civil registry information center (cnirc, acronym in portuguese). we estimate the expected mortality and the 95% confidence interval by projecting the observed mortality in 2019 for the population of 2020.in the five capitals with the highest incidences it was possible to identify excess deaths in the pandemic period, the age group most affected were those over 60 years old, 31% of the excess deaths occurred in the population between 20 and 59 years old. there was a strong correlation (r = 0.94) between the excess of deaths in each city and the number of deaths confirmed by epidemiological surveillance. there was no excess of deaths in the capital with the lowest incidence, nor among the population under 20 years old. we estimate that epidemiological surveillance managed to capture only 52% of all mortality associated with the covid-19 pandemic in the cities studied.considering the simplicity of the method, its low cost and reliability for assessing the real burden of the disease, we believe that the assessment of excess mortality associated with the covid-19 pandemic should be widely used as a complementary tool to regular epidemiological surveillance and its use should be encouraged by who.in december 2019, an increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia of unknown etiology was observed in wuhan, hubei, china. initially the disease was associated with exposure in a seafood and wild animal market, but then transmission from person to person was confirmed. on january 7, 2020 a new coronavirus was isolated and identified as the cause of the pneumonia outbreak, january 13 was confirmed the first case in thailand, on january 19, 2020 the first case was confirmed in korea, two cases in beijing and one case in guangdong (china) [1] . on february 11, the world health organization (who) announced the name of coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19), having as main symptoms in the acute phase of the disease fever, cough, myalgia and dyspnea. on the same day, the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ictv) named this new coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). who technical visit carried out between 16 and 24 february estimated the r0 basic number of reproduction cases of the then new coronavirus initially between 2-2.5 [2] . even before who recognized that the occurrence of the coronavirus was a pandemic (march 11), the virus had already spread to many countries. by the end of april, more than 3.6 million cases and 251.5 thousand deaths had been registered on the five continents. [2] . in brazil, the first case of covid-19 was confirmed on february 26, 2020. after 15 days, sustained transmission was declared and on march 17, the first death was confirmed. by the end of april 2020, more than 110 thousand cases and 5,000 deaths had been confirmed, with a mortality coefficient of 20 deaths per 1 million inhabitants, with brazil among the 10 countries with the highest number of deaths. [3] .despite the high number of confirmed cases and deaths in brazil to date, and efforts to diagnose suspected cases, it is believed that testing is far from necessary. the covid-19 testing laboratory network was established gradually, first centralized in three units of national influenza center (nic) and later included private laboratories and the state public health laboratory network [4] . the who recommendation on march 16, of mass testing for covid-19 resulted in a shortage of tests on a worldwide scale that, added to the increase in cases in the country, compromised the testing capacity in brazil, not only in the public network, but also in the private health network [4] , this may be contributing to the underestimation of the real magnitude of the disease in the country, the same may be happening worldwide.the broad clinical spectrum of the disease, which can hinder clinical diagnosis, added to the scarcity of laboratory resources and the overload of the health care network, will not allow epidemiological surveillance systems to detect all cases and deaths. a reliable assessment of the burden of covid-19 is essential so that health managers and country governments can better decide on the magnitude and duration of non-pharmacological interventions to control the disease. the objective of this study was to analyze the excess of deaths and the mortality coefficient due to the current sars-cov-2 pandemic, in the capitals with the highest number of cases recorded in routine surveillance systems, in brazil.this is a study based on official public data in which we analyzed the time series, cases, deaths due to infection by covid-19 and the excess of deaths in the first months of the pandemic in six brazilian capitals.for the present study, the five brazilian capitals with the highest absolute numbers of confirmed cases of covid-19, fortaleza, são paulo, rio de janeiro, manaus and recife were selected (figure -1) . to validate the method, the capital porto alegre was also studied, which has one of the lowest incidence rates of covid-19 and which recently conducted a serological survey proving a low seroprevalence rate. [5] mortality data were collected on the website of the national civil registry information center (cnirc, acronym in portuguese) [6] , that made available information on deaths registered in notary offices across the country in the years 2019 and 2020. in brazil, notary offices have a legal period of 14 days to enter the data contained in death certificates signed by the attending physician in the cnirc. deaths due to covid-19, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, septicemia, undetermined causes and other deaths were included in the analysis, the criteria used are presented in annex i. deaths from external causes were excluded. in brazilian law, the definition of the cause of death in the death certificate is preferably made by the attending physician and there is no obligation for the diagnostic hypothesis to have laboratory confirmation. therefore, we group deaths as respiratory causes (covid-19, pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome) and all causes (including previous and more septicemia, other deaths and undetermined causes).data from confirmed cases and deaths by covid-19 were collected in the repository of the brazil project, which performs the extraction from official sources following a preestablished pattern [7] deaths are classified according to the date of confirmation of the case in the notification system for notifiable diseases (sinan acronym in portuguese) and are available for wide consultation [8] .to obtain the covid-19 mortality data confirmed in sinan we search the death dates directly in the databases and reports of the state and municipal health secretariats [9] [10] [11] . it was not possible to obtain data by symptom onset date for the municipalities of rio de janeiro and manaus. in order to make it possible to compare the temporal quality of the information, all data were obtained on the same day (may 2, 2020).demographic data were collected on the brazilian institute of geography and statistics (ibge, acronym in portuguese) website, which estimates the population of brazilian capitals by age group on a quarterly basis through the continuous national household sample survey (pnadc, acronym in portuguese) [12] . for the first quarter of 2019 the estimated population for the last quarter of 2018 was used and for 2020 the estimated population for the last quarter of 2019 was used..

mortality for 2020 and the 95% confidence interval, projecting the 2019 mortality rate for the 2020 population.the period with excess mortality was defined as starting in the first sequence of two consecutive weeks with a death toll above the upper limit of 95% confidence interval and ending in the first of two consecutive weeks with a death toll below this limit [13] .as the mortality data can be entered up to 14 days after death, we evaluated the correlation between the cases officially confirmed by the health departments and the excess of deaths until the epidemiological week 16, then we constructed a linear regression.the mortality rate by age group was calculated for the period with excess mortality. the expected number of deaths by age group was calculated by projecting the 2019 death rate by age group for the 2020 population. excess mortality by age group was calculated as the number of deaths observed minus the expected number of deaths. the ratio of mortality rates was calculated by dividing the mortality rate by age group in 2020 during the period with excess mortality, by the mortality rate observed in 2019.statistical analyzes were performed using the stata 9.2 program and the results presented in graphs and tables built in the microsoft® excel® program.. table 1 shows the population and the epidemiological situation of the cities studied. we also present an excess of deaths from all causes during the period classified as excess mortality. we can observe different incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants, the lowest being 3.3 in porto alegre and the highest 229.2 in recife. the case fatality rate varied between 3.3% in porto alegre, the highest rate was manaus, 10.2%. figure 2 shows that, with the exception of porto alegre, in the 5 cities with the highest incidence of covid-19, excess mortality was identified. in the cities of são paulo and rio de janeiro there was an increase above 95% of the confidence interval in general mortality from the epidemiological week 11 when compared to the previous year. in these cities, the first cases confirmed by laboratory diagnosis occurred respectively in epidemiological weeks 12 and 13. these findings suggest that there may have been underreporting of cases and deaths by covid-19 for epidemiological surveillance, but that it can be identified by the syndromic surveillance of excess deaths. in the cities of recife, fortaleza and manaus the excess of deaths can be identified from week 14. in manaus, the risk of dying in se 17 from respiratory disease was 11 times greater than in the same period of the previous year, considering all causes of deaths the increase was 4 times. assuming that week 17 probably still does not include all deaths, these numbers are expected to be even higher. in figure 3 -a we can see the strong pearson correlation (r = 0.95) between the number of confirmed deaths in sinan and the excess of deaths up to epidemiological week 16, in the six cities studied. the slope of the regression suggests that there was an excess of deaths 2.5 times greater than the official number of deaths reported in week 16 (r²=0.91; p<0.0001).. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international

the date of death (são paulo, fortaleza and recife), we can verify that the mortality confirmed by covid-19 corresponds to 52% of all excess deaths. table 2 shows the mortality rate by age group for all causes. it is possible to verify that the age group most affected was over 60 years old with 3,801 excess deaths from all causes. there was also an excess of deaths in the population aged between 20 and 59 years representing 31% of the total excess mortality from all causes (1,679 deaths).we observed that there was an excess of 5,350 deaths from all causes during the first weeks of the epidemic in the 5 brazilian cities most affected by covid-19. this increase was greater in cities with higher incidences, 31% of this excess of deaths occurred in the population between 20 and 59 years old. these findings are compatible with what has been observed in clinical studies and in the bulletins of brazilian epidemiological surveillance. there was no excess of deaths among children under 20 years of age, nor an increase in overall mortality in the city of porto alegre, where the incidence of covid-19, until the moment of the analysis, was lower. these aspects reinforce the consistency of these findings.the number of deaths that occurred until the epidemiological week 16 confirmed by the official epidemiological surveillance system corresponded to 52% of the excess deaths that occurred in the same period. considering that the data were collected 14 days after the end of week 16, we believe that almost all investigations of deaths should have been closed. therefore, we can estimate that the epidemiological surveillance system only 52% of the total mortality burden of this disease. this is not an unexpected finding, since other viruses such as influenza and chikungunya are also characterized by a mortality burden that is often greater than that measured through the etiological investigation of each patient. mortality associated with these viruses can be better assessed by calculating the excess mortality that occurs in periods of epidemic [13, 14] . using a similar methodology, it is possible to estimate that in new york city the excess of deaths in the first four weeks was 12547 and, however, conventional epidemiological surveillance was able to identify 7186 deaths from covid-19, 57% of the excess deaths in the same period [15] . in portugal the excess of mortality that occurred between march 1 and april 22 was 3 to 5 times higher than that explained by the deaths reported by covid-19 officially reported [16] . this underestimation of mortality through surveillance systems can occur as a result of several factors, part of which is explained by failure to report, another part of the difficulty in identifying cases that present in atypical ways and the late complications of the disease. the underestimation of mortality by surveillance systems can occur as a result of several associated factors, part of which is explained by failure in the notification or laboratory investigation of patients who would have a case definition criterion, another part is a consequence of the difficulty in identifying the cases that present atypical clinical forms or deaths from late complications of the disease. in fact, a still unknown proportion of patients with covid-19 have serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular complications such as acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock, these cases may not be identified by attending physicians in routine situations.

preprint this version posted may 12, 2020. .all-cause mortality exceeded the upper limit of the confidence interval (95%) a week before the first laboratory-confirmed death in the cities of são paulo and rio de janeiro, this suggests that there should already be many deaths that would not have been captured by conventional epidemiological surveillance system, based on individual notification of cases. covid-19 is characterized by a majority of mild cases that can be confused clinically with influenza, or even with respiratory syncytial virus that occurs at this time of year in these two brazilian cities [18] . therefore, it is plausible to believe that sars-cov-2 has circulated widely and this circulation was not identified at the beginning of the brazilian epidemic. as patients with covid-19 worsen around the 10th day of symptom and death often occurs 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms, there may have been an important transmission even before the first case was identified. the county of santa clara medical examiner-coroner identified sars-cov-2 at the autopsy of a patient who died at home because of an unknown cause on february 6 with no history of travel abroad. the first case of community transmission in the usa was identified by regular epidemiological surveillance on february 26 [19] . during the 2009 influenza pandemic in the state of são paulo, it was possible to identify that mortality from respiratory diseases in the population was already above the upper limit of 95% of the expected two weeks before confirmation of community viral circulation in the state [13] . these findings reinforce the sensitivity and usefulness of surveillance of excess deaths and other complementary strategies of traditional epidemiological surveillance based on the notification and investigation of suspected clinical cases.another relevant aspect was the fact that the excess of mortality until week 16 had a strong pearson correlation with official mortality (r = 0.94), this reinforces the consistency of the findings. the slope of the regression line indicates that the excess of deaths in the 6 cities was 2.5 times the number of deaths that were in the official surveillance system at the time. this demonstrates the potential of this type of surveillance in the opportunity to detect changes in the pattern of mortality, effectively and importantly complementing traditional epidemiological surveillance.the present study has some limitations, many of which are a consequence of the fact that the assessment is made at the moment when the epidemic is still in its beginning, so some data may still be incomplete. in addition, death records were obtained from the registry information system instead of the sim (mortality information system), which check the consistency of the diagnosis and follow the recommendations of the world health organization for the classification of the basic cause of death. . this choice was due to the fact that the sim takes at least 6 months to consolidate the information and free access for consultations. we emphasize that this limitation is restricted to the analysis of the excess of deaths from respiratory causes, since the cause of death does not interfere in the assessment of mortality from all causes. another limitation related to the use of data from the registry offices is that in this system only data are available for the years 2019 and 2020, therefore, it was not possible to use an average mortality rate of several years as would be the most appropriate [14, 15] . even with these limitations, the results were quite consistent, showing the most affected ages and there was a strong correlation between the mortality found in the official surveillance system and excess mortality, in addition, the period of increase in mortality was coincident with the pandemic. in addition, no excess deaths were identified in the city with a low incidence of covid-19.excess mortality is a tool already used to assess mortality associated with climatic events, earthquakes and epidemics with good temporal definition such as those caused by the influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and chikungunya [13, 14, 20] . like the . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 12, 2020. . cdc in the usa, the euromomo project tracks mortality data from some european countries weekly to assess excess mortality and monitor the impact of influenza epidemics, these systems are managing to capture the excess mortality associated with the covid-19 pandemic. that is ongoing [15, 21] . obtaining excess deaths, regardless of the cause recorded on death certificates, seems to be the best estimate of mortality during the pandemic [22] .we believe that surveillance aimed at excess mortality is a simple, low-cost, easy-toimplement tool that can collaborate a lot with traditional epidemiological surveillance, therefore, it should have its use expanded to other countries and encouraged by the world health organization. most countries already have mortality systems that could easily be adapted for this purpose. an important characteristic of this approach is that it does not depend on the flow of investigation of cases by health professionals, who are involved in preparedness and response activities during major epidemics. because it does not necessarily depend on laboratory research, surveillance of excess mortality can be very useful, especially in low-income countries. in addition, it does not depend on the initial clinical suspicion, being able to more sensibly identify all deaths associated with the occurrence of different atypical phenomena, as diverse as epidemics, extreme weather events or earthquakes. . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available

single -stranded and positive -sense rna viruses. among both sars-cov and mers-cov caused outbreaks affecting multiple countries, severe disease, and global threatening, for its widespread infectivity, rapid progress, high variance and mortality rate, and nonspecial treatment, somewhat the same as sars-cov-2 in wuhan, china 5 . as for treatments, currently there is no defined primary remedy, vaccination or prophylaxis. nowadays, treatments for such cases range from supportive treatment (including fluid balance, nutrition support, invasive ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressors, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, etc.) to antiviral treatment, or both [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . the specific antiviral treatments were interferons (ifn), ribavirin, lopinavir, and other related antiviral agents. clinically, the use of specific antivirals, especially the utility of ifns, is still under great debate, for its efficacy, safety, and treatment-related adverse effects.initial in vitro investigations demonstrated type i interferons (ifn-α, ifn-β) to inhibit replication of sars coronavirus (sars-cov) 11 . based on previous studies, morgenstern et al. investigated the combination effect of ifn-β and ribavirin to prevent sars-cov, and yield potential benefits of the ribavirin plus ifn-β for the treatment of sars 12 . illuminated by the possible antiviral treatment for sars, several in vitro studies determined a possible efficacious effect of ifn-α2b and ribavirin in the treatment of mers-cov infection 13, 14 . subsequently, the same investigators further examined the efficacy of these drugs in an animal study (macaques), 8 hours after they were inoculated with mers-cov with favorable outcomes 15 could make contributions to increase survival rate, improve oxygen saturation and associated with a more rapid resolution of pyrexia or radiographic lung opacities and respiratory improvements 17-21 , or even prophylaxis efficacy 22, 23 .a review of such anecdotal experiences is greatly needed for the more rational use of type i ifns for coronavirus. therefore, we conducted this updated systematic review and meta-analysis to recapitulate relevant studies to evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability and treatment-related outcomes of type i ifns for coronavirus infection in clinical practice, with expectation to provide more robust evidence whether ifns should be served as first-line agents for coronavirus infection, including the sars-cov-2.this study was performed in accordance with prisma (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) 24 . the systematic literature search of databases was conducted by two independent reviewers on february, 2020. these articles that contained relevant information on ifn and coronavirus were initially searched on pubmed, cochrane library, web of science database, science direct, wanfang data, and china national knowledge infrastructure (cnki), without time period, language, and region restriction. a mesh terms search and keywords search were combined. the references of the included studies and reviews were also manually searched. we used the following search terms using the boolean operators: #1 "interferon" or "ifn" or "antivir*" or "drug effect" or "drug ther*" or "combination drug ther*" and #2 "coronavirus" or "middle east respiratory syndrome: or "mers-cov" or "mers virus*" or "sars" or "severe acute respiratory syndrome" or "sars-cov"(1) clinical trials regarding type i ifn (ifn-α, ifn-β)

reviewed the electronically and manually retrieved articles. after screening the titles and abstracts, potentially relevant studies were selected, and a full-text review was performed. all disagreements were solved by discussion or, still unsolved, by a third supervisor.each included article was thoroughly reviewed, and the following baseline information were extracted (table 1) : first author, publication year, region, study type, participants, diagnostic method of coronavirus, data collection method, time from admission to treatment start, time from diagnosis to treatment start, primary endpoints, and treatment-related adverse effects. in addition, the study design, treatment plan (including ifn dosage, frequency and duration), main findings and conclusions were extracted in detail in table 2 . data on total mortality rate, 14-day survival, 28-day survival, 3-month survival, transferring rate to intensive care unit (icu), required intubation and mechanical ventilation, resolution of pyrexia, and respiratory improvement (days) were recorded for possible meta-analysis.for better understanding of severity and case mortality rate of coronavirus, we divided these patients into critically ill patients and mild ill patient. critically ill defined as coronavirus-infected patients with other severe comorbidities, respiratory distress or failure, directly or indirectly transferred to icu, needing intubation, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo), when admitted to primary treatment. mild ill patients defined as these real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) or other laboratory confirmed coronavirus infected asymptomatic or otherwise laboratory well patients.dichotomous variables were analyzed using review manager version 5.3 (cochrane collaboration, oxford, united kingdom) and the mantel-haenszel method.the crude ors and their 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated. for continuous variables, mean difference (md) with 95% ci was applied. the single-rate meta-analysis was performed using stata 15.0 software (stata corporation, college station, texas, usa), which assigned a weight to each study based on both withinstudy variance and between-study heterogeneity.heterogeneity of these manuscripts was tested using both the chi-square test (with a low p-value indicating high heterogeneity, and p-value ≥0.1 indicating low heterogeneity) and i 2 index statistics (0% indicating no inter-study heterogeneity) 25 .when i 2 was < 50%, the fixed effects model was applied; otherwise, the random effects model was applied 26 . in all analysis, p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.the initial database search yielded 1073articles ( figure 1 ). in addition, six articles were added by manual searching from retrieved study lists and relevant reviews, and two papers added by expert suggestion. after eliminating 161 duplicate articles, 920 titles and abstracts were screened. after comprehensively screening 38 full texts, only 15 studies complied with the eligibility criteria and were included at last. among these, three were rcts 18, 22 , one of which has not published yet 27 , four were retrospective cohort studies 6, 20, 28, 29 , four were case series 6, 19, 21, 23 , one prospective cohort study 30 , one open-label preliminary study 17 , one open-label prospective randomized study 31 , and one retrospective observational study 32 .turner et al. firstly explored whether the prophylactic recombinant ifns could decrease cov-229e catch rate or reduce the severity of coronavirus cold symptoms in 1986 in a well-design randomized placebo-control study 22 . they recruited absolutely healthy volunteers for participants. in their study, they found that the cold-catch rate, the mean nasal symptom score, the mean total symptom score, and the mean number of days with total symptom score ＞4 were much lower in ifns prophylaxis group than placebo group, all reached significant difference ( table 2) on account of insufficient data, inconsistent initial study design, and complexity of human bodies and case variance, statistical synthesizing was impossible regarding abovementioned parameters ( table 1) . as for total mortality rate, we investigated the variance between critically and mild ill patients. on the basis of our analysis, the mortality rate was 69.0% (95% confidence interval: 61.2%-76.8%, i 2 =71.1%) and 11 .2% (95% confidence interval: 1.9%-20.5%, i 2 =98.5%) in critically and mild ill coronavirus-infected patients. both presented high heterogeneity and the random effect model was used (figure 2 ).our study systematically investigated the application of type i interferons forhcovs infection in clinical practice. according to our review, ifns mainly acted a vital role in rapid resolution of lung abnormalities, respiratory improvements, better oxygen saturation, reduced needs for supplemental oxygen support, and less of an increase in creatine kinase level, which are indispensable for advanced life support and further increase survival. in the meantime, several adverse effects were detected, including drop in platelet, drop in hemoglobin, rise in lipase or bilirubin, and emergency of pancreatitis (only one critically ill case at terminal phage of disease), but these treatment-related outcomes couldn't rule out the effects of other agents like ribavirin, and still need further investigation 33 . these side effects were not life threating, and much easier to solve compared with respiratory distress, intractable hyoxemia, or rapid progress of renal or hepatic failure. the tolerability of type i ifns was acceptable, and no premature discontinuation of ifn secondary to adverse effects was found in all case.apart from remedy effect of ifn in coronavirus infection described above, we also found the prophylaxis efficacy of ifn in coronavirus infection 22, 23 , which increased and enhanced the utility of ifn in clinical practice.al-tawfiq et al. reported their experience of five critically ill patients that were all died of multi-organ failure after treatment of ifn plus ribavirin and concluded that combination antivirals may not contribute to mers-cov-infected patients 32 , as preclinical data suggested. in addition, vast majority of adverse effects were reported by them. we think this conclusion may be not objective. they included only critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities, all under mechanical ventilation and, most importantly, diagnosed late in admission. the mortality rate was significantly related with comorbidities, like chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypotension, elevated creatinine, anemia, etc., and age more than 50-year 20, 28 . what's more, severity of illness was the greatest predictor of reduced survival in the multivariate analysis 20 . as for adverse effects, this couldn't absolutely ascribe to ifn alone, critically ill patients may suffer from respiratory abnormality, internal environment disturbance, and other disease-related complications. beyond this, some side effects, at least drop in hemoglobin level, was found related with ribavirin, for its temporal toxicity 21, 33 .cheng et al. concluded from their research that even with steroid therapy alone, the mortality rate appeared to be low when compared with conservative treatment for pneumonia caused by sars-cov, and the combination of an effective antiviral and steroid was associated with a better outcome 34 . the same results from omrani et al., a retrospective cohort study, ifn plus ribavirin have a decreased mortality rate than supportive treatment only, and didn't significantly increase adverse effects.apart from antiviral therapy, management should primarily focus on strict lungprotective ventilation 35 . our analysis indicated that the overall mortality rate of coronavirus-infected critically ill patients was about 69.0%, and 11.2% in mild ill patients, in accordance with imran khalid's conclusion that delay in remedy would increase mortality 35 . but this caculated mortality rate may be higher that its actual level, for publication bias. as a consequence, early dignosis and intervention would greatly improve outcomes 19 . this also suggested us paying attention to early screen of close contacts and suspected patients of such disease was equally crucial. clinically, combination of ifn and ribavirin are reletively widely adopted to coronavirus onfection, though lack of robust evidence 3 . one well-designed randomized placebo-control trial regarding effects of recombinant ifn-β1b plus opinavir/ritonavir was registed in 2018 and still pending completion 27 . in this rct, primary and secondary outcomes are mortality in the icu, mortality in the hospital and 28-day mortality, 90-day mortality, sequential organ failure assessment scores at baseline and on study days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. this seems to be the best conceived trial to determine the efficacy of antivirals in coronavirus infection. we are looking forward to the successful administration of this clinical trial, and calling for largescale prospective randomized studies to assess the role of antivirals for the treatments of coronavirus, to better guide clinical practice.in conclusion, type i interferons seem to improve respiratory distress, relieve lung abnormalities, present better saturation, reduce needs for supplemental oxygen support. type i interferons seem to be well tolerated, and don't increase life threating adverse effects. we still recommend type i interferons serving as first-line antivirals in coronavirus infections within local protocols, with timely administration and monitoring of adverse events. and interferons may be used to treat sars-cov-2 infected patients. well-designed large-scale prospective randomized control trials are greatly needed to provide more robust evidence on this topic.no financial or nonfinancial benefits have been received or will be received from any table 2 the study designs, treatment strategies, and outcomes of included studies for evaluation of safety, efficacy, tolerability, and treatment-related outcomes of interferon for coronavirus infection in clinical practice coronaviruses (covs) are enveloped viruses with a positive single-stranded rna virus, which are widely distributed in humans and animals to cause respiratory infections in humans [1] . nowadays, the ongoing pandemic of covid-19 caused by the novel coronavirus syndrome-coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation [2] . as of april 14, 2020, 1,924,626 cases and 119,625 deaths in total have been confirmed around the world, suggesting that the overall death rate of covid-19 was 6.2%. although sars-cov-2 and sars-cov share similarities in phylogeny and clinical trials, the new type of coronavirus seems to have a higher spread and lower mortality [3] . a study reported that sars-cov-2 invades into the cells through its predicated receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) [4] . blocking the renin-angiotensin system can prevent new-onset diabetes and reduce the risk of diabetes complications [5] . du et al. [6] found that the elderly who are over 65 years old showed higher risk of suffering from the disease, especially those with severe complications and patients who had experience of entering managed by antonio secchi. the intensive care unit (icu) than those who did not. this finding indicated that complications may be a risk factor for adverse consequences. a recent meta-analysis reported that hypertension, diabetes, copd, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease are major risk factors for patients with covid-19, but the impact of these risk factors on covid-19 mortality has not been explored [7] . therefore, this meta-analysis first aims to explore the possible clinical mortality between diabetes and covid-19, analyze if diabetes patients infected with sars-cov-2 are exposed to the worst clinical prognostic risk, and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence. this result may help the government formulate prevention policies and respond to the outbreak of covid-19, ultimately contributing to the better clinical management of patients with covid-19 and diabetes.the preferred reporting items for meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines were used. we determined to include studies involving in covid-19, sars-cov-2, or diabetes. to find relevant primitive articles, we performed a comprehensive retrieval in databases, involving medline via pubmed, embase, and web of science with the following words: we also reviewed reference lists based on the recognized literature to find additional eligible studies. we first screened both titles and abstracts of the articles, and publications which may involve in data concerning covid-19, sars-cov-2, or diabetes.primitive studies were carefully examined, and there were no nation restrictions in our study. the inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) all studies reporting data on covid-19 nonsurvivors, survivors, and laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients; (2) studies limited to mankind, contained original data, published in english and appeared in the form of either abstract or full-text. the exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) duplicate studies, letters, case reports, abstracts, or reviews; (2) research focusing on morbidity rather than mortality. we collected the following information from each study: publication year, first author's name, sample size, age for both dead group, and alive group.we assessed the quality of each involved research by the newcastle-ottawa scale [8] . meta-analysis was conducted via review manager 5.3. by calculating the i 2 index to evaluate the heterogeneity, the i 2 values of < 25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, and 75-100% were considered as homogeneous, low, moderate, and high heterogeneous levels, respectively. if the i 2 value was > 50%, the random effects model (rem) would be applied. if the i 2 value was < 50%, the fixed effects model (fem) would be applied. the pooled odds ratios (ors) of different studies and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (cis) were used to estimate the relationship between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19. then, the sensitivity analysis was repeated, with the impact of each study evaluated by deleting different individual studies each time.a total of 597 potentially relevant articles were identified using our search strategy from databases and 1 from reference lists. four hundred and sixty studies remained after ruling out duplicates. after screening the titles and abstracts, 347 research articles that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria were ruled out. after scanning the main body of the reserving 13 records, another seven articles were excluded. finally, nine qualified articles met the eligibility criteria [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . the steps of document retrieval are shown in fig. 1 . meanwhile, the common characteristic of included studies is listed in table 1 . the metaanalysis involved 926 cases (260 dead and 666 alive) overall that were all published in 2020. one study [9] reported the settings in icu and isolation wards. all articles are of high quality because nos score was no less than 6.the outcome of the forest plot for the connection between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19 is shown in fig. 2 . our results showed a close relationship between diabetes and mortality of covid-19, with a pooled or of 1.75 (95% ci 1.31-2.36; p = 0.0002). the pooled data were calculated with the fem as no heterogeneity appeared in the studies.we chose age as the subgroup, and there was no significant difference between age ≥ 70 subgroup and age < 70 subgroup, and the or was 1.33 (95% ci 0.78-2.28, p = 0.30) and 2.05 (95% ci 1.44-2.94, p < 0.001), respectively, in fig. 3 . as a result of insufficient data, the impact of age stratification on mortality of covid-19 should be further carried out. meanwhile, our study demonstrated no heterogeneity (i 2 = 5%), and upon eliminating the impact of yuan's study and wang's study, the results significantly affected the pooled outcomes (i 2 dropped from 5% to 0). therefore, we assumed that the studies of yuan et al. and wang et al. may be the sources of heterogeneity in this meta-analysis. the sensitivity analysis results showed that the ors ranged from 1.50 (95% ci 1.01-2.23) to 2.03 (95% ci 1.29-3.20). the risk of publication bias was analyzed by begg's test (p = 0.09) and egger's regression test (p = 0.36), indicating no significant publication bias in our meta-analysis. our meta-analysis suggested that the mortality of patients with covid-19 was significantly related to diabetes with or of 1.75 (95% ci 1.31-2.36; p = 0.0002). meanwhile, the value of i 2 = 5% (i 2 < 50, p < 0.01) indicated that no heterogeneity exists in the studies. in addition, sensitivity analysis revealed that when excluding any single study or rem was converted to fem, the total outcomes still held.so, we are confident in the validity of the data obtained in our study, showing a powerful correlation between diabetes and the mortality of patients with covid-19. despite the unclear pathophysiology, it has been observed that the most severe and fatal cases of covid-19 occur in the elderly or patients with potential complications, especially those with diabetes [18] . according to the reports, diabetes and high blood glucose levels are important predictors of the severity and death of patients infected with different viruses, involving sars-cov and mers-cov [19, 20] . a study found elderly patients with chronic diseases, including diabetes, were at higher risk of severe covid-19 infection and death [21] . insulin resistance promotes synthesis of end-glycosylation products and stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and adhesion molecules, resulting in a higher likelihood of infection and worse prognosis [22] .infection leads to destruction of pancreatic beta cells, decreased pancreatic insulin content, and changes in the host's ability to respond normally to glucose tolerance tests [23] . a previous study suggested that sars coronavirus uses ace2 as a receptor to enter and damage islet cells that cause acute diabetes [24] . until now, there was no relevant study exploring the role of ace2 in covid-19 diabetic patients. a recent meta-analysis retrieved the data of 2108 chinese patients diagnosed with sars-cov-2 infection and found the prevalence of diabetes is 10.3% [25] . but, until now, no meta-analysis has explored the possible mortality between diabetes and covid-19. therefore, our meta-analysis results found a significant relationship between diabetes and mortality covid-19, with a pooled or of 1.70 (95% ci 1.16-2.48; p = 0.006), which may contribute to better clinical management of patients with covid-19 and diabetes.compared with younger patients, patients aged 65 and over showed higher risk of initial complications, more severe symptoms, and were more prone to multiple organ involvement and death [12] . similarly, feng et al. [26] recruited 476 covid-19 patients from three different cities in china and the survival rate of patients over 75 years old was significantly lower than that of young patients. factors leading to poor health include physiological changes in aging and multiple age-related complications. a study held the opinion that older people's suspicion and detection threshold for sars-2 should be lower, such as temperature, the decline in pulmonary function, and shortness of breath [27] . management began with the diagnosis and classification of the elderly in order to achieve an appropriate level of care. simultaneously, our age subgroup analysis results indicated that there was no significant difference between age ≥ 70 subgroup and age < 70 subgroup. however, if we chose the threshold for age stratification as 65 years old, in the age ≥ 65 subgroup, the or would be 1.73 (95% ci 1.28-2.34; p = 0.0003). so, more research on the impact of age stratification on mortality of covid-19 diabetic patients should be carried out.this is the first attempt to use meta-analysis to prove whether the mortality of patients with covid-19 is related to diabetes. at the same time, our study has some limitations. first, due to the inadequate data, we do not have access to information such as diabetes duration, time of diagnoses, diabetes type, diabetes medications and complications, and thus we cannot conduct risk stratification in the subgroup analysis within the diabetic population. second, we only obtained the information regarding the age and gender of covid-19 patients, but other factors might influence the accuracy of results, such as bmi [28] , measurements, and instruments for the detection of sars-cov-2. meanwhile, the populations included in our study were mainly in asian populations and so these conclusions, even if important, cannot be extended automatically to caucasian or other populations. finally, the patients who are diagnosed with covid-19 may have multiple chronic diseases simultaneously, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and copd, which may affect the accuracy of the results. meanwhile, the samples are not quite enough and more large-scale studies are needed.our meta-analysis showed that diabetes increases the mortality of patients with covid-19. these results indicated the disturbance of blood glucose in the covid-19 patients. more importantly, this meta-analysis grades the reliability of evidence for further basic and clinical research into the diabetes dysfunction in covid-19 patients.in december 2019, the pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus spread in wuhan, china. unbiased sequencing of samples from patients with pneumonia reveals a previously unknown type of beta-coronavirus which is similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). 1 the causative agent was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) by coronavirus study group, and the disease it caused was named coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) by the world health organization (who). 2 , 3 sars-cov-2 is a new type of highly diverse enveloped positive single stranded rna virus, which can cause a range of symptoms including self-reported fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, and diffi- * corresponding author.e-mail

spread by respiratory droplets caused by coughing or sneezing. 5 , 6 as of march 19,  there are now more than 20 0,0 0 0 covid-19 cases and more than 8,0 0 0 deaths in the world. 7 nevertheless, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human coronavirus. therefore, it is crucial to determine the drug treatment plan as soon as possible to deal with the outbreak of covid-19. 8 corticosteroids have a good inhibitory effect on inflammatory factors and are often used as an auxiliary treatment for viral pneumonia. the main anti-inflammatory effect of glucocorticoids is to inhibit a large number of pro-inflammatory genes that encode cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes, and receptors to address the inflammatory process and restore homeostasis. 9 however, the results of clinical studies on the role of corticosteroids remain controversial. a retrospective study showed that the vast majority of sars patients received satisfactory results from the use of corticosteroids. 10 but in a retrospective observational study of mers patients, the result showed that patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to requirethe inclusion criteria in this meta-analysis were as follows: (1) subjects in each study were patients with coronavirus infection; (2) the patients were divided into the experimental group using corticosteroids and the control group not using corticosteroids; (3) the outcomes included the use of corticosteroids in critical and noncritical patients, mortality, length of stay (los) and adverse reactions to corticosteroids. exclusion criteria: (1) the same patients were enrolled in different articles; (2) commentaries, editorials, case reports, letters and family-based studies; and (3) patients in studies were under 18 years old.the two researchers (zhenwei yang and jialong liu) who performed the inclusion and exclusion of the literature also independently extracted data from the included studies. differences were resolved with a third investigator (xixian zhao) or by consensus. we extracted the following variables: the authors, the publication year, the study design, viral type, population, treatment details (including corticosteroid use, types and doses of corticosteroids, and other treatments), and outcome measures such as the use of corticosteroids in critical and non-critical patients, mortality, los and adverse reactions to corticosteroids (including bacterial infection, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia and hypokalemia).we used the newcastle-ottawa scale (nos), 12 which includes patient selection, study comparability and outcome assessment three components, to evaluate the quality of the original study. the work was done by two authors (zhenwei yang and jialong liu) and agreed upon through discussion.all statistical analyses in this study were performed on stata14.0 (stata, college station, tx, usa). for dichotomized data, we calculated the risk ratio (rr) and the 95% confidence interval (ci), while for continuous data, we calculated the weighted mean difference (wmd) and the 95% ci. heterogeneity among the studies was assessed by the chi squared and i 2 tests. a random-effects model was used when either p < 0.10 or i 2 > 50% defined significant heterogeneity across the articles. otherwise, the fixed-effects model was used. we carried out a sensitivity analysis on the stability of the combined results. in addition, we also performed a subgroup analysis by virus type to explore the source of heterogeneity. publication bias was assessed by funnel plots.as shown in fig. 1 , the total number of records initially determined based on the search strategy was 1685. after removing 412 duplicates, we deleted another 1203 articles by reading the title and abstract of the article. we eliminated 55 articles by reading the full-text articles of the remaining 70 studies, four of which enrolled the same patients, two of which were non-adult patients, and 49 of which did not have a control group not using corticosteroids. finally, there were 15 articles included in our metaanalysis. 5 , 10 , 11 , 13-24 study characteristics 5270 patients from 15 articles were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. due to one article did not give the number of people treated with corticosteroids, 14 patients with sars-cov infection, two included patients with mers-cov infection, and the remaining two included patients with sars-cov-2 infection. there were 7 articles describing the use of corticosteroids in critical and non-critical patients, 5 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 23 9 articles recorded the mortality, 10 , 11 , 14-18 , 20 , 22 three studies reported the los, 11 , 18 , 22 2 articles described the adverse reactions to corticosteroids. 21 , 24 in addition, all studies had nos scores ≥6.the details of each included study are presented in table 1 .the results showed that patients with severe conditions were more likely to require corticosteroids therapy (rr = 1.56, 95% ci = 1.28-1.90, p < 0.001; fig. 2 ). there was significant heterogeneity among the studies ( i 2 = 90.2%, p < 0.001), the random effects model was adopted. similar results were also observed in the subgroup analysis of patients with sars-cov-2 infection (rr = 2.36, 95%ci = 1.31-4.28, p = 0.004, i 2 = 29.1%, p = 0.235) and patients with sars-cov infection (rr = 1.46, 95%ci = 1.18-1.80, p < 0.001, i 2 = 92.7%, p < 0.001). sensitivity analysis showed that the result was stable.the pooled rr from the nine studies revealed that the mortality was higher in patients who received corticosteroids therapy (rr = 2.11, 95%ci = 1.13-3.94, p = 0.019, i 2 = 80.9%, p < 0.001; fig. 3 ).when we performed subgroup analysis, we found that the mortality of neither sars-cov (rr = 2.56, 95%ci = 0.99-6.63, p = 0.053, i 2 = 77.4%, p < 0.001) nor mers-cov (rr = 2.06, 95%ci = 0.66-6.44, p = 0.213, i 2 = 89.4%, p = 0.002) was correlated with corticosteroids therapy. sensitivity analysis showed that the result was not stable. when we excluded a study, 14 the result was different from the previous conclusion.los was longer in the corticosteroid group (wmd = 6.31, 95%ci = 5.26-7.37, p < 0.001, i 2 = 1.8%, p = 0.361; fig. 4 ), and the same result was found in the subgroup analysis of patients with sars-cov infection (wmd = 6.34, 95%ci = 5.24-7.44, p < 0.001, i 2 = 50.3%, p = 0.156).as shown in table 2 we examined the publication bias of the included literature on the use of corticosteroids in critical and non-critical patients and mortality. funnel plots showed that there was no publication bias on the use of corticosteroids in critical and non-critical patients ( fig. 5 a) , while there might be publication bias on mortality ( fig.  5 b) .as sars-cov-2 is an emerging virus, there is no effective antiviral treatment at present. covid-19 patients were mainly treated with symptomatic therapy. in clinic, corticosteroids are widely used in symptomatic treatment of severe pneumonia. however, there has been considerable controversy as to whether covid-19 patients should be treated with corticosteroids. russell and colleagues recommend that corticosteroids should not be used in sars-cov-2-induced lung injury or shock outside of a clinical trial. 25 but a team of front-line physicians from china had a different perspective, they recommended short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate dose, used prudently, for critical patients with covid-19 pneumonia. 26 so it is very important to provide evidence for corticosteroid treatment of in patients with coronavirus.in this systematic review and meta-analysis, the result indicated that patients with severe conditions were more likely to require corticosteroids therapy. the similar results were also observed in the subgroup of patients with sars-cov-2 infection and patients with sars-cov infection. a study showed that the concentrations of cytokines (such as interleukin 7 [il7], il8, il9, il10 and so on) in serum in the covid-19 patients were higher than in healthy adults. in addition, cytokines (such as il2, il7, il10 and so on) concentrations in intensive care unit (icu) patients were higher than non-icu patients. these revealed that patients with covid-19 were usually accompanied by increased immune factors and inflammatory responses, and the concentrations of immune factors were associated with the severity of the disease. 5 further autopsy revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar injury with fibrous mucinous exudate and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration dominated by lymphocytes, which were very similar to sars-cov and mers-cov infections. 27 as we all known, corticosteroids do not directly inhibit virus replication, their main role is anti-inflammatory and suppress immune response. 28 in the early stage of inflammation, glucocorticoids reduce capillary dilation, inflammatory cell exudation, leukocyte infiltration, and phagocytosis. in the late stage, glucocorticoids can inhibit the excessive proliferation of capillaries and fibroblasts. furthermore, by binding to their receptors, glucocorticoids inhibit nuclear transcription factor-κb (nf-κb) signaling and further inhibit the transcription and translation of inflammatory factors. 9 these explained why corticosteroids therapy was more needed in severely ill patients with coronavirus infection. our analysis demonstrated that patients treated with corticosteroids had a higher mortality rate, and longer los. there might be multiple mechanisms that contributed to these outcomes. there is a study shows that glucocorticoids inhibit the production of il-2 and interferon-γ (ifn-γ ) in t lymphocytes, shift t cell responses from the th1 to the th2 type, induce programmed cell death in a variety of different immunologically relevant cells, including immature t and b cell precursors and mature t cells. 29 another study find that preexisting cd4 + t cells are associated with lower viral shedding and less severe disease. 30 there is evidence that the use of corticosteroids may lead to prolonged removal of viral rna from the airways, 11 blood, 31 and feces of patients, 32 resulting in longer hospital stays, and ultimately increasing the risk of mortality. in addition, our analysis found that patients receiving corticosteroid therapy were more likely to develop bacterial infection due to immunosuppression. this could make the disease worse and lead to death. we also performed subgroup analysis, the result indicated that the mortality of neither sars-cov nor mers-cov was associated with corticosteroids therapy. sensitivity analysis showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with mortality when we excluded a study. 14 therefore, we need to treat this result with caution.our analysis found that patients receiving corticosteroids therapy might cause some serious adverse reactions such as bacterial infection and hypokalemia. however, only two studies in our analysis reported data on adverse reactions to corticosteroids, bias might have occurred due to the limited number of patients.there were several meta-analyses explored the role of corticosteroids in viral pneumonia, most of which shown adverse consequences. in a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with sars, a total of 29 studies on corticosteroids were included, of which 25 were inconclusive, and only 4 provided conclusive data on the harms of corticosteroids. 33 in a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with influenza pneumonia, the results showed that compared with placebo, corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality, longer icu los, and a higher rate of secondary infection but not mechanical ventilation days. 34 in addition, a meta-analysis included ten studies with 1137 recovered sars patients showed that patients who received higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids were more likely to develop osteonecrosis. 35 these meta-analyses indicated that patients with coronavirus pneumonia could not benefit from corticosteroid treatment. however, there are some limitations in this meta-analysis. first, most of the included studies are retrospective cohort studies, historical control studies, etc., with a low level of evidence and a lack of randomized controlled trials with optimized design. second, there is no uniform standard for the time and dosage of hormones used in various studies. third, the effects of corticosteroids may be influenced by other therapeutic options, such as antiviral drugs. finally, due to the rapid evolution of the sars-cov-2 situation, some studies have not been published, while other developments are not intended to be reported for reasons of confidentiality, which will lead to publication bias.patients with severe conditions were more likely to require corticosteroids. corticosteroids could lead to higher mortality, longer los, a higher rate of bacterial infection and hypokalemia. therefore, corticosteroid should be used with caution in the treatment of covid-19 patients: corticosteroids are not recommended for pa-tients with mild conditions, and moderate corticosteroids can be used in patients with severe conditions to suppress the immune response and reduce symptoms. nevertheless, more multicenter clinical trials are needed to further verify this conclusion.all the authors designed the study. zhenwei yang, jialong liu and yunjiao zhou designed the literature search and searched the articles. zhenwei yang, jialong liu and xixian zhao contributed to the data extraction process. all the authors analysed the data. zhenwei yang wrote the first draft of article. all the authors revised the article and approved the final version.no authors have competing interests in this research.the work was supported by a research grant from the national natural science foundation of china (jing liu, grant no. 81472735 ) and the wuhan university (jing liu, grant no. 2042019kf0206 ).the world health organization (who) reported the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 known as covid-19 in late december 2019 in china. as of april 5, 2020, based on the who report (i.e., https://www.who. int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situationreports), the numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases and mortalities were 1133758? and 62784?, respectively. moreover, the sequence similarity scores of covid-19 with bat sars-like, sars-cov, and mers-cov were about 99, 96, and 50%, respectively (1) .epidemiologically, the covid-19 outbreak has spread to more than 200 countries resulting in who risk assessment status as ''very high''. for this purpose, several authors have recently carried out their researches on covid-19, which were mostly based on clinical and epidemiological views and included the potential symptoms, the ways of covid-19 transmission, and epidemic issues (2) . among them, hellewell et al. proposed a stochastic transmission model that resulted in the case and contact isolations to control the covid-19 outbreak (3) . moreover, peeri et al. compared the epidemics of three types of coronaviruses, namely sars, mers, and covid-19. they concluded that there were no frequent outbreaks found from two previous ones, and the challenges for the covid-19 should be covered by the applications of the internet of things (iot), which will be beneficial for control the incidence among people (4). two systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies were available in the literature. they proposed five useful factors (i.e., clinical, laboratory, imaging features, procalcitonin measurements, outcomes of confirmed cases) in predicting the severity of the covid-19 disease (5e7).in the current study, the comparisons between incidence and mortality, as well as recovery and death rates among the countries for covid-19 and sars-cov with the higher incidence rates, were performed using the meta-analysis approach developed in the meta-mums tool. the statistical analyses used both subgroup forest plots using event rate and risk ratio statistics.data for meta-analysis could be extracted from open datasets (8) . the original and well-known data resources for covid-19 were world health organization (who), i.e., https:// www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 /situation-reports, and worldometers, i.e., https://www. worldometers.info/coronavirus/. the retrieved parameters for the countries to be meta-analyzed were total sample size, cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative mortalities, and total recovered cases; and, the data for high-risk countries in terms of incidence related to covid-19 was extracted up to april 5, 2020. moreover, the summary table of sars-cov was available from https://www.who.int/csr/sars/ country/country2003_08_15.pdf?ua&equals;1 for the period november 16, 2002eaugust 7, 2003.the analysis environment was the meta-mums tool as a comprehensive meta-analysis tool without any limitations in number size and data entry (9, 10) . analysis of dichotomous data was done with a 95% confidence interval to set lower and upper limits based on risk ratio (rr) as well as event rate (er) when no interventions are involved (11) . in all calculations and analyses, the p-values less than 0.05 were statistically significant.the evaluation of heterogeneity between the analyzed countries was by calculating the i 2 test and cochrane's q test. and, whenever a significant heterogeneity was present, a random-effects model was used; otherwise, we utilize a fixed-effects model. additionally, subgroup analysis was carried out among the target countries to compare the effect sizes of ''incidence vs. mortality'' and ''recovery vs. mortality'' using risk ratio. and, subgroup analysis was performed for comparing effect sizes of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates using event rate.in the current meta-analysis, n 5 1124243 patients of covid-19 infection, and n 5 8346 of sars-cov were available and retrieved from the initial research of who and worldometer freely accessible databases. the ''incidence vs. mortality'' and ''recovery vs. mortality'' ratios are also determined. indeed, subgroup analyses were also performed for evaluation of learning significant differences of er and rr.event rates of incidence, recovery, and mortality of covid-19, and sars-cov infections are as the following:the incidence event rates of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below, and the forest plots are illustrated in figure 1a , showing the relationships between two infectious diseases.logit er 5 à 7:257; ll 5 à 7:768; ul 5 à 6:747; p !0:001 logit er 5 à 12:303; ll 5 à 13:910; ul 5 à 10:695; p !0:001 so, the incidence rate of covid-19 is more than sars-cov ( p !0.001) and the same outcomes apply to the cumulative incidence rates with ( p !0.001).the mortality event rates of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as follows, where the forest plots figure 1b shows the relationships between two viral diseases. logit er 5 à 3:113; ll 5 à 3:439; ul 5 à 2:786; p !0:001 logit er 5 à 1:914; ll 5 à 2:515; ul 5 à 1:312; p !0:001the mortality rate of sars-cov infection is more than covid-19 infection ( p !0.001), by also considering their cumulative mortality rate with p !0.001.recovery event rate of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below, and the forest plots are illustrated in figure 2a , showing the relations between both diseases. logit er 5 à 1:913; ll 5 à 2:4675; ul 5 à 1:359; p !0:001 so, the recovery rate of sars-cov infection is more than covid-19 infection ( p !0.001) with the same results using the cumulative recovery rate with p !0.001.incidence vs. mortality results of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below. the forest plots illustrated in figure 2b show the relations between the two diseases.log rr 5 à 4:089; ll 5 à 4:512; ul 5 à 3:666; p !0:001 log rr 5 à 9:845; ll 5 à 11:074; ul 5 à 8:615; p !0:001and, the mortality rate is higher than the incidence rate in both infection groups, and subgroup analysis showed that in sars infection, the mortality rate is more than incidence rate in comparison to covid-19 disease ( p !0.001). cumulative incidence vs. mortality rateof covid-19 and sars-cov infections reflected the above results with p !0.001.recovery vs. mortality results of covid-19 and sars-cov infections are as below. the forest plots are illustrated in figure 3 , showing the relations between the two diseases.log rr 5 0:867; ll 5 0:389; ul 5 1:345; p !0:001 log rr 5 1:895; ll 5 1:300; ul 5 2:489; p !0:001 which resulted, the recovery rate is more than the mortality rate in both infectious groups, and subgroup analysis has shown that in sars infection, the recovery rate vs. mortality rate is higher than that of covid-19 ( p !0.008). and, cumulative recovery rate vs. mortality rate of covid-19 and sars-cov infections reflected the above results with p !0.001.some recent news reported that the covid-19 has more mortality rate than the combination of sars and mers (12) . however, one should note that, while this comes to statistical analysis, the whole population of the world and countries are essential factors.the rapid virus spread, known as also super spreading people, played a vital role in previous sars-cov (case fatality rate of 9.6%) and mers (case fatality rate of about 38%) outbreaks, and also needs special attention in covid-19 as well (13) .in summary, we demonstrated the statistical analyses of incidence, mortality, and recovery rates between covid-19 and sars-cov, along with their subgroups analysis. and, hopefully, this would shed more evidence in controlling the new infectious disease.the limitations of the current meta-analysis are as below:the use of open datasets. all data were observational numbers reported for incidence, mortality, and recovery values.only the countries with higher incidence values (those which are high-risk countries based on who criteria assessment) are involved in the current meta-analysis, which might be influenced by selection bias in the future.due to the nature of the meta-analysis, the evaluation of publication bias was not possible.the current meta-analysis provided more information on incidence, mortality, and recovery rates between covid-19 and sars-cov infectious diseases. based on event rate evaluation, the incidence rate of covid-19 was higher than sars-cov's where mortality and recovery rates for sars-cov were higher in comparison with covid-19. on the other hand, the risk ratio and subgroup analysis of ''incidence vs. mortality'' and ''recovery vs. mortality'' for both covid-19 and sars-cov revealed new findings. those were the higher mortality and recovery rates of both sars-cov and covid-19 in comparison to incidence and mortality rates, respectively.who declared the covid-19 outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2), a pandemic on march 11, 2020. 1 initially, superspreading events, a cruise ship in japan, mass gathering of a religious group in south korea, skiing resorts in italy and austria, and a popular pilgrimage city (iran) contributed to the rapid dissemination globally. since then, the rate of global spread has accelerated, and widespread epidemics have occurred in numerous countries.the sars-cov-2 virus is genetically closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), the first pandemic threat of a novel and deadly coronavirus that emerged in late 2002 and caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars). sars-cov was highly lethal but faded out after intense public health mitigation measures. 2 by contrast, the novel sars-cov-2 that emerged in december, 2019, rapidly caused a global pandemic. the sars 2003 outbreak ceased in june, 2003, with a global total of 8098 reported cases and 774 deaths, and a case fatality rate of 9·7%, with most cases being acquired nosocomially. 2 in comparison, the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov)-another deadly coronavirus, but which is currently not presenting a pandemic threat-emerged in 2012, and has caused 2494 reported cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries and has a very high case fatality rate of 34%. 3 because mers-cov is wide spread in dromedary camels, zoonotic cases continue to occur, unlike sars-cov, which emerged from wildlife and was eliminated from the intermediate host reservoir.the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 is less deadly but far more transmissible than mers-cov or sars-cov. the virus emerged in december, 2019, and as of june 29, 2020, 6 months into the first pandemic wave, the global count is rapidly approaching 10 million known cases and has passed 500 000 deaths. 4 because of its broad clinical spectrum and high transmissibility, eradicating sars-cov-2, as was done with sars-cov in 2003, does not seem a realistic goal in the short term.in this personal view we summarise key epidemiological characteristics of sars-cov-2 in comparison with other epidemic coronaviruses and pandemic influenza. we explore what makes sars-cov-2 different from pandemic influenza virus and the other epidemic severe coronaviruses such as sars-cov and mers-cov. we study the various characteristics of each virus, including the transmission and severity characteristics, case fatality rates (mortality in individuals with the disease), and the• the basic reproductive rate (r 0 ) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is similar to, or higher than, the r 0 of sars-cov and pandemic influenza • mortality due to sars-cov-2 and sars-cov is strongly skewed towards people older than 70 years, dissimilar to the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics • the proportion of symptomatic people requiring hospital admission is higher for sars-cov-2 infections than for the 2009 influenza pandemic • the population risk of admission to the intensive care unit is five to six times higher in patients infected with sars-cov-2 than in those with the fairly mild 2009 influenza pandemic • the case fatality rate is probably around 1% after adjusting for asymptomatic and mild illness; serological studies will aid in refining this estimate estimating the ability of a new pathogen to spread is a key measure in an emerging disease outbreak. a metric used to describe this spread is the basic reproductive rate (r 0 ) . r 0 is defined as the average number of secondary transmissions from one infected person; when r 0 is greater than 1, the epidemic is growing. the r 0 estimates for sars-cov, sars-cov-2, mers-cov, and the influenza pandemics are summarised in the appendix (p 1).the r 0 for the sars outbreak in 2003 was estimated to be between 2•0 and 3•0 in the early months (until the end of april), before public health control measures were introduced. 2,5,6 various control measures soon reduced the transmissibility to 1·1, with a wide iqr of 0·4-2·4. 6, 7 for mers-cov, the r 0 (unmitigated) was estimated to be 0·69 (95% ci 0·50-0·92), consistent with mers-cov never having caused sustained epidemics. 8, 37 for sars-cov-2, a recent china joint mission by who concluded that "trans mission of sars-cov-2 is mostly driven by clusters in close contacts, particularly family clusters, and less so by community transmission". 9 since the statement was released, this conclusion has been challenged, although superspreading events continue to occur in the pandemic. studies have estimated the r 0 at 2·2 (95% ci 1·4-3·9) 10 and 2·7 (2·5-2·9); 11 therefore, an average r 0 of 2·5 seems a reasonable estimate (appendix p 1). by comparison, the initial r 0 estimate for the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic was 1·7, 12 later estimated between 0·17 and 1·3 after mitigation was initiated. 13-15 r 0 for the 1918 influenza pandemic was estimated at around 2·0 in the first wave in july, 1918. 16 the r 0 values have important implications for disease control. r 0 magnitude indicates the level of mitigation efforts needed to bring an epidemic under control. 6 mitigation reduces the effective transmission coefficient, now called r e . r e needs to be reduced to less than 1 to ensure cessation of an epidemic, which can be done by rapid case identification, quarantine measures, and physical distancing to prevent secondary transmissions. for childhood diseases such as measles, the cessation of epidemic spread was achieved with an effective vaccine. however, a vaccine has never been a major tool for control of pandemics because they either occurred before the era of modern vaccines or, as in 2009, the vaccine became available only after the first waves had already occurred.for sars-cov-2 with an r 0 value of approximately 2·5, transmission would need to be reduced by more than 60% to reach r e of less than 1 (1-1/r 0 ). the transmissibility coefficient declines over time as control measures start having an effect, which was seen during the successful eradication of sars-cov in 2003. 8 by contrast with sars-cov and sars-cov-2, mers-cov has limited transmissibility even in the absence of mitigation, although the virus has caused several nosocomial outbreaks since 2012, mainly in hospitals in saudi arabia, jordan, and south korea. 17all three coronaviruses have a longer incubation period (time from infection to symptom onset) than influenza viruses. one study estimated the mean incubation period of sars-cov-2 to be 5·8 days, ranging from 1·3 to 11·3 days. 18 another study estimated the median incubation period to be 5·1 days and found that 97·5% of people showed symptoms within 11·5 days of infection. 19 a study from china estimated an incubation period of 5·2 days. 9 a notable difference between sars-cov, sars-cov-2, and mers-cov are the kinetics of virus shedding. whereas sars-cov and mers-cov have tropism for lower airways, with less virus present in the upper respiratory tract, this tropism is different in sars-cov-2. for sars-cov-2, the average viral load in a family cluster was 6·8 × 10⁵ copies per upper respiratory tract swab during the first 5 days, and live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. 20 in a study from hong kong, 38 high viral loads were found in the first samples obtained after admission to hospital. this finding was con firmed in a study from china, 39 which found a high viral load at the onset of symptoms that declined in the following 5-6 days. this quick decline in the viral load makes isolation and quarantine of patients with sars-cov-2 and their contacts much more chal lenging and less effective, as it has to be done as soon as possible after illness onset in order to reduce trans mission. by contrast, for sars-cov viral loads peaked at 6-11 days after symptom onset, 21, 22 allowing a full extra week to identify and isolate cases before transmission occurred. this difference would in part explain why sars could be eradicated in 2003 compared with the trajectory seen in the sars-cov-2 pandemic. there is increasing evidence of transmission from asymptomatic people, although what proportion of these individuals are presymptomatic remains unknown. it is clear that covid-19 has a broad clinical picture which includes asymptomatic and mild illness. 23, 40 a study from iceland 24 found that 43% of pcr-positive cases had no symptoms, although some individuals showed symptoms later on (number of days remains unknown). unofficial data from china suggest that 78% of cases were asymptomatic. 25 viral shedding might be occurring for prolonged periods. a study of viral load 26 in respiratory tract samples, faeces, and blood from 96 patients with covid-19 found a viral load of 10⁵-10⁶ copies per ml up to 3 weeks after symptom onset. viral shedding tended to be longer in stool samples; however, as of june 9, 2020, there is no docu mented evidence of faecal-oral transmission. viral load is higher and persists for longer in the lower respiratory tract of patients who are severely ill with covid-19. 26 for sars, lower respiratory tract infection occurred without upper respi ratory tract infection. as a consequence, transmission of sars-cov was infrequent during the first 5 days of illness, 2 and unlike transmission of influenza, transmission in household settings was rare. 41a key difference between sars-cov-2 and pandemic influenza is the age distribution of patients who are severely ill. the mortality rate in people infected with sars-cov-2 increases steeply with age, and fatal outcomes are almost exclusively seen in people older than 50 years (table 2) . this age-related increase in severe morbidity and mortality was also observed for sars-cov (although with a far greater case fatality). in hong kong, the case fatality due to sars-cov was 0% for age group 0-24 years, 6% for those aged 25-44 years, 15% for those aged 45-64 years, and 52% for people who were 65 years and older. 2, 27 for both sars and covid-19, children rarely had severe illness (table 2) . recently, a rare hyperinflammatory syndrome has been reported in children with covid-19. 45 in one study looking at close household contacts of people with covid-19, 28 children and adults both had a secondary attack rate of 15%, but whether children transmit the virus as effectively as adults is still unknown.clinical case fatality, for which the case definition was fever and respiratory symptoms (including pneumonia), was around 5% in hubei province and only around 1% in the rest of china and south korea. 43 in the usa, case fatality rates among patients with covid-19 were less than 1% for people aged 20-54 years, 1-5% in those aged 55-64 years, 3-11% in those aged 65-84 years, and 10-27% in people aged 85 years and older. early in the outbreak there have been few deaths in children and young adults younger than 20 years. 46 although most patients (90%) with covid-19 have mild clinical illness, there is considerable demand for intensive care because of the subset of patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. this requirement for respiratory support is higher for sars-cov-2 cases than for the influenza pandemic in 2009 (table 1) . in a study 29 of patients who were admitted to hospital in new york, ny, usa, 14% required intensive care (median age 68 years).a danish study of the 2009 influenza a h1n1 pandemic 47 found that the proportion of patients with pandemic influenza never exceeded 4·5% of the total national intensive care unit (icu) bed capacity, and the icu admission rate was estimated to be approximately one patient per 5500 patients infected with influenza a h1n1. 48 such figures are lacking for the covid-19 pandemic, but it is evident that icu capacity in this pandemic is a crucial element. in lombardy, italy, an estimated 2·3% of covid-19 cases needed an icu bed. 44 comparing these rates is difficult because most people in the 2009 pandemic were younger than 60 years, whereas sars-cov-2 affects mainly older individuals. we compared key variables and features of the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics with sars-cov-2, sars-cov, and mers-cov in table 3.fatality rates, % 43 and italy. 44 average age of death in italy is 81 years, and mortality in italy in people older than 90 years was 19%. 44 the mortality impact of seasonal and pandemic influenza has long been estimated as the excess mortality above baseline. excess mortality is ideally estimated from a mortality time series updated once per week, during, or at the end of a pandemic. 30, 31 a study on excess mortality in the 2009 influenza pandemic used data from 33 countries, 31 and found that the global burden was approximately 300 000 deaths. the mean excess mortality for seasonal influenza was 0·1-6·4 per 100 000 people younger than 65 years, 2·9-44·0 per 100 000 people aged 65-74 years, and 17·9-223·5 per 100 000 people aged 75 years and older. 31 it is too early to study excess mortality for covid-19 in south korea and italy, but such studies from china would be helpful. as of june 8, 2020, in lombardy (italy), the mortality rate for covid-19 has reached 159 per 100 000 population. 32 notably, these data are not from the end of the outbreak and numbers are expected to increase further, as some patients spent 4 weeks in intensive care and thus have not yet resolved the infection. the timely european morbidity and mortality (euromomo) surveillance system updated once per week is a great resource for accessing excess mortality studies relating to the covid-19 pandemic in european countries. 49 the website shows z score elevations in a time series of deaths due to any cause, allowing comparison with elevations caused by seasonal influenza. the euromomo data show high covid-19 associated excess mortality in a number of countries including italy, spain, the uk, and sweden, whereas other countries such as germany, norway, and greece have found no, or low, excess mortality (appendix p 2). case fatality rates are shown in table 4. 49 in the usa, the centers for disease control and prevention also reports substantial elevation in national respiratory deaths. 50 for com parison, the influenza pandemic excess mortality has ranged from extreme (1918) to mild (2009) over the past 100 years (table 3) . a study modelling global excess mortality for the moderate 1957 influenza a h2n2 pandemic 30 found a respiratory excess mortality rate of 0·02%. for the deadly 1918 influenza pandemic estimates show that about 1-2% of the global population died. 51 however, excess mortality for the 2009 pandemic was not much greater than that of a severe seasonal influenza, at about 0·04% deaths in the global population 30, 31 because the mean age at death varied greatly in past pandemics, one excess mortality study also looked at excess years of life lost. 30 using years of life lost as a metric, this study found that the three influenza pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009 had a similar size effect. although it is too early to draw conclusions, the effect of covid-19 might be higher in terms of excess mortality, possibly with numbers somewhere in between the 1957 and 1918 influenza pandemics. however, in terms of excess years of life lost, because of the mean age (~80 years) of covid-19 fatalities, the covid-19 pandemic would score lower, perhaps similarly to the 1957 and 1968 influenza pandemics. more time and data are needed before the covid-19 pandemic can be accurately compared with past pandemics.because of the broad clinical spectrum, it has become evident that to find out the true attack rate of sars-cov-2 serological studies are needed. meanwhile we can look at reported cases, deaths, and the number of tests per 100 000 population, understanding that more testing and a broader clinical case definition mean a higher rate of cases. currently, each country is in a different phase of the pandemic, which will lead to a bias in early country comparisons.official figures are available for the usa, south korea, the uk, spain, germany, and south africa (table 4, appendix pp 3-4). as of feb 16, 2020, hubei, the earliest affected province in china, had 67 466 confirmed cases of covid-19 and 2902 deaths reported. 9 these figures correspond to 0·11% of the population being affected and a mortality rate of 4·8 per 100 000 population, which is low compared with certain countries in europe, 52 possibly because people with mild symptoms were not tested. [23] [24] [25] serological surveys will shed light on these discrepancies. for comparison, seasonal influenza attack rates are in the range of 10-20% every winter. 53it a recent study 54 modelled possible scenarios for covid-19 up to 2024, on the basis of epidemiology of the seasonal coronaviruses oc43 and hku1. the study assumed a winter-time r 0 of 2·2 and a summertime r 0 of 1·3, and predicted winter cycles of covid-19 after the pandemic phase. by comparison, the a h1n1 influenza pandemic started in mexico in february, 2009, and by june a total of 73 countries had reported more than 26 000 laboratory-confirmed cases. 55 in july, 1918, there was a peak of h1n1 influenza infections seen in copenhagen before the second wave hit in november. 16, 56 these previous pandemics have shown that influenza transmission does occur over the summer and seasonality is difficult to predict. temperature and humidity makes a difference for viral survival in the environment. a study using enveloped virus phi6 as a surrogate virus 57 found that infectivity was sensitive to temperature and decreased by two orders of magnitude between 19°c and 25°c. some data on the effect of temperature are available for sars-cov only. a study of sars-cov found a two-log reduction in virus titre after 7 h at 38°c and 95% humidity. 58 at 4°c, sars-cov persisted for up to 28 days, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% relative humidity. inacti vation was faster at 20°c than at 4°c at all humidity levels. these experimental data suggest that sars-cov-2 might be less able to survive in the summer.a mortality study 59 in 17 cities in the usa during the 1918 influenza pandemic found that the cities which implemented mitigation strategies early on had a delayed, flatter epidemic curve, with a 50% lower peak mortality, and a 20% lower overall mortality. thus, mitigating policies are of paramount importance to ensure that the burden on the health-care system remains manageable. the examples of china and south korea, and early signs of bending the curve seen in europe, show that influencing the spread of sars-cov-2 is possible. however, the socio economical costs are enormous and will be long lasting.radical containment measures have been used to curb the pandemic in some affected countries. the approach taken in south korea was especially effective, done by rapidly applying extensive testing, quarantine, and contact tracing of individuals from a large church group in the early stages of the outbreak. also, schools were closed, and all international arrivals were quarantined for 2 weeks. 43 china, south korea, and singapore show that mitigation using a combination of contact tracing and rigorous social distancing measures is possible. 60 however, new outbreaks have started to occur in each of these countries and renewed control measures have been implementedcountries such as denmark, italy, spain, and germany have relied mostly on social distancing and hygiene measures, in population lockdowns of various magnitudes of intensity. such draconic measures were used when the epidemics were progressing too fast and capacity for effective case identification, contact tracing, and containment became impossible. the consensus is that rigorous mitigation measures are needed early to slow down sars-cov-2 transmission. 61 drastic measures of quarantine and mobility restrictions put in place by china, europe, and the usa are no different than those used for plague in the 14th century. the covid-19 pandemic so far has shown that such measures could possibly halt the pandemic if individuals follow the specific country guidelines.the first who "disease x" scenario has become a reality. 33 the sars-cov-2 pandemic has already caused severe morbidity and mortality in older adults, much higher than in the pandemic influenza. although children are clearly less affected, their role in the transmission of the virus still needs to be studied.at this early stage in the pandemic there are no effective treatments such as antivirals or passive immunisation schemes. development of a safe and effective vaccine will take time. thus, only supportive treatment in hos pitals is currently available, and efforts to slow and limit the spread of the virus continue. the goal is to reduce the impact of the virus, prevent overwhelming the health-care system, and protect the people at highest risk of severe outcomes, while waiting for an effective vaccine and treatments.historical evidence from influenza pandemics which occurred in the past century shows us that pandemics personal view tend to come in waves over the first 2-5 years as the population immunity builds-up (naturally or through vaccination), and then the number of infected cases tends to decrease. this observation is the most likely trajectory for the sars-cov-2 virus. however, the near future will require a transition to a new normal, in which a combination of physical distancing, enhanced testing, quarantine, and contact tracing will be needed for a long time. while clinical research and testing of antivirals and vaccine candidates is ongoing, scientists will learn from regions and countries that were first affected. also, epidemiological and phylogenetic studies can yield much information about risk factors (other than age) such as disease transmission, the role of children in transmission, and a better estimate of case fatality.it is highly likely that after sars-cov-2 there will be another pandemic. it might be another coronavirus, an influenza virus, a paramyxovirus, or a completely new disease. we believe that learning from this experience is crucial so that we can meet a future pandemic threat with far better preparation in terms of testing, adequate stocks of personal protective equipment, and critical care capability. international pandemic planning is needed to ensure collaboration between countries, including better surveillance of emerging infections especially zoonoses. controlling an outbreak has everything to do with mitigating casualties such as economic losses, joblessness, loneliness, and even loss of human dignity at the end of life.ep and sak drafted the personal view. mk contributed to the description of influenza virus, mers-cov, sars-cov, and sars-cov-2. ug, dhh, np, fc, and ms helped with the

are well-known causes of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) and also important pathogens for concomitant pneumonia in copd (cp-copd). however, the differences in a viral infection pattern and clinical impacts of respiratory viruses between the two groups have not been well investigated. the clinical and microbiological data from copd patients admitted with ae-copd (n ¼ 281) or cp-copd (n ¼ 284) between january 2010 and december 2012 were reviewed. after excluding 88 patients (40 with ae-copd and 48 with cp-copd) who did not undergo a multiplex rt-pcr test for respiratory viruses, the demographic characteristics, identified viruses, and clinical outcomes of the ae-copd and cp-copd groups were compared. respiratory viruses were identified in 41.9% of ae-copd group and 33.5% of the cp-copd groups. the most common virus was influenza virus in the ae-copd group (33.7%) versus human coronavirus (24.1%) in the cp-copd group. influenza virus was significantly more common in the ae-acopd group than in the cp-copd group (p < 0.01). in-hospital mortality of ae-copd and cp-copd were 1.2% and 12.3%, respectively (p < 0.01). among cp-copd patients, in-hospital mortality of patients with only viral infection group, only bacterial infection group, and viral-bacterial co-infection were 2.6%, 25.8%, and 17.5%, respectively (p ¼ 0.01). respiratory viruses were commonly identified in both ae-copd and cp-copd, influenza virus and human coronavirus were the most common viruses identified in ae-copd and cp-copd patients, respectively. the mortality rates of only viral infection group was significantly lower than only bacterial infection or viralbacterial co-infection group in cp-copd patients. j. med. virol. 88:2092 -2099 , 2016 .chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is one of the leading global causes of mortality and morbidity [pingleton et al., 1992; pena et al., 2000] . according to a recent study, the overall prevalence of copd has been estimated as high as 10% of the world's population [soriano et al., 2010] . acute exacerbation of copd (ae-copd) and concomitant pneumonia in copd (cp-copd) are two serious conditions that often complicate copd [wedzicha and seemungal, 2007; mullerova et al., 2012] . respiratory viruses are a well-known cause of ae-copd, which are responsible for 39-56% of ae-copd [seemungal et al., 2001; rohde et al., 2003] . recently, newly discovered respiratory viruses such as human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus nl63 and hku1, and bocavirus have been added as important causes of ae-copd [ringshausen et al., 2009; kherad et al., 2010] . also, with the development and application of technology to detect viral nucleic acid, the detection of respiratory viruses in ae-copd has markedly improved [mohan et al., 2010] .on the other hand, the role of respiratory viruses in cp-copd has not been well investigated. until recently, there have been only a few reports on the role of respiratory viruses in cp-copd patients [mallia and johnston, 2007; ko et al., 2008; molinos et al., 2009; vanspauwen et al., 2012] . moreover, these previous studies have several limitations. some were focused on a specific virus such as influenza virus [mallia and johnston, 2007] or an rt-pcr test was performed in only small portion of the studies patients [ko et al., 2008; molinos et al., 2009] . furthermore, to the best our knowledge, none of the prior studies compared the viral etiologies and their clinical outcomes between ae-copd and cp-copd. we aimed to investigate the distributions and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in ae-copd and cp-copd patients.this retrospective cohort study was performed at asan medical center, a 2,700-bed tertiary referral hospital in seoul, republic of korea. the current study focused on copd patients admitted from january 2010 to december 2012. all patients admitted to hospital due to copd during study period were screened, and all those diagnosed with ae-copd or cp-copd were included in the study (see below for definitions). data regarding clinical outcomes and microbiologic results were collected according to a standardized protocol. if a patient was admitted to the hospital more than once during study period, only the first admission was included in the ae-copd or cp-copd groups. also, all clinical samples obtained from patients within first 72 hr after admission were included in the study. the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of asan medical center. informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of this study.diagnosis and severity of copd were defined by the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (gold) guidelines [vestbo et al., 2013] . ae-copd was defined clinically by presentation of at least two of the following symptoms; increased shortness of breath, increased sputum volume and purulence with no definite pneumonic infiltration on chest x-ray [anthonisen et al., 1987] . cp-copd is defined as a pneumonia in copd patients. pneumonia was defined as the presence of a new radiographic pulmonary infiltration plus two or more of the following; (i) fever (38.5˚c or higher) or hypothermia (<36.5˚c); (ii) leukocytosis or leukopenia (white blood cells >10,000/mm 3 or <4,000/mm 3 ); or (iii) purulent tracheal aspirate or sputum [pingleton et al., 1992; mandell et al., 2007] .microbiological examination included a gram stain and culture of sputum, endotracheal aspirates, or bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid, blood cultures, and a binax now urinary antigen test for streptococcus pneumoniae and legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 (binax inc., portland, me). a pcr assay using bd probetec et atypical pneumonia assay (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was used to detect atypical pathogens including mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophilia pneumoniae, and l. pneumophila. for viral detection, a multiplex rt-pcr kit (seeplex 15rv ace detection kit, seegene inc., seoul, korea) for influenza virus a and b, respiratory syncytial virus a and b, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1 to 4, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human coronavirus 229e/ nl63, oc43, hku1 were used. the rt-pcr kit used in this study has been validated in published studies [bibby et al., 2011; gharabaghi et al., 2011] .data from the ae-copd and cp-copd groups were compared using the student's t-test or mann-whitney u test (continuous variables) and the x 2 test or fisher's exact test (categorical data). also, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for mortality, particularly in cp-copd patients. variables showing a reasonable relationship with mortality or with p-values less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. the results were expressed as adjusted odds ratios (aors) with 95% confidence intervals (cis). furthermore, we performed a separate x 2 test for in-hospital mortality in cp-copd patients with different etiologies. all p-values were two-tailed and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. all statistical analyses were performed using spss version 18.0 for windows (ibm spss, inc., chicago, il).during the 3-year-study period, a total of 1,628 copd patients were admitted to asan medical center. of these patients, 281 patients were classified to the ae-copd group and 284 patients were classified to the cp-copd group. after excluding 88 patients (40 with ae-copd and 48 with cp-copd) who did not undergo a multiplex rt-pcr test for respiratory viruses, 241 ae-copd patients and 236 cp-copd patients were finally included for analysis. table i shows the baseline characteristics of patients and laboratory data. the mean age (aesd) was 71.9 (ae9.3) and 412 patients (86.4%) were male. diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity, followed by congestive heart failure, and malignancy. congestive heart failure tended to be more common in the ae-copd group (14.5% vs. 8.9%, p ¼ 0.06).recent fev 1 was significantly lower in the ae-copd than that in the cp-copd group (47.6% predicted value vs. 53.1%, p ¼ 0.01). the ae-copd patients were also more likely to receive systemic steroid treatment (12.8% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.01) and to be on home oxygen therapy at the time of admission (13.3% vs. 7.2%, p ¼ 0.02). median values of white blood cells counts, c-reactive protein (crp) level, and procalcitonin level were significantly higher in the cp-copd patients. other baseline characteristics are shown in table si .we analyzed with all respiratory samples. respiratory samples comprised nasal swabs or sputum samples (n ¼ 384), bal only (n ¼ 33), or both (n ¼ 60). table ii includes the distributions of the pathogens identified. one or more respiratory pathogens were identified in 112 ae-copd patients (46.5%) and 145 cp-copd patients (61.4%) (p < 0.01). among the ae-copd patients, 101 patients had viral infections (41.9%, 101/241), 53 had bacterial infections (22.0%, 53/241), and 42 had immunosuppresed hosts as follows: (i) daily administration of corticosteroids (at least 5 mg per day of prednisolone or an equivalent drug); (ii) solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients; (iii) patients that received chemotherapy for an underlying malignancy during the last 6 months; and (iv) patients with an underlying acquired immune deficiency disorder. table ii indicates the distributions of viral pathogens identified in both groups. viral infections tended to be more common in the ae-copd group (p ¼ 0.06). influenza virus (n ¼ 34) was the most commonly identified virus in the ae-copd group, followed by rhinovirus (n ¼ 25), parainfluenza virus (n ¼ 23), and human coronavirus (n ¼ 15). in contrast, human coronavirus was the most common virus in the cp-copd group (n ¼ 19), followed by rhinovirus (n ¼ 18), parainfluenza virus (n ¼ 17), and influenza virus (n ¼ 15). influenza virus was significantly more common in the ae-copd group than in the cp-copd group (14.1% [34/241] vs. 6.4% [15/236], p < 0.01). almost all of the influenza virus types identified in the two groups were type a (33/34 in ae-copd and 13/15 in cp-copd).table ii also lists the distributions of bacterial pathogens in both groups. bacterial infections were significantly more common in the cp-copd group (p < 0.01). s. pneumoniae (n ¼ 16) was the most commonly identified in the ae-copd group, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (n ¼ 11), klebsiella pneumoniae (n ¼ 9), and staphylococcus aureus (n ¼ 8). by contrast, s. aureus was the most common bacteria in the cp-copd group (n ¼ 24), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (n ¼ 21), p. aeruginosa (n ¼ 21), and k. pneumonia (n ¼ 17). s. aureus and a. baumannii were significantly more common in the cp-copd group than in the ae-copd group (p < 0.01). figure 1 shows the seasonal distribution of admitted patients during the study period. the number of admitted patients was largest during the winter season (december to february) in both groups. figure s1 shows the seasonal distribution of each viral pathogen in ae-copd and cp-copd. influenza virus predominated from december to february. parainfluenza virus and human coronavirus were mainly present from may to november and from january to june, respectively. human metapneumovirus peaked in the spring season (april and may). rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were present throughout the year with a little winter season dominancy.table iii compares the clinical outcomes between the ae-copd and cp-copd groups. despite an initial icu admission rate that was not significantly different between the groups (10.8% vs. 15.7%, p ¼ 0.12), cp-copd patients initially admitted to the general ward were more likely to need icu care than ae-copd patients during a hospital stay (1.7% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01). among patients who needed icu care, the median length of an icu stay (4 vs. 11 days, p < 0.01) and total mechanical ventilation time (100 hr vs. 300 hr, p < 0.01) were significantly longer in the cp-copd group. median hospital stay was significantly longer in the cp-copd group (7 vs. 9 days, p < 0.01) and in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the cp-copd group (1.2% vs. 12.3%, p < 0.01). among cp-copd patients, in-hospital mortalities of patients with only viral infection group, only bacterial infection group, and a viral-bacterial co-infection were 2.6%, 25.8%, and 17.5%, respectively (p ¼ 0.01) (table sii) . however, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality between these same groups among ae-copd patients (p ¼ 0.45) ( table siii) . the results of a separate x 2 test conducted using data about in-hospital mortality among cp-copd patients revealed that the only viral infection group had a significantly better outcome than the only bacterial infection (p < 0.01) or viral bacterial co-infection (p < 0.03) groups. however, in-hospital mortality rates of patients with bacterial infection alone and those with viral-bacterial co-infections were not significantly different (p ¼ 0.35). univariate logistic regression analysis identified single viral infection as a significant independent predictor of 28 day mortality in cp-copd patients (hazard ratio, 0.090; 95% ci, 0.012-0.689; p ¼ 0.02). single viral infection remained a significant predicting factor in multivariate logistic regression analysis (hazard ratio, 0.095; 95% ci, 0.012-0.740; p ¼ 0.03) (table siv) .while respiratory viruses were frequently identified in both ae-copd (41.9%) and cp-copd (33.5%), the distribution of identified viruses between two groups showed different patterns. influenza virus was the most common pathogen in ae-copd versus human coronavirus in cp-copd. rhinovirus has been reported as the most common cause of ae-copd in the majority of prior investigations [seemungal et al., 2001; rohde et al., 2003; hutchinson et al., 2007; mcmanus et al., 2008; hershenson, 2013] , although human metapneumovirus [martinello et al., 2006] or respiratory syncytial virus [dimopoulos et al., 2012] occasionally have been reported as the most common cause. here, we found that influenza virus (14.1%) was the most commonly identified virus in the ae-copd group, followed by rhinovirus (10.4%). the hong kong group also showed that influenza virus was most commonly identified in ae-copd patients [ko et al., 2008] . however, these findings should be interpreted with caution as both studies included ae-copd patients who were admitted to general hospitals.. therefore, a bias might have been introduced if less severely affected patients did not come to our tertiary care hospital.unexpectedly, human coronavirus was the most commonly identified virus in our cp-copd group, which has not been reported before. excluding outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)coronavirus [peiris et al., 2003] human coronavirus have never been regarded as a common cause of pneumonia. the presence of viruses in pneumonia patients does not necessarily mean that these viruses are the true pathogen of pneumonia. in our current study, of the 19 cp-copd patients with human coronavirus infection, 12 (63.2%) had bacterial co-infection, including six with s. aureus and two with s. pneumoniae. a prior report showed that there was an increase in s. aureus acquisition during the sars period [yap et al., 2004] . recently, a polish group reported that human coronavirus nl63 increases the streptococcal adherence to respiratory epithelial cells [golda et al., 2011] , and that human coronavirus nl63 infection is associated with an increase in platelet-activating factor receptor (paf-r) expression, which promotes adherence of s. pneumoniae. our study supports the work by golda et al. who saw the same events but in an in vitro assay. these finding suggests that human coronavirus infection might be associated with a risk of pneumonia development through bacterial coinfection in copd patients. further studies will be needed to confirm this result.regarding the bacterial pathogens identified in our present investigation, s. aureus and a. baumannii were significantly more commonly identified in the cp-copd group than the ae-copd group. these bacteria are a well known cause of health-care associated pneumonia (hcap) or hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) [yoo et al., 2013] . however, a. baumannii has not been listed as the cause of ae-copd and s. aureus is an uncommon cause of ae-copd (approximately 0-6%) [domenech et al., 2013; reissig et al., 2013] . exposure to recent antibiotics during hospital stay might have influenced the type of pathogen, and more than 20% of cp-copd events were hospital-acquired infections or health care associated pneumonia. the patients in the cp-copd with s. aureus group received antibiotics more frequently than those in the other pathogen group (62.5% [15/24] vs. 11.0% [9/82], p < 0.01). in addition, previous studies performed in korea showed that s. aureus and a. baumannii are important pathogens, particularly in hcap and hap patients (with ranges of 6.1-19.8% and 2.0-16.0%, respectively) [choi et al., 2012; hong et al., 2014] .although ae-copd patients have a greater severity of disease than cp-copd patients in baseline pulmonary function test, cp-copd patients were associated with poorer clinical outcomes than ae-copd patients, in terms of length of hospital stay and in hospital mortality. we found that few investigators to date have compared the outcomes between ae-copd and cp-copd. recently, a spanish group compared the clinical outcomes between 133 ae-copd patients and 116 cp-copd patients [huerta et al., 2013] . similar to the results of our study, ae-copd patients had a greater severity of disease than cp-copd patients. however, in their results, in-hospital mortalities of ae-copd group and cp-copd group were 3.0% and 3.4%, respectively, which are quite different from those of our patients especially in the cp-copd group (1.2% in the ae-copd group and 12.3% in the cp-copd group). we thought that these differences might reflect a different severities of illness in the two patient populations. the icu admission rate of patients between two groups were different (in the spanish study 3.8% in the ae-copd group, 2.6% in the cp-copd group versus 10.8% and 15.7% of the our studied patients in each). this difference might explain the outcome difference between the two groups.among patients with a viral infection, with regard to bacterial co-infection, 41.6% of our ae-copd patients and 50.6% of our cp-copd patients had a bacterial co-infection, respectively. notably, among our cp-copd patients, only viral infection group had significantly better outcomes than the only bacterial infection group or the viral bacterial co-infection group. this finding suggests that when bacterial coinfection complicates viral infection, it can lead to poorer outcomes. however, according to a separate x 2 test, the mortality rates of patients with bacterial infection alone and virus-bacteria co-infection were not significantly different. thus, it seems that the impact of viral infection on the mortality of cp-copd patients with bacterial infection may not because nearly all patients were tertiary referrals from other hospitals, the study population might not be representative of the general population. third, the viruses identified by a sensitive rt-pcr could be bystanders, rather than causative pathogens. if other admitted patients who had neither ae-copd nor cp-copd were included as controls, we might indirectly be able to estimate the proportion of nonsignificant colonizers. however, this is not possible due to the retrospective design of the study. it was also difficult to establish a cause-effect relationship and it is not clear whether people developed ae-copd or cp-copd following infection. fourth, our study did not include control patients with viral infection alone (without ae-copd or cp-copd) and it was, thus, difficult to determine the precise role of the virus in mortality due to ae-copd or cp-copd. also, due to the retrospective nature of the study, some data were missing. for example, it was very difficult to obtain an accurate time of transfer from other hospitals and data of prior antibiotics use. since we often did not know how long a patient was resident in the transferring hospital, we could not take this into account. finally, since the number of each virus was relatively small, the characteristics of each viral infection could not be compared between the groups. in conclusion, respiratory viral infection is common to both ae-copd and cp-copd. however, the distribution of respiratory viruses involved was different between these two groups of patients. the clinical outcomes of cp-copd patients with only viral infection were better than those with only bacterial infection or viral-bacterial co-infection. the factors associated with the clinical outcomes of cp-copd patients included age and presence of bacterial infection. these findings warrant future studies of larger scale with appropriate control patients.yk contributed to study conception and design. hck,

hundred countries around the world, affecting more than 2,818,000 people and has caused more than 196,000 deaths, as of april 25, 2020 [1] . on march 11, 2020 , the world health organization (who) had declared covid-19 a pandemic because of alarming levels of its spread, severity and inaction [2] . covid-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), which is sufficiently genetically divergent from the closely related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), to be considered a new humaninfecting betacoronavirus [3] . it mainly affects the respiratory tract and the illness ranges in severity from asymptomatic or mild to severe or critical disease. although the current estimate of the case fatality rate of covid-19 is <5%, up to 15-18% of patients may become severe or critically ill, some of them requiring icu care and mechanical ventilation [4] .since covid-19 is a new disease, knowledge about this disease is still incomplete and evolving. many case-control studies have shown that patients of covid-19, who have underlying diabetes mellitus, develop a severe clinical course, and also have increased mortality. however, most of these studies have small sample size, and the data in them are heterogenous and conflicting. in addition, the data on prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19 is also not clear.hence, this meta-analysis was conducted with the primary objective of exploring the relationship between underlying diabetes and severity and mortality of covid-19 disease; and with the secondary objective of determining the prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19.since, this is a meta-analysis, therefore an institutional board or an ethics committee approval was not required. the prisma (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) and moose (meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines were consulted during the stages of design, analysis, and reporting of this metaanalysis [5] [6] [7] . the protocol of this meta-analysis is registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero) vide registration number crd42020181756 and is available in full on the nihr (national institute for health research) website (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?recordid=181756).three authors (ak, saa and sk) independently searched, screened and selected the studies according to the search, inclusion and exclusion criteria. pubmed database was searched for papers in english language using the following keywords: "2019-ncov", "ncov-2019", "novel coronavirus 2019", "sars-cov-2", "covid-19", "coronavirus", "coronavirus covid-19", and "corona virus". since the first report of covid-19 disease was published on december 31, 2019 [8] , we limited our search to articles published since january 01, 2020, and the last search was performed on april 22, 2020. since there is a high likelihood of duplicate publications on covid-19 [9] , especially, same set of patients being reported in english as well as chinese or other languages, hence we restricted our search to papers published in english language only. for the same reason we restricted our search to pubmed database only and did not search other databases. in addition, each included study was carefully evaluated for study setting and author list to exclude any duplicate publication.the inclusion and exclusion criteria of studies were as follows:(1) the studies should be in english language in the pubmed database.(2) the study design should be case-control and should have categorized the patients into two or more groups depending on the severity, clinical course, or mortality of the patients with covid-19 (i.e. composite endpoint). studies without this categorization were not included. the study should have data of diabetes mellitus in each group.(3) the study should be observational (retrospective or prospective). interventional studies such as controlled or uncontrolled drug trials were excluded. (4) the study should have included at least 100 patients of covid-19.(5) the participants should be adult patients with covid-19. studies describing exclusively pediatric population were excluded, however, studies which had both adult and pediatric patients were included. studies describing exclusively pregnant women were also excluded.the following data were extracted from each study: date of online publication, pmid number, study setting, total number of patients, their demographic data, number of patients with composite endpoint, and number of patients with diabetes mellitus among patients with or without the composite endpoint. for studies with missing data, the corresponding authors of those studies were contacted with a request to provide the missing data.the primary outcome of interest was the occurrence of composite endpoint which for the purpose of our study was labelled as 'severe clinical course' and defined as occurrence of one of the two endpoints depending on each study's [11, 12] ; or iii. american thoracic society guidelines [13] .patients not having any of the above features of 'severe clinical course' were categorized into 'good clinical course'.the secondary outcome of interest was to study the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with covid-19.for the assessment of quality of studies, including the risk of bias, the national institute of health (nih) tool for case-control studies was used. this tool has been developed jointly by the national heart, lung and blood institute (nhlbi) and the research triangle institute international [14] . it uses a composite score of twelve domains, with each domain scored as '1' or '0' depending on the response 'yes' or 'no', respectively. the studies were categorized as good quality if they scored ≥8 points, fair quality if they scored 6-7 points, and poor quality if they scored <6 points.the categorical data was displayed as n and % and continuous data as mean and sd. if the study had reported the data as median with iqr or range, the method described by wan et al was used to calculate the mean and sd [15] .to study the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with covid-19, pooled proportion and 95% confidence interval (ci) was taken as the effect size. first the raw proportion from each study was extracted and transformed with the freeman-tukey double arcine method to stabilize the variance [16] , then the pooled proportion was obtained using the dersimonian-laird random effects model [17] .to study the association of diabetes mellitus with the composite endpoint (severe clinical course), pooled odds ratio (with 95% ci) was taken as the effect size. we performed the meta-analysis using the generic inverse variance approach and dersimonian-laird random effects model [17] . a p value of <0.05 was used to show statistically significant association. the meta-analysis was sub-grouped according to the composite endpoint of severe disease and mortality.to assess the heterogeneity among studies i 2 statistic was calculated. an i 2 value >50% indicated substantial heterogeneity. to take care of heterogeneity among the studies, and to calculate a more conservative result, the odds ratios were pooled using only the random effects model. to explore the source of heterogeneity meta-regression analysis was done using age, type of composite endpoint (severity versus mortality), country of study (china versus others), number of patients, quality score, and quality type (good versus fair) as covariates. in addition, if the heterogeneity among the studies was ≥50%, a sensitivity analysis was also performed after identifying and removing the outlier studies.we evaluated the publication bias through visual inspection of funnel plot and begg [18] and egger [19] tests. when the funnel plot was symmetrical and the p value of begg and egger tests were >0.05, no significant publication bias was considered to exist in the metaanalysis. however, if publication bias was found, a trim and fill analysis of duval and tweedie [20] was used to evaluate the number of missing studies, and recalculation of the pooled odds ratio was done after addition of those missing hypothetical studies. using the keywords "2019-ncov", "ncov-2019", "novel coronavirus 2019", "sars-cov-2", "covid-19", "coronavirus", "coronavirus covid-19", and "corona virus" and limiting the entrez date from 01-jan-2020 through 22-apr-2020, initially 5834 publications in english language were retrieved from the pubmed database, which were screened for relevance ( figure 1 ). after carefully going through the abstracts and full texts (if needed) of these publications, only 207 potentially relevant studies were selected and evaluated in detail for potential inclusion. of these 174 studies were excluded because of the following reasons:(1) 144 studies did not have comparative data on covid-19 patients with and without composite endpoint; (2) 22 studies were small with less than 100 participants; (3) 7 studies did not have diabetes as one of the comparative factors; and (4) 1 study was a duplicate publication. hence, remaining 33 studies were included in the qualitative as well as quantitative synthesis meta-analysis ( figure 1 ).the study characteristics of the 33 included studies are given in table 1 . the online publication date of the studies in the pubmed database was from february 7, 2020 through april 17, 2020. twenty out of 33 (61%) studies were from single centres, while remaining 13 (39%) were multi-centre studies. most studies (30/33, 91%) were from mainland china, and of the remaining 3 studies, two (6%) were from usa, and one (3%) from france. the total included patients were 16,003, and of them 8,849 (55%) were reported from mainland china, 7,030 (44%) from usa, and 124 (1%) from france. the median number of patients included in the studies was 214 (iqr: 139-368).the quality of study was assessed using the nih tool for case-control studies [14] and the results are shown in table 1. the scores were as follows: 9/12 score (27 studies [82%]); 8/12 score (5 studies [15%]); and 7/12 score (1 study [3%]). out of the twelve domains assessed by this tool, the three domains in which all the studies were given '0' score were: sample size justification, blinding of assessors, and adjusting for confounding variables. thus 32 studies (97%) were judged as good quality (scores of ≥8) and remaining 1 study (3%) was judged as fair quality (scores 6-7). none of the included study was judged poor. the single study with fair quality was the paper published by the cdc, usa on the covid-19 cases reported to it from all over the us [22] . thus, it was a registry data, rather than a hospitalbased study.the table 2 shows the characteristics of the included patients. the total number of patients was 16,003, with proportion of males being 54% (5,068/9,366). thus the male : female ratio was approximately 1.2 : 1. the pooled mean age was 52.6±17.4 years.of the 16,003 patients, 2,827 (18%) patients had the composite endpoint (labelled 'severe clinical course'). the reasons for composite endpoint were mortality in 9 studies (613/2,827 [22%] patients) and severity in 24 studies (2,214/2,827 [78%] patients). of the 24 studies having severity as the composite endpoint, the reasons were as follows: pre-defined criteria (16 studies); icu requirement versus no requirement (2 studies); invasive ventilation requirement versus no requirement (2 studies); progressive disease versus stable disease (2 studies); refractory disease versus responsive disease (1 study); and ards versus no ards (1 study).diabetes was present in 1,724 patients out of total 16,003 patients of covid-19. the pooled prevalence of diabetes was calculated to be 11.2% (95% ci: 9.5%-13.0%) by using the freeman-tukey double arcine transformation and dersimonian-laird random effects model ( figure 2 ). however, the heterogeneity among the studies was substantial with an i 2 value of 92%. to explore the source of heterogeneity meta-regression analyses were done using age, type of composite endpoint (severity versus mortality), country of study (china versus others), number of patients, quality score, and quality type (good versus fair) as co-variates (supplementary table 1 and supplementary figure 1) . the results of meta-regression showed that proportion of diabetes in patients with covid-19 was influenced by age (with studies with higher patient age having higher proportion of diabetes, p<0.001), type of composite endpoint (with studies reporting mortality endpoint having higher proportion of diabetes, p=0.004), and country of study (with studies outside of china having higher proportion of diabetes, p=0.006). there was no influence of number of patients in studies or quality score of studies. a sub-group analysis revealed that proportion of diabetes mellitus in china was 10.5% (95% ci: 8.7%-12.3%) while in countries other than china (mainly usa) it was 19.3% (95% ci: 8.4%-30.3%), but with high heterogeneity (data not shown). a sensitivity analysis was also done by excluding 13 outlier studies, which revealed a pooled prevalence of diabetes to be 9.8% (95% ci: 8.7%-10.9%) in patients with covid-19 with an acceptable i 2 value of 46% (supplementary figure 2) .of the 33 included studies in this meta-analysis, 24 had used severity as the composite endpoint and 9 had used mortality as the composite endpoint. presence of diabetes was found to be significantly associated with severe covid-19 (pooled odds ratio 2.75 [95% ci: 2.09-3.62; p<0.01]) as well as mortality due to covid-19 (pooled odds ratio 1.90 [95% ci: 1.37-2.64; p<0.01]). the combine pooled odds ratio for both the composite endpoints (labelled as severe clinical course) was 2.49 (95% ci: 1.98-3.14; p<0.01) ( figure 3 ).for the mortality endpoint, the heterogeneity among the studies was low (i 2 =32%), while for the severity endpoint the heterogeneity among the studies was substantial (i 2 =63%). thus the combined heterogeneity was also substantial (i 2 =63%). to explore the source of heterogeneity meta-regression analyses were done using age, type of composite endpoint (severity versus mortality), country of study (china versus others), number of patients, quality score, and quality type (good versus fair) as co-variates (supplementary table 2 and supplementary figure 3) . the results of meta-regression showed that odds ratio was influenced by age (with studies with higher patients' age having lower odds ratio, p<0.001). in addition it was found that the cdc study from usa [22] , which was of not good quality (being a registry data), significantly influenced the outcome of this meta-analysis and was mainly responsible for the significant heterogeneity. hence, a sensitivity analysis was performed after excluding this study, which again revealed a significant combined pooled odds ratio of 2.33 (95% ci: 1.90-2.85; p<0.01) and an i 2 value of 41% (acceptable heterogeneity) (supplementary figure 4) .for the main outcome of this meta-analysis, i.e. association of diabetes mellitus with severe clinical course of covid-19, publication bias was evaluated through the visual inspection of funnel plot and begg and egger tests [18, 19] . the funnel plot (figure 4 ) was found to be mildly asymmetric and the begg's rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry (kendall's τ = 0.439) as well as egger's regression test for funnel plot asymmetry (z = 2.561) were statistically significant (p<0.05). hence, a trim and fill analysis of duval and tweedie [20] was used to evaluate the number of missing studies and we recalculated the pooled odds ratio with the addition of those missing hypothetical studies. the recalculated pooled odds ratio of association of diabetes mellitus with severe clinical course of covid-19 was 2.26 (95% ci: 1.78-2.87; p<0.01) (supplementary figure 5) . the redrawn funnel plot after addition of four missing hypothetical studies was now symmetrical (supplementary figure 6) .after adjusting for both, heterogeneity as well as publication bias, the corrected pooled odds ratio for diabetes mellitus being associated with severe clinical course of covid-19 (i.e.both mortality and severity) was still significant (2. figure 7) .to summarise the results of this meta-analysis of 33 studies (16,003 patients), we found diabetes mellitus to be significantly associated with mortality risk of covid-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 1.90 (95% ci: 1.37-2.64; p<0.01) with low heterogeneity (i 2 =32%). in addition, diabetes mellitus was associated with severe covid-19, including risk of ards, icu requirement, and invasive ventilatory requirement, with a pooled odds ratio of 2.75 (95% ci: 2.09-3.62; p<0.01). the combined pooled odds ratio of diabetics developing severe covid-19 or dying due to it (i.e. composite endpoint) was 2.49 (95% ci: 1.98-3.14; p<0.01). after adjusting for both, heterogeneity among the studies as well as publication bias, the corrected pooled odds ratio for diabetes being associated with severe clinical course of covid-19 was still significantly high (2.16 [95% ci: 1.74-2.68]; p<0.01). as a secondary outcome, we also calculated the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with covid-19, which was 11.2% (95% ci: 9.5%-13.0%) (uncorrected) and 9.8% (95% ci: 8.7%-10.9%) (after adjusting for heterogeneity).there are many strengths of this meta-analysis. first, to the best of our knowledge this is the first large meta-analysis on specific influence of diabetes on severity of covid-19, as well as on its mortality. in addition, we also studied the prevalence of diabetes among covid-19 patients. second, we have included a large number of studies, with patient population above sixteen thousand, spanning three continents. third, we have included only large studies, with more that 100 patients, thus each study contributed a robust data on diabetes-covid19 association without increasing heterogeneity. fourth, we have avoided including any duplicate studies by limiting our search to single database, limiting search to english articles only, and carefully going through each included article's study setting and author list. fifth, while synthesizing results we have taken care of both heterogeneity as well as publication bias by appropriate statistical tools.first discussing about the secondary outcome of our meta-analysis, we determined the corrected pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus in covid-19 patients to be close to 10%, with a higher prevalence in usa than china. our results on prevalence are similar to a large chinese nationwide study of 1590 patients which had shown the prevalence of diabetes in covid-19 patients to be 8.2% [23] . another small meta-analysis of 12 chinese studies (2,108 patients) by fadini et al [24] also reported the prevalence of diabetes in covid-19 patients as 10.3%. our study as well as these other previous studies indicate that the prevalence of diabetes in patients with covid-19 is in the range of 10%, which is similar to the population prevalence of diabetes in the general population of china and the usa (10.9% and 11.1%, respectively) [25, 26] . thus our meta-analysis supports the previously held notion that the susceptibility of diabetic population to covid-19 infection might not be increased but be similar to the non-diabetic population [27] .the primary and the more important outcome of our meta-analysis was to study the association of diabetes with mortality and severity of covid-19 disease. we found that diabetic patients with covid-19 are twice more likely to develop severe covid-19 disease and twice more likely to die due to it (odds ratio close to 2 for severity as well as mortality). thus patients with covid-19 and diabetes are more likely to develop ards, need icu care, need invasive ventilation, and are more vulnerable to succumb to it. our results are similar to two small meta-analyses, by fadini et al (6 studies, 1687 patients) and wang et al (6 studies, 1558 patients), which gave odds ratio of 2.26 and 2.47, respectively, for diabetic patients developing more adverse disease due to sars-cov-2 infection [24, 28] . another systematic review of 7 studies by singh et al also suggested that diabetes is a determinant of severity and mortality of covid-19 patients [29] . however, our meta-analysis is the largest with 33 studies, and we have now conclusively shown the association of diabetes with covid-19 mortality as well as severity.whether diabetes is an independent determinant of severity was studied by guo et al in their case-control study from china [30] , in which they compared diabetic and non-diabetic covid-19 patients, and found that even in absence of other comorbidities, diabetics were at higher risk of severe pneumonia, uncontrolled inflammatory response, higher levels of tissue injury-related enzymes, and higher hypercoagulable state. further they found, serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as c-reactive protein, d-dimer, il-6, serum ferritin and coagulation index, were significantly higher in diabetic patients compared to those without, suggesting that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to an inflammatory storm that leads to worsening of covid-19 [30] .the pathogenesis of increased mortality and severity of covid-19 in patients with diabetes is still unclear. severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak in 202-2004 and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) outbreaks in 2012 and 2015, had also resulted in increased severity and fatality in patients with diabetes mellitus [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . all these previous outbreaks were also caused by other coronaviruses, namely sars-cov and mers-cov, respectively. to elucidate the mechanism of enhanced disease severity in diabetics following mers-cov infection, kulcsar et al [36] used an animal model in which mice were made susceptible to mers-cov infection by expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), and type 2 diabetes was induced by administering a high-fat diet. upon infection with mers-cov, diabetic mice had a prolonged phase of severe disease and delayed recovery that was independent of viral titres. histological examination revealed that diabetic mice had delayed but prolonged systemic inflammation, fewer inflammatory monocyte/macrophages and cd4+ t cells, lower levels of chemokine ligand 2 and c-x-c motif chemokine 10 expression, lower levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfα), interleukin (il) 6, il 12b, and arginase 1 expression and higher levels of il 17a expression. the data suggested that the increased disease severity observed in diabetes was likely due to a dysregulated immune response, which resulted in more severe and prolonged lung pathology [36] . since patients with diabetes have multiple immune dysregulations such as phagocytic cell dysfunction, inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, impaired t-cell mediated immune response, altered cytokine production, and ineffective microbial clearance [37] , these dysregulated immune responses may result into a cytokine profile resembling secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection, characterised by increased il 2, il 7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, monocyte chemo-attractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, and tnfα [38, 39] .in addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronavirus infection also have shared pathogenic pathways, which has therapeutic implications [40] . two of the coronavirus receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) and dpp4 are also transducers of metabolic pathways regulating glucose homeostasis, renal and cardiovascular physiology, and inflammation. dpp4 inhibitors are widely used in subjects with type 2 diabetes because of their effect of lowering blood glucose levels. however, the effects of dpp4 inhibition on the immune response in patients with diabetes is still controversial and not completely understood [41] . two recent meta-analyses had shown that dpp4 inhibitors increased the risk of various infections [42, 43] while a third meta-analysis showed that there is no increased risk of infections with dpp4 inhibitors [44] . whether dpp4 inhibitors increase the susceptibility or severity of sars-cov-2 infection needs to be studied in future trials.the results our meta-analysis has three major implications during the current covid-19 pandemic. first, since diabetes can lead to severe covid-19, its prevention in diabetics is imperative. it should be the responsibility of the treating physicians to advice their diabetic patients to take extra-precautions of social distancing and hand hygiene to protect themselves from coronavirus infection [45] . second, there should be an increased vigilance in the out-patient clinics of diabetes for covid-19, and the threshold for testing for this infection in diabetic patients should be lowered [46] . third, any patient with covid-19, who has co-morbid diabetes, should be taken as potentially serious, even though he or she may show only mild or no symptoms at presentation. these patients will need extra monitoring, and their threshold for hospital and icu admission also needs to be lowered.the results of our meta-analysis has also implications for india, which is often called the 'diabetes capital' of the world. according to the 2019 estimate, the age standardised diabetes prevalence in south-east asia, including india, among ages 20-79 years, was estimated to be 11.3% (95% ci: 8.0%-15.9%), with the actual number of people with diabetes in india being more than 77 million [25, 47] . drivers of type 2 diabetes in south asia include genetic and epigenetic factors, intrauterine and early life factors, high carbohydrate dietary patterns, and increase in physical inactivity [48] . all these factors, not only increase the prevalence of diabetes, but are also major factors in the causation of obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, with a resultant increase in morbidity and mortality. in fact, diabetes, along with cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease accounted for 4%, 27%, and 3% of deaths, respectively, in south asia [49] . during the current covid-19 pandemic, our meta-analysis, as well as multiple other studies have shown that covid-19 is particularly more severe in patients with these comorbidities with increased hospitalization, icu and ventilatory requirements [50, 51] . with the huge population burden of diabetes in india, if urgent and strong measures are not taken to flatten the curve of covid-19 pandemic in india, it will lead to disastrous consequences with overburdening of already stretched healthcare system of india. especially, elderly population of india with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac diseases will need special protection as enumerated in the preceding paragraph. their blood sugars need to be better controlled and their health condition need to be better monitored, even in the face of lockdown, through measures such as tele-consultation and tele-medicine [52] .our meta-analysis has two limitations. we have shown that diabetes is associated with covid-19 severity and mortality; however, it cannot be said whether diabetes is acting as an independent factor responsible for this severity and mortality, or it is just a confounding factor. many conditions such as elderly age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and obesity, often co-exist with diabetes, and each of these comorbidities have been shown to be associated with severe covid-19 and its mortality. in spite of this limitation, the implication our meta-analysis will remain unchanged that diabetic need to be protected from covid-19, and they will need extra care if infected. the second limitation of this metaanalysis is that we have not been able to document the role of glycemic control on the severity or mortality of covid-19. it has been shown previously that poor glycemic control, in terms of high hba1c, was significantly associated with increased risk of various infections [53, 54] . however, none of the included studies on covid-19 in our meta-analysis had evaluated glycemic control as one of the factors associated with severity and/or mortality; and this needs to be explored in further trials.in conclusion, we have shown in this meta-analysis that presence of underlying diabetes in patients with covid-19 is associated with two-fold increased risk of mortality, as well as two-fold increased risk of severity of covid-19. this necessitates enhanced prevention of covid-19 in diabetics, increased vigilance in patients of diabetes for covid-19, and a lower threshold for monitoring, hospitalization, and icu care if diabetics develop this infection. results of our meta-analysis emphasizes the need for further investigation on the pathogenic mechanism of relationship between diabetes and covid-19, and to explore its therapeutic implications.none.the authors declare that they have no conflicts of

respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) [1, 2] . the first report took place in china in 2019 and subsequently spread across the globe rapidly.as of 14 april 2020, a total of 1,844,863 confirmed infections have been reported with 117,021 deaths [3] . upon the emerging covid-19, there is no known approved, specific, effective antiviral treatment to treat this fatal disease [4] . therefore, it is of utmost urgency to identify potential therapies for sars-cov-2 infected patients [5] .as the covid-19 resemble severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) andmiddle eastern respiratory syndrome (mers) phylogenetically and symptomatically, a variety of agents have been tried according to the clinical experience from sars and mers [6, 7] . the broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin [8] , protease inhibitor lopinavir and ritonavir [9, 10] and immune up-regulator interferon [11, 12] were most commonly used. in addition, in vitro or in vivo studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [13, 14] , remdesivir [15] and arbidol [16] are effective in inhibiting viral replication in sars-associated coronavirus (cov), mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections [17] . however, the efficacy and safety of these treatments for covid-19 remains unclear [4] .few systematic reviews have previously summarized clinical trials of potential therapeutic agents for sars, mers or covid-19, resulting inconclusive outcomes [4, [18] [19] [20] [21] . herein, we conduct this review to identify the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for sars, mers besides covid-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for sars-cov-2 infected patients.the present study was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines and previously published protocol (prospero: crd42020168639).a comprehensive searching of pubmed, embase, cochrane library, china national knowledge infrastructure (cnki), china science and technology journal database (vip), and wanfang data was performed from inception to april 14th, 2020 without language restriction. unpublished trials were also identified from clinical trial registry platforms (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ and http://www.chictr.org.cn/). preprint articles were also retrieved from the websites medrxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org) and biorxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org). manual search was conducted by screening the reference lists of inclusive studies. the search strategy consisting of patient relevant terms (covid-19, middle east respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, etc.) and intervention relevant terms (lopinavir, ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, interferon, ribavirin, remdesivir, arbidol, etc.) was applied both in medical subject headings (mesh) and free text. the comprehensive search syntax was available in supplemental table 1 .two authors (z. z. and h.z.) independently screened the titles, abstracts and full-text of retrieved articles to identify their eligibility ( figure 1 ). the studies were considered for inclusion if they were randomized controlled trials (rcts), prospective cohort, or retrospective cohort studies; performed among adult patients with covid-19 or mers or sars; evaluated the efficacy and safety of anti-coronavirus agents.furthermore, the studies were considered to be excluded if they lacked a control group or target quantitative outcomes; were in vitro or in vivo studies. disagreements will be resolved by discussions with the corresponding author (z. g.). the primary outcomes of this study included mortality, virological eradication, and clinical improvement. the secondary outcomes included improvement of symptoms, time to j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f become afebrile, improvement of chest radiography results, utilization of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and adverse events (aes).data extraction was independently conducted by two authors (h. z. and z. z.) using a standardized data collection form, which included study characteristics (author, year of publication, region, study design, sample size), population characteristics (age, gender, indication), intervention characteristics (anti-coronavirus agents, dosage, duration, concomitant therapy), and outcomes (mortality, viral eradication, clinical outcomes, and aes). the risk of bias of inclusive rcts were assessed in accordance with the cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool [22] . the methodological quality assessment of prospective cohort and retrospective cohort studies were performed using the new-castle ottawa scale (nos) [23] . the risk of bias of individual study was rated as low, moderate, or high. the quality of evidence was assessed with the gradepro software and were graded as high, moderate, low, and very low [24] .dichotomous data was shown as relative risks (rr) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) and continuous variables were calculated as weight mean difference (wmd) with associated 95% cis using random-effects model, with a i 2 >50% representing notable heterogeneity [25] . subgroup analysis for treatments including hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir alone or combination, ribavirin alone or combination, arbidol and interferon were performed. to detect the robustness of the results, sensitivity analysis was conducted by sequential elimination of each study from the pool. potential publication bias was assessed using visual inspection of funnel plots when the number of included studies was more than ten. statistics were performed using stata software (version13, statacorp, college station, texas, usa), with p<0.05 indicating a statistically significant difference.the present searches totally identified 5,192 citations and excluded 5,105 publications after cautious screening of titles and abstracts. of the 87 potential studies, full-text were assessed for eligibility, 69 were excluded because they were reviews, did not contain eligible comparators, did not report outcomes of interest, were case series or others ( figure 1 ). finally, 18 articles [10, 12, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] with 4,941 patients met the inclusion criteria and were retrieved for quantitative synthesis ( table 1) .there were 5 rcts [28, 37, 38, 40, 41] and 2 prospective studies [12, 32] , whilst the remaining 11 trials were retrospective studies [10, 26, 27, 29-31, 33-36, 39] . thirteen studies were conducted in china [10, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33-38, 40, 41] , 3 in canada [12, 26, 31] , 2 in saudi arabia [29, 39] , and 1 in france [32] . there were 7 studies involving patients with covid-19 [27, 28, 32, [36] [37] [38] 40] , 9 studies involving patients with sars [10, 12, 26, 30, 31, [33] [34] [35] 41] , and 2 studies involving patients with mers [29, 39] . the interventions included arbidol (1 study) [36] , arbidol and lopinavir/ritonavir (1 study) [37] , hydroxychloroquine (4 studies) [28, 32, 37, 40] , interferon and corticosteroid (2 studies) [12, 30] , lopinavir/ritonavir (2 studies) [36, 38] , lopinavir/ritonavir plus ribavirin and corticosteroids (2 studies) [10, 35] , ribavirin (4 studies) [26, 31, 33, 41] , ribavirin and interferon (3 studies) [29, 34, 39] , ribavirin and corticosteroids (1 study) [31] ( table 1 ).the primary outcomes were mortality reported in 10 studies (4,282 patients) [10, 12, 26, 29, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 41] , virological clearance reported in 7 studies (663 patients) [27, 32, [35] [36] [37] [38] 40] , clinical improvement reported in 1 study (199 patients) [38] . the secondary outcomes were radiographical improvement reported in 2 studies (95 patients) [27, 28] , acute respiratory disease syndrome (ards) reported in 2 studies (346 patients) [35, 38] , intubation reported in 5 studies (1,494 patients) [10, 12, 26, 29, 41] , and adverse events (aes) reported in 4 studies (436 patients) [28, 37, 38, 40] , leukopenia reported in 2 studies (281 patients) [30, 38] , anemia reported in 4 studies (723 patients) [26, 34, 37, 38] , thrombocytopenia reported in 2 studies (387 patients) [34, 38] , transaminitis reported in 4 studies (633 patients) [26, 34, 37, 38] , j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f elevated total bilirubin reported in 3 studies (330 patients) [27, 34, 38] , elevated creatinine reported in 3 studies (324 patients) [36] [37] [38] , bradycardia reported in 2 studies (487 patients) [26, 33] , and diarrhea reported in 5 studies (708 patients) [35] [36] [37] [38] 40 ].considering rcts, the information of randomization was unclear in 2 studies [37, 41] , while the concealing of allocation was absent or unclear in 3 studies [37, 40, 41] .moreover, blinding of participants and the outcome assessors were absent or unclear in 4 studies [37, 38, 40, 41] (supplementary table s2 ). therefore, we decided to identify these 4 studies with risk of bias. in terms of observational studies, the nos scores were 6-9, indicating most of the studies were of low risk of bias (supplementary table s3 ).we performed a meta-analysis of the 10 studies (4,282 patients) demonstrating data on mortality when the indication was not considered [10, 12, 26, 29, 31, 34, 35, 38, 39, 41] . compared with comparators, interventions could notably reduce mortality seven studies (663 patients) documented data on virological eradication when the indication was not taken into consideration [27, 32, [35] [36] [37] [38] 40] . the pooled result j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f showed that the virological eradication ability of interventions were equal to that of comparator group (rr 1.33, 95% ci 0.97-1.81, i 2 = 89.8%). in subgroup analysis, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol, and the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and corticosteroids appeared to show a superior ability in virological eradication, generating rr of 1.77 (95% ci 1.11-2.82), rr of 2.93 (95% ci 2.24-3.82), respectively. additionally, the value of p for interaction was less than 0.01, indicating a significant difference across treatments ( there were 4 studies (313 patients) demonstrated time to become afebrile. the present of data were diversity, showing as mean±sd or medium (range), thus we could not generate a meta-analysis of this outcome. in addition, the results were controversial. on one hand, one study reported hydroxychloroquine treatment significantly shortened fever recovery time than control group 2.2±0.4 vs 3.2±1.3 [28] . on the other hand, chen et al showed hydroxychloroquine treatment observed no difference in time course to become afebrile, which is 1(0-2) vs 1(0-3) [37] .another 2 studies also documented that the lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and the combination of interferon and corticosteroids therapies had no effects on time course of defervescence compared to control therapy [30, 36] .as for radiographical improvement, the meta-analysis of 2 studies generated a rr of 1.62 (95% ci 1.11-2.36, i 2 = 11.0 %), indicating a superior ability of interventions for radiographical improvement. in subgroup analysis, the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol, and hydroxychloroquine both showed notable because of inadequate inclusive studies, we did not perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence of each included study. we did not generate funnel plot to evaluate publication bias either with the same reason.the quality of evidence is outlined in table 2 . the quality of findings relevant to mortality, virological clearance, radiographical improvement, prevalence of ards, intubation and mechanical ventilation were very low. in addition, the total aes, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, transaminitis, increased total bilirubin had very low quality of evidence as well. however, the outcome quality of clinical improvement and increased creatinine were low, while the bradycardia had a moderate quality of evidence.upon the emergency of sars-cov-2, we conducted this systematic review and metaanalysis to identify the potential therapeutic options for covid-19 based on previous studies of therapies for sars or mers. in the present review, we included 18 articles involving 4,941 patients. compared with control treatment, anti-coronavirus interventions significantly reduced mortality, notably augmented clinical improvement and radiographical improvement, without significant effect on symptoms alleviation, time to become afebrile, virologic eradication, incidence of ards, intubation, and aes.hydroxychloroquine had earned a reputation for potential promising role in covid-19 [42] . increasing number of studies had been conducted and published [28, 32, 37, 40] . recently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were demonstrated to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro (ec50=5.47%µm, ec50=0.72%µm, respectively) [32, 43] . the underlying mechanisms were inferred as follows: (1) as weakly alkaline, chloroquine could increase endosomal ph therefore block virus infection [42, 44] ; (2) as spike (s) protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) blocker, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine interfered with the glycosylation of cellular sars-cov receptor thus inhibit virus attacking [4] ; (3) as immunomodulant, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could counteract pro-inflammatory cytokine storm in critically ill patients with covid-19 [28, 45] . unfortunately, the outcomes of hydroxychloroquine [37, 40] . additionally, the hydroxychloroquine therapy improved more radiographical benefit [28] , despite accompanied with more aes especially diarrhea [40] . up to date, we could not recommend hydroxychloroquine superior to the standard care of sars-cov-2 infection, and we need to wait for larger randomized trials with target population and sensitive endpoints to valid the value of hydroxychloroquine for covid-19.as an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) protease, lopinavir/ritonavir was a major focus as it was recommended for patients with mers [27] or covid-19 [46] . it was reported lopinavir could inhibit sars-cov and mers-cov replication in vitro with ec50 at 17.1 μm and 8 μm respectively [47] . lopinavir was also found to demonstrated antiviral effect against sars-cov-2 in vero e6 cells with ec50 at 26.1 μm [48] . ritonavir had no effect against coronavirus but prolonged bioavailability of j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f lopinavir by inhibiting host's cytochrome p450 3a4 enzyme [49] . five studies had reported the effectiveness and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir alone or combination therapy. lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with ribavirin and corticosteroids did not show any mortality benefit. however, lopinavir/ritonavir-based treatments had observed inconsistent results of virological clearance with rr of between 0.97-2.93.lopinavir/ritonavir alone was revealed ineffective in lowering virus load of sars-cov-2 [36, 38] , while the lopinavir/ritonavir accompanying with arbidol or ribavirin augmented the eradication of sars-cov-2 [27, 35, [47] [48] [49] . it was speculated that lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg) twice daily may reach the minimal lopinavir serum concentration at 9.4 μm (7.2-12.1 μm), which was inadequate for inhibition of sars-cov-2 [50] . nevertheless, lopinavir/ritonavir accompanied with the other agents showing effects against sars-cov-2 might decrease the inhibitory concentration of lopinavir and produce synergy [48] . furthermore, lopinavir/ritonavirbased therapies documented notably better clinical and radiographical improvement and reduced incidence of ards or intubation. take adverse reactions into consideration, most of the aes rate were comparable between groups. conversely, lopinavir/ritonavir alone showed tendency of more diarrhea events, while the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and corticosteroids reduced incidence of diarrhea significantly. it was suspected that lopinavir/ritonavir alone did not show demonstrably beneficial effects for covid-19, but the lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might play roles in the eradication of sars-cov-2 [21] .the most extensively used therapies were ribavirin and ribavirin-based combinations.ribavirin was reported to tightly bind to sars-cov-2 rna dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) with binding energy of -7.8 kcal/mol, and thus may be used to against covid-19 [51] . there were 9 studies reporting sars and mers patients treated with ribavirin or combinations with ribavirin. the meta-analysis yielded inconsistent results for mortality with rr of between 0.38 and 0.82, while the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids showed remarkable lower mortality j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f compared with control group. in addition, patients treated with ribavirin-based therapies showed comparable rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation with control group. of note, the major problem of ribavirin was significantly higher incidence of adverse events especially bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis compared with control group. intriguingly, the combination of ribavirin and interferon did not observe these problems. summarily, as the inconsistent benefit, considerable safety concerns, and very low quality of evidence, it was hard to make a clear recommendation for the use of ribavirin and ribavirin-based combinations for covid-19.it was revealed that arbidol had in vitro antiviral activity in early replication stage of sars-cov [52] . however, the arbidol alone generated equivalent outcome in patients with covid-19 compared with control group, while the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir showed better efficacy [27] . furthermore, interferon had been widely used through sars and mers epidemic [18] , and there were 5 studies reported combinations with interferon. unfortunately, no difference was noted between treatment and control group in terms of mortality, intubation rate, and adverse reactions. the recommendation of these treatments was uncertain because of the small sample size of study and other risk of low quality [12, 27, 36] .firstly, to best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis capability than other anti-coronavirus agents. conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concern especially bradycardia.currently, growing trials related to anti-coronavirus agents were ongoing, including the lopinavir/ritonavir as initial therapy was associated with lower mortality compared with matched cohorts. the lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy observed no difference in mortality, compared with matched cohorts.the lopinavir/ritonavir as initial therapy was associated with lower rate of incubation and use of corticosteroids at a reduced dose compared with matched cohorts. the lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy observed no difference in rates of intubation and oxygen desaturation compared with matched cohorts.c oronavirus disease 2019 is caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). confirmed cases of covid-19 are growing rapidly with spread to 188 countries and regions (1) . the number of reported mortalities worldwide is more than 435,000 predicting a case-fatality rate of approximately 3.4% (2) . based on data from other centers, covid-19 often results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) with the leading cause of death in covid-19 positive (+) patients being respiratory failure with or without multiple organ dysfunction (i.e., cardiac and/or renal) (3) (4) (5) (6) . currently, there are no specific therapies for covid-19, and patients are provided only supportive care.recent reports and commentaries have suggested that the severity of covid-19 may be due to a "cytokine storm" (7) , which is the excessive or uncontrolled release of cytokines in response to a pathologic event, such as a viral infection (8) . these suggestions are due to increased inflammatory cytokine levels, such as interleukin-6 (il-6), as well as fever, cytopenia, and hyperferritinemia (4, 9) . moreover, these commentaries have been accompanied by calls for the use of broad immunosuppression with steroids, iv immunoglobulin, and/or selective cytokine blockade as a therapeutic approach for covid-19 (8, 10) . while patient mortality could be improved with immunosuppressive therapies, the evidence for changes in specific cytokines is incomplete, and often observed at a single timepoint with limited comparison to control groups (4, 9) . additionally, as described in recent commentaries and reviews, the use of immunosuppressive therapies to treat critically ill patients, including those with ards, has often been challenging due to the potential to cause harm highlighting the need for rigorous data to support any proposed trials (11, 12) .the overall aim of this study was to characterize the inflammatory profile of critically ill covid-19 patients over the first 7 days of icu stay to potentially identify therapeutic targets. our specific objectives were 1) to determine the inflammatory analytes changing between covid-19+ icu patients and healthy controls; 2) to determine the inflammatory analyte differences between covid-19+ and covid-19 negative (−) icu patients; and 3) to determine the changes in relevant inflammatory analytes over time in covid-19+ icu patients.this study was approved by the western university, human research ethics board. we enrolled consecutive patients who were admitted to our level-3 academic icu at london health sciences centre-victoria campus (london, ontario) and were suspected of having covid-19 based on standard hospital screening procedures (13) . we collected daily blood samples starting at admission and up to 3 days in covid-19− patients, or up to 7 days in covid-19+ patients. covid-19 status was confirmed as part of standard hospital testing by detection of two sars-cov-2 viral genes using polymerase chain reaction (14). patient baseline characteristics were recorded at admission and included age, sex, comorbidities, laboratory values, arterial partial pressure to inspired oxygen (p/f) ratio, and chest radiograph findings. although icu severity of illness scores have not been validated in covid-19+ patients, we calculated multiple organ dysfunction score (mods) and sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score for both covid-19+ and covid-19− patient groups to enable objective comparison of their illness severity. we also categorized both patient groups as having confirmed or suspected sepsis diagnosis using sepsis 3.0 criteria. clinical interventions received during the observation period were included and consisted of antibiotics, antiviral agents, systemic corticosteroids, vasoactive medications, renal replacement therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation (invasive and noninvasive). final participant groups were constructed by age-and sex-matching covid-19+ icu patients with covid-19− icu patients, as well as healthy controls that had blood samples previously banked in the translational research centre, london, on, canada) (directed by dr. d. d. fraser; https://translationalresearchcentre.com/) (15, 16) .standard operating procedures were used to ensure all samples were treated rapidly and equally. blood was obtained via indwelling catheters daily in the morning and placed immediately on ice. once transferred to a negative pressure hood, blood was centrifuged and plasma isolated, aliquoted at 250 µl and frozen at −80°c. all samples remained frozen until use and freeze/thaw cycles were avoided.levels of 57 inflammatory analytes were determined using multiplexed biomarker immunoassay kits according to manufacturers' instructions (milliporesigma, 400 summit drive, burlington, ma) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). for the former, plasma inflammatory analytes were measured using a bio-plextm 200 suspension array system (bio-rad laboratories, hercules, ca), which used luminex xmaptm fluorescent bead-based technology (luminex corp, austin, tx). bioanalyte concentrations were calculated from standard curves using five-parameter logistic regression in bio-plex manager 6.1 software. for the latter, plasma levels of timp1 (r&d systems duo set #dy970-05, diluted 1:100 or 1:200), timp2 (r&d systems duo set #dy971, diluted 1:100), and timp3 (r&d systems duo set #dy973, diluted 1:3 or 1:4) were measured with elisa.medians (interquartile ranges [iqrs]) and frequency (%) were used to report icu patient baseline characteristics for continuous and categorical variables, respectively; continuous variables were compared using mann-whitney u tests (or kruskal-wallis tests, as appropriate), and categorical variables were compared using fisher exact chi-square, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. daily analyte concentrations were also reported as medians (iqrs), and comparisons between groups were examined using mann-whitney u tests. given the number of analytes analyzed and the risk of false positives, a p value of < 0.01 was used as our standard for statistical significance. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were conducted to determine sensitivity and specificity of all continuous variables for predicting mortality. the area-under-the-curve (auc) was calculated for each variable, and the coordinates of the curves were then analyzed to identify the cutoff values based on the highest sensitivity and specificity for predicting mortality. all analyses were conducted using spss version 26 (ibm corp., armonk, ny).covid-19 analyte data were visualized with a nonlinear dimensionality reduction on the full data matrix using the t-distributed stochastic nearest neighbor embedding (t-sne) algorithm (17) . t-sne assumes that the "optimal" representation of the data lies on a manifold with complex geometry, but low dimension, embedded in the full dimensional space of the raw data. for feature selection, we pooled analyte data across 1-3 icu days for each of the covid-19+ and covid-19− cohorts and normalized observations within analyte. a random forest classifier was trained on the variables to predict covid-19 status. a random forest is a set of decision trees and, consequently, we were able to interrogate this collection of trees to identify the features that have the highest predictive value (viz., those features that frequently appear near the top of the decision tree). we limited the decision trees to a maximum depth of five levels and constrained the forest to 50 trees to avoid overfitting the small dataset. we further explored the ability to perform automated classification of covid-19+ versus covid-19− patients from their analyte spectra, conservatively employing only a single decision tree and limiting the maximum tree depth to three levels. we trained and tested the classifier using a five-fold cross-validation approach.we investigated 10 covid-19+ icu patients (median years of age = 61.0; iqr = 54.8-67.0), 10 age-and sex-matched covid-19− icu patients (median years of age = 58.0; iqr = 52.5-63.0), and 10 age-and sex-matched healthy controls (median years of age = 57.5; iqr = 52.8-62.8; p = 0.686). baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and chest radiograph findings are reported in table 1 . covid-19-icu patients had significantly higher unilateral pneumonia, whereas covid-19+ icu patients were more likely to have bilateral pneumonia. sepsis was confirmed by infectious pathogen identification in only 20% of covid-19-icu patients, while sepsis was suspected in the remaining 80%. all other reported baseline measures were nonsignificant between patients, although a mortality rate of 40% was determined for covid-19+ icu patients.we measured 57 inflammatory analytes in plasma using either fluorescent bead-based multiplex technology or elisa. table 2 shows that 20 inflammatory analytes were significantly different between covid-19+ icu patients and healthy controls (the remaining 37 nonsignificant analytes are shown in supplemental table 1 , supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/ ccx/a209). all significantly different analytes were elevated in covid-19+ icu patients relative to healthy controls except mmp2 that was decreased.covid-19+ and covid-19− cohorts were then plotted in two dimensions following dimensionality reduction by stochastic neighbor embedding (fig. 1a) . the dimensionality reduction shows that the daily analyte measurements (icu days 1-3) between the two cohorts were distinct and easily separable. to determine which analytes were most informative for covid-19 status classification, we performed feature selection with a random forest classifier. the top six features were identified for the binary outcome of covid-19+ versus covid-19− in the following order: tumor necrosis factor (tnf), granzyme b, heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), interleukin-18 (il-18), interferon-gammainducible protein 10 (ip-10), and elastase 2 (fig. 1b) . we then trained and tested a simple decision-tree classifier that yielded a classifier accuracy, or the ability of the analytes to predict covid-19 status, of 98% (p < 0.001, five-fold cross-validation).supplemental table 2 (supplemental digital content 2, http:// links.lww.com/ccx/a210) lists 17 inflammatory analytes that were significantly different between covid-19+ and covid-19patients on any or all of icu days 1-3 (the remaining 40 nonsignificant analytes for icu days 1-3 are shown in supplemental table  3 , supplemental digital content 3, http://links.lww.com/ccx/ a211). all significant analytes were elevated in covid-19+ icu patients relative to covid-19-icu patients. while many analytes were significantly different between covid-19+ and covid-19− patients over time, the top six analytes determined by feature classification over icu days 1-3 are listed first, and were tnf, granzyme b, hsp70, and il-18; ip-10 and elastase 2 were also significantly different between covid-19+ and covid-19− patients, but starting on icu day 2. a time course for these six markers is shown in figure 2 the feature matrix for day 1 covid-19+ icu patients was classified for mortality using a random forest classifier (1,000 trees) and three-fold cross-validation. as hsp70 was the leading analyte associated with covid-19+ death, a roc curve was then conducted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of hsp70 for predicting mortality. the auc for hsp70 was 1.00, indicating perfect sensitivity and specificity for our 10 covid-19+ icu patients. using youden's index, the hsp70 cutoff value for predicting mortality was >264,380 pg/ml. of note, with the addition of the 10 covid-19− cases to the analysis, the auc and the cutoff for hsp70 remained the same.in this study, we measured 57 inflammatory analytes in plasma obtained from icu patients, both covid-19+ and covid-19−, as well as age-and sex-matched healthy controls. given the number of analytes measured, we used two complimentary methods to analyze the data, conventional population statistics and machine learning. our data indicate the presence of a unique inflammatory profile characterized by early and sustained elevations in circulating tnf, granzyme b, hsp70, and il-18. circulating levels of ip-10 increased transiently on icu days 2-3 and elastase 2 was consistently elevated on icu days 2-7. finally, the plasma levels of hsp70 in covid-19+ icu patients were associated with mortality. despite the exploratory nature of our study, the data generated suggest that these six inflammatory analytes could be considered for further investigation as potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets. while changes in some potentially useful inflammatory analytes were not identified in our study, larger cohorts will be necessary to elucidate their role in the host response (i.e., il-6 required 47 patients per cohort to reach statistical significance based on 80% power and an alpha = 0.01). our covid-19+ icu patients were similar to those reported in earlier cohorts from china (4, 5), seattle (3), and italy (6) with respect to age, comorbidities, and clinical presentation. in contrast to covid-19− icu patients, and in keeping with findings from the seattle cohort, our covid-19+ icu patients had a higher prevalence of bilateral pneumonia. covid-19− icu patients had higher illness severity scores than covid-19+ icu patients, although these differences were not statistically significant due to our small sample size. given that ventilated covid-19+ icu patients are reported to have higher mortality (18) than comparable ards cohorts (19) , and that mods and sofa scores have not been validated in covid-19+ icu patients, the lower median mods and sofa scores in these patients may not accurately represent their illness severity relative to the covid-19− icu patients. indeed, mortality was 40% in our covid-19+ icu patients, whereas all covid-19− icu patients survived to discharge.compared with healthy controls, covid-19+ icu patients exhibit clinical and laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation. increased circulating cytokine levels (e.g., tnf, il-6, il-8, and il-10), together with lymphopenia (in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells), characterize the purported "cytokine storm" associated with severe covid-19. the mediator release pattern has been compared with that seen in secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a hyperinflammatory syndrome commonly triggered by viral infections, and in a small percentage of severe sepsis patients, characterized by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiple organ failure. however, when compared with covid-19− icu patients, the covid-19+ icu patients exhibited a pattern of cytokine elevation that was unique from previous reports in that elevations were sustained and dominated by tnf and the serine proteases granzyme b and elastase 2. these latter findings may be of particular clinical relevance as preclinical models suggest sars-cov-2 entry into cells may be blocked by protease inhibitors (20) .in contrast to other studies of sepsis and ards, we found persistently elevated levels of circulating tnf in our covid-19+ icu patients, a potent acute master regulator of the proinflammatory response. tnf is typically upregulated quickly and early following exposure to an invading pathogen or to tissue damage, after which secondary mediators propagate inflammation while circulating levels of tnf quickly normalize (21, 22) . the persistently elevated levels of tnf in covid-19+ icu patients could be a potential target for anti-tnf therapy with either neutralizing antibodies or small molecule inhibitors (10) .granzyme b is expressed specifically in the cytolytic granules of natural killer cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes, and functions as a targeted cell death mediator traditionally considered to cause apoptosis of tumor and virally infected cells (23) . extracellular soluble granzyme b levels are elevated in autoimmune diseases and infections including the human endotoxemia model and in those with severe sepsis (24) . furthermore, granzyme b retains much of its proteolytic activity when exposed to plasma. granzyme b can degrade several extracellular membrane components and is involved in the production, release, and/or processing of proinflammatory cytokines (25, 26) . granzyme b activates il-18 through cleavage of pro-il-18 (27, 28) , which in turn promotes cellular apoptosis via induction of granzyme b. activation of il-18 also induces synthesis and release of the antiviral response mediator's interferon-gamma (ifnγ). moreover, il-18 is known to increase adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells, both icam1 and vcam1, thereby increasing microvascular leukocyte adhesion (29) .hsp70 was elevated in our covid-19 icu patients and associated with mortality. as a chaperone protein that is induced in response to environmental, physical, and chemical stresses, hsp70 is usually cytoprotective by limiting the consequences of damage and by facilitating cellular recovery via caspase inhibition. conversely, hsp70 can also exacerbate the stress response, signaling tissue destruction, and aid in immunosurveillance by transporting intracellular peptides to distant immune cells (30) . extracellular hsp70 also promotes inflammation by activating toll-like receptors and promoting entry of granzyme b into the cells initiating cellular apoptosis (23, 31) . interestingly, hsp70 is part of the receptor complex that interacts with the binding domain of the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus, a member of the family coronaviridae, enabling viral entry into lung and kidney cells (32) .ip-10 is an inflammatory chemokine released by monocytes and endothelial cells, which aids recruitment of activated t cells into sites of tissue inflammation. either protecting or promoting infection, the actions of ip-10 depend on host immune status and genetic background (33) . previous studies suggest that ip-10 is protective in coronavirus-induced severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) (34, 35) , whereas others have shown improved infectious disease outcomes after blocking ip-10 with neutralizing antibodies (33) .elastase 2 is also a serine protease that slowly increases in covid-19+ icu patients over 7 icu days. neutrophil azurophilic granules, as well as monocytes/macrophages and mast cells, contain elastase 2 (36) . upon degranulation, elastase 2 is either released into circulation or mobilized to the leukocyte plasma membranes and subsequently deposited to vascular endothelium or subendothelial spaces (37, 38) . in covid-19+ icu patients, elevated elastase 2 levels may contribute to increased pulmonary vascular permeability and injury. elevated elastase 2 has been demonstrated under various severe inflammatory conditions and can contribute to the development of ards (39) .our exploratory study has identified a unique pattern of inflammation in covid-19+ icu patients that could be considered for further study as biomarkers and/or therapeutic targeting (hypothesis-generating data); however, our study also has several limitations. first, we only studied critically ill patients and we cannot determine the inflammatory changes contributing to icu admissions. second, given the limited number of patients available for study, we used two complimentary methods to independently analyze our data and both methods arrived at similar conclusions. third, our covid-19 study population was relatively small; however, we still generated strongly significant data (e.g., true positives) and fulfilled an urgent need for exploratory data to focus future hypothesis-driven studies on larger cohorts. finally, we report only mortality as a clinical outcome. future studies with larger sample sizes can explore whether reported changes in inflammatory analytes correlate with additional clinical outcomes such as functional status in survivors.in summary, we report sustained elevations in a unique combination of inflammatory analytes in covid-19+ icu patients. our exploratory data are consistent with the slow, or absent improvement in covid-19+ patients despite state-of-the-art icu care, and could aid future hypothesis-driven research using larger icu cohorts.www.ccejournal.org 2020 • volume 2 • e0144 supplemental digital content is available for this article. direct url citations appear in the html and pdf versions of this article on the journal's website (http://journals.lww.com/ccejournal).the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has caused significant morbidity and mortality to date, with the number of new cases and deaths continue to rise at an alarming rate 1 . although most cases of covid-19 are asymptomatic or mild in severity, a minority of patients experience more severe symptoms of covid-19 along with its complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), coagulopathy, multiple organ failure (mof), and death. a number of comorbidities have been associated with an increased risk of severity and mortality in covid-19 patients, including hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . individuals with preexisting cardiovascular diseases have been shown to have poor outcomes with covid 19 7, 8 . study from chinese center of disease control on 72314 cases reported a case fatality rate of 10.5% for patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, but no specific data on mortality on heart failure. 9 due to looming possibility of poor drug compliance and other complications related to disruption in medical services, the number of patients with new or decompensated heart failure may increase. 10 currently, the plausible mechanisms for sars-cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome 2) to infect human cells include binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor and inducing hyperinflammation or cytokine storm. a high expression of ace2 receptor is commonly found in patients with heart failure 7, 8 . in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we wanted to investigate the association between heart failure with poor outcome in patients with covid-19.we performed a systematic search of the literature on pubmed, europepmc, scopus, cochrane central database, and medrxiv for preprint studies with the search terms, "heart failure" and "covid-19". after the removal of duplicates, the abstracts were screened by two independent authors (ey and rp). irrelevant articles were excluded. the inclusion criteria for this study were studies that studied patients with preexisting hf comorbidity with covid-19 infection. the outcome of interest was mortality and poor prognosis (defined by incidence of severe covid-19 infection, admission to icu, and use of ventilator) in patients with preexisting heart failure with coronavirus disease.this systematic search conforms to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma).data extraction was carried out by ey, rp, mal, and ih using a standardized form containing the following details: author name, year of publication, study design, and sample size.this meta-analysis was conducted using review manager (revman) v5.3 (cochrane collaboration) software. hazard ratio (hr) and odds ratio (or) with 95% confidence interval (ci) were used as pooled measures for dichotomous data. heterogeneity was assessed using inconsistency index (i2) ranging from 0-100%. statistically significant heterogeneity was defined as an i 2 value above 50% or p< 0.05. the mantel -haenszel method was used to determine or, and the generic inverse variance method was used to determine hr. random effects models were implemented for analyses with significant heterogeneity. sensitivity analyses were done to test statistical robustness of pooled results, to see whether there is significant change in pooled results by exclusion of studies, and to j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f single out studies with high heterogeneity. meta-analysis of prevalence were done by pooling of events of hf per total patients using the meta-analysis of proportion. small-study effects and the risk of publication bias were assessed qualitatively using funnel plot analysis and quantitatively using regression-based egger's testwe extracted 204 potential articles from our search, and 22 duplicates were removed. after the titles and abstracts of the remaining 182 articles were screened we obtained 92 potentially relevant articles. we excluded 74 studies due to the following reasons: four studies were systematic reviews, two studies were meta-analyses, three articles were literature reviews, and 65 articles did not report on the outcome of interest. finally, we included the remaining 18 studies in our qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. there were 21640 patients from 18 studies. the majority of study subjects are males ranging from 54.7% to 85%, with only two studies reported male subjects being minorities, (45 three studies reported a statistically significant difference in the risk of hospitalization in covid19 patients with preexisting heart failure. seven studies reported a statistically significant difference in mortality between patients with covid-19 with and without preexisting hf. three studies reported a statistically significant difference in incidence of new-onset hf in hospitalized patients with covid- 19 (figure 6) sixteen studies were available for meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence of heart failure among patients with covid-19; the meta-analysis revealed a pooled prevalence of heart failure of 9% (7-12%). (figure 7) regression-based egger's test showed no indication of small-study effects for heart failure and poor outcome (p=0.852), pooled hr of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with preexisting heart failure (p=0.640), and comparison of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 accompanied with preexisting heart failure and without heart failure (p=0.555). there was an indication of small-study effects for risk of hospitalization in patients with preexisting heart failure (p=0.035) and incidence of new-onset heart failure (p<0.001). the number of included studies were <10 for risk of hospitalization in patients with preexisting heart failure, pooled hr of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with preexisting heart failure, and incidence new onset heart failure, thus, the results were less reliable. analysis using funnel plot generated asymmetrical result for heart failure and poor outcome ( figure 8a ), and comparison of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 accompanied with preexisting heart failure and without heart failure ( figure 8b ), with figure 8a showing somewhat less asymmetry compared to figure 8b . based on cochrane collaboration recommendation we only performed funnel plot analysis in meta-analysis involving more than 10 studies.in this meta-analysis, we observed an association between hf and poor outcome in patients with covid-19, a higher risk of death and hospitalization in those with preexisting hf, and higher mortality in those with preexisting hf compared to patients without hf.as with other types of pneumonia, preexisting cardiovascular diseases, including hf, are risk factors for poor prognosis during and after the course of pneumonia. 11 the effect of an infective organism on the myocardium can cause non-ischemic cardiac injury. the systemic inflammatory response, which is particularly excessively elevated in covid-19, can also result in kidney injury and impair sodium and water metabolism, which may precipitate the worsening of hf. 12 recent studies on the role of ace2 in covid-19 infection have reported that ace2 levels are 50% higher in male patients with hf. [13] [14] [15] this finding explains the higher risk of poor prognosis, hospitalization, and death in this population in the event of occurrence of covid-19. in this metaanalysis, the majority of the studies had higher number of male patients than female patients.in patients with coexisting hf and diabetes, who are in a pro-inflammatory state, the membranebound ace2 protein can be cleaved by adam17, resulting in the release of ace2 into the interstitium and blood circulation. 16 this inflammatory response, which occurs in covid-19 as an elevated immune response 17, 18 might also explain the increase in mortality in patients with covid-19 accompanied with hf. the excessive inflammatory response and oxidative stress in these patients predispose them to a more severe clinical course of covid-19. 19 this phenomenon is particularly significant in patients with preexisting hf since these patients suffer from decreased circulatory and physiological reserves. older patients with hf commonly suffer from multiple comorbidities, deterioration in function of multiple organ systems, and functional decline. 20,21 ace2 is an enzyme involved in the raas pathway; however, it differs from ace in not being capable of converting angiotensin i into angiotensin ii. furthermore, as opposed to the vasoconstrictor property of angiotensin type 1 receptors, ace2 via the ace-2 receptors cleaves angiotensin ii into angiotensin 1-7, which has vasodilatory properties. 22 based on these explanations, it is easy for us to conclude regarding the dangers of upregulation of ace2 as in patients being treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers (rasb). one study has even proposed ceasing administration of rasb in patients with covid-19 on these drugs. 23 however, this does not seem to be the case, and several other authors have questioned this hypothesis. [24] [25] [26] [27] the rationale for this rebuttal is based upon several in vitro studies, which revealed that upon entry into alveolar cells using membrane-bound ace-2 receptors, sars-cov-2 downregulates the expression and causes internalization of ace2 receptors. the result of this process is a decrease in angiotensin-ii to angiotensin (1-7) conversion and an increase in the availability of angiotensin ii to bind to the at1 receptor. this induces cellular inflammation, oxidative stress, vasoconstriction, fibrosis, and aldosterone activation, which may eventually lead to lung injury. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] the use of rasb may serve as a protective measure against lung injury by the inhibition of angiotensin ii synthesis using aceis and blockade of at1r by arbs. this would result in a skew of the raas towards angiotensin (1-7) and its subsequent interaction with mas-receptors, which may minimize the risk of lung injury. 29, 33 the result of this meta-analysis is similar to that of previous studies in which patients with preexisting heart hf demonstrated an elevated risk of poor outcome, hospitalization, and death [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . 34 35-41 42-50 51,52 compared to other diseases, based on our pooled results, patients with hf suffering from sars-cov-2 infection have a threefold increased risk of in-hospital mortality compared to patients with hf who develop influenza, or 3.46 [2.52, 4. studies have shown a poorer prognosis in patients with hf who develop influenza. 53, 54 as a result of the decreased physiological reserve, influenza virus infection in patients with hf is associated with a severe course and significant hemodynamic compromise, which often requires cardiac support. 56 influenza vaccination in these patients is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, furthermore receiving >1 influenza vaccine is associated with 18% reduction in both all-cause and cardiovascular death (all-cause death: 0.82; 95% ci,0.81-0.84; p<0.001; cardiovascular death: 0.82; 95% ci, 0.81-0.84; p<0.001), in the event of influenza infection, patients with heart failure may fail to cope with the increased metabolic demand which is caused by the infection itself, as a result, decompensation or exacerbation in heart failure symptoms may occur. 57 j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f patients with hf are currently classified as a high-priority group to be vaccinated with the influenza vaccine. 58 based on these findings, once an effective vaccine for sars-cov-2 infection becomes available, patients with hf should be prioritized to be vaccinated even in case of covid-19.we observed some limitations of this meta-analysis, such as the use of preprint studies included in this meta-analysis. additionally, several studies have been conducted in the same cities/regions, posing a risk of subject overlap. data regarding the difference between new-onset and worsening of hf in patients in the studies was rarely available. data regarding staging of hf was also rarely found. additionally, in patients with hf suffering from a severe course of covid-19 infection, data regarding the use of vasopressors and inotropic agents as well as the incidence of cardiogenic shock was lacking.in conclusion, patients with hf are at increased risk for poor outcomes such as hospitalization, and death from covid-19. a significant difference in mortality between patients with and without hf was observed, those with hf showing higher mortality rates. these findings probably stem from the reduced physiological reserves in patients with hf. mortality of patients with hf accompanied with sars-cov-2 infection is higher than that of patients with influenza, but lower than that of patients with mers-cov. thus, if sars-cov-2 vaccine becomes available, patients with hf should be prioritized to be vaccinated.j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f journal pre-proof j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f in late 2019, a novel form of coronavirus, named sars-cov-2 (stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), started spreading in the province of hubei in china, and claimed numerous human lives [1] - [3] . in january 2020, the world health organization (who) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (pheic) [4] [5] . in february 2020, who selected an official name, covid-19 (stands for coronavirus disease 2019), for the infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and later in march 2020 declared a covid-19 pandemic [5] [6] .coronavirus is a family of viruses that usually causes respiratory tract disease and infections that can be fatal in some cases such as in sars, mers, and covid-19. some kinds of coronavirus can affect animals, and sometimes, on rare occasions, coronavirus jumps from animal species into the human population. the novel coronavirus might have jumped from an animal species into the human population, and then begun spreading [7] . a recent study has shown that once the coronavirus outbreak starts, it will take less than four weeks to overwhelm the healthcare system. once the hospital capacity gets overwhelmed, the death rate jumps [8] .artificial intelligence (ai) has been shown to be an effective tool in predicting medical conditions and adverse events, and help caregivers with medical decision-making [9] - [13] . in this study, we proposed a data-driven predictive analytics algorithm based on artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning to determine the health risk and predict the mortality risk of patients with covid-19. the developed system can help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. the algorithm predicts the mortality risks based on patients' physiological conditions, symptoms, and demographic information.the proposed system includes a set of algorithms for preprocessing the data to extract new features, handling missing values, eliminating redundant and useless data elements, and selecting the most informative features. after preprocessing the data, we use machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model to classify the data, predict the medical condition, and calculate the probability and risk of mortality.the rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section ii, we will introduce the different methods and model architecture. discuss each method by providing detailed information about the model, data preprocessing, and challenges that we encountered and the steps to mitigate these challenges, feature selection, and feature extraction. in section iii, describe the results and conclusion.in this paper, we used a dataset of more than 117,000 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients from 76 countries around the world including both male and female patients with an average age of 56.6 [3] . the disease confirmed by detection of virus nucleic acid [3] . the original dataset contained 32 data elements from each patient, including demographic and physiological data. at the data cleaning stage, we removed useless and redundant data elements such as data source, admin id, and admin name. then, data imputation techniques were used to handle missing values.after analyzing the data, we found out that 74% of patients were recovered from covid-19. to have an accurate and unbiased model, we made sure that our dataset is balanced. a balanced dataset with equal observations for both recovered and deceased patients was created to train and test our model. the data observations (patients) in the training dataset have been selected randomly and they are completely separate from the testing data. figure 1 shows a high-level architecture of our system. the outcome label contained multiple values for the patient's health status. we considered patient that discharged from hospital or patients in stable situation with no more symptoms as recovered patients.a total of 80 features were extracted from symptoms and doctors' medical notes about the patient's health status.we also extracted additional 32 features from patient's demographic and physiological data, made it to total 112 features. we consulted with a medical team to make sure that the best features are extracted and selected. the next step is feature selection. the primary purpose of feature selection is to find the most informative features and eliminate redundant data to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the model [11] . we used univariate and multivariate filter method and wrapper method to rank the features and select the best feature subset [11] . figure 2 demonstrates the steps of filter and wrapper method that we used for feature selection. filter methods are very popular (especially for large datasets) since they are usually very fast and much less computationally intensive than wrapper methods. filter methods use a specific metric to score each individual feature (or a subset of features together). the most popular metrics used in filter methods include correlation coefficient, fisher score, mutual information, entropy and consistency and chisquare parameters [11] .after applying different filter and wrapper methods, we chose 42 features out of 112 features. our final feature set includes demographic features such as age, sex, province, country, age, travel history, general medical information such as comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, … ), and also patient symptoms such as chest pain, chills, colds, conjunctivitis, cough, diarrhea, discomfort, dizziness, dry cough, dyspnea, emesis, expectoration, eye irritation, fatigue, gasp, headache, lesions on chest radiographs, little sputum, malaise, muscle pain, myalgia, obnubilation, pneumonia, myelofibrosis, respiratory symptoms, rhinorrhea, somnolence, sputum, transient fatigue, weakness, etc. figure 3 shows the correlation heatmap for dataset features. figure 3-(a) shows the correlation between features and the outcome i.e. mortality risk, and figure 3-(b) shows the correlation between features. as figure 3-(a) after selecting the best feature subset, we used various machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. in this research, we used different algorithms including support vector machine (svm), neural networks, random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbor (knn) [15] [16] [17] . the neural network algorithm achieved the best performance and accuracy. we used grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the neural network. the best neural network results were achieved with two hidden layers with 10 neurons in the first layer and 3 neurons in the second layer. we used sigmoid function as the hidden layer activation function and used stochastic gradient optimizer, constant learning rate and the regularization rate of alpha = 0.01. the svm model was configured with linear kernel, and regularization parameter c=1.0. the random forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method combined of multiple decision tree predictors that are trained based on random data samples and feature subsets [17] . we configured the random forest algorithm with 20 trees in the forest.we used 10-fold random cross-validation (with no overlap, with no replacement) to evaluate the developed model. we calculated the overall accuracy for all machine learning algorithms to compare. also, we generated receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves for every algorithm, and calculated the area under curve (auc) and confusion matrix. again, we made sure that there is no overlap (no common patient) between training and testing datasets at any level. the next section will provide the results and performance of the developed system.the purpose of this study is to create a predictive algorithm to help hospitals and medical facilities maximize the number of survivors by providing an accurate and reliable tool to help medical decision making and triage covid-19 patients more effectively and accurately during the pandemic.as explained in section ii, several metrics such as accuracy, roc, auc, and confusion matrix have been used to evaluate the developed model. table 1 demonstrates the prediction accuracy for predicting mortality in patients with covid-19 using 10-fold cross-validation for various machine learning algorithms.table1. the accuracy of mortality prediction in patients with covid-19 using 10-fold cross-validation. figure 4 demonstrates and compares the roc curves and auc for every machine learning algorithm that was used in this research. the results demonstrate that the developed algorithm is able to accurately predict the mortality risk in patients with covid-19 based on the patients' physiological conditions, symptoms, and demographic information. figure 6 shows the mortality risk predicted by the algorithm for sample patients. . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international

.strated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% ci, 0.942-0.990) than sequential organ failure assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% ci, 0.808-0.926) and curb65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% ci, 0.784-0.905). based on the cut-off value of 17, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. kaplan-meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score greater than or equal to 17 (p < 0.001). conclusions: acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with sequential organ failure assessment score and curb65 score. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions. (crit care med 2020; xx:00-00) key words: acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score; coronavirus disease 2019; mortality; risk factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 i n december 2019, a cluster of acute pneumonia infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), now known as coronavirus disease 2019 , occurred in wuhan, china (1) (2) (3) . the disease has rapidly spread throughout china and many other countries. a total of 79,251 cases and 2,835 deaths have been reported in china, whereas 4,767 cases and 68 deaths have been reported in 53 countries and regions outside china by february 28, 2020 . the mortality of hospitalized patients was 4.3-11% (4, 5) . the 28-day mortality of the critical patients was reported to be 61.5%, which was considerable (6) . covid-19 has emerged as a major global health threat; however, no clinical scoring system was reported to identify patients with a potentially unfavorable prognosis quickly.during the clinical practice of patients' treatment, we observed that some patients rapidly deteriorated, developing respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), and even multiple organ failure, leading to death. evaluation of various organ functions may predict the mortality of patients with covid-19. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score and sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score are commonly used to assess disease severity and estimate hospital mortality in general critical illnesses (7, 8) . confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, age 65 (curb65) score is commonly used to assess the severity and mortality of pneumonia (9). these scoring system may also be used to assess the mortality of covid-19.in this study, we aimed to describe the difference of epidemiologic and clinical characteristics between survivors and deaths, and we attempt to provide an effective clinical tool to predict the probability of death among patients with covid-19.this single-center, retrospective study was done at tongji hospital. tongji hospital, located in wuhan, hubei province, the endemic areas of covid-19, is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals and is responsible for the treatments for patients with severe covid-19 assigned by the government. we recruited inpatients cared in the icu from january 10, 2020, to february 10, 2020, who have been diagnosed as covid-19, according to world health organization interim guidance (10) . laboratory confirmation of covid-19 was performed by the local health authority as previously described (11) . data of the patients were achieved by reviewing the admission logs and histories from all available electronic medical records and patient care resources. the patients were followed up to february 25, 2020. this study was approved by the ethics commission of tongji hospital (tj-irb20200225).data extraction was performed by physicians using a standardized form to collect data about demographic characteristics, exposure history to huanan seafood market, delay time from illness onset to hospitalization, underlying chronic medical conditions, symptoms from onset to admission, vital signs, laboratory finding, complications, and outcomes. the date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptom was noticed. for all patients, the glasgow coma score (gcs), sofa score, curb65 score, and apache ii score were assessed within 24 hours of admission. the length of hospitalization and outcome state of each patient were recorded.ards was defined according to the berlin definition (12) . acute kidney injury was identified according to the kidney disease: improving global outcomes definition. the cardiac injury was defined if the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin i) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography (11) .based on the clinical implications of laboratory indices, we identified the cut-off value of these indicators to be the upper or lower limits of their normal range. values are presented as mean ± sd or as number and percentage for continuous variables and categorical variables, respectively. the difference of categorical variables between the survivors and deaths groups was compared by chi-square test or fisher exact test when appropriate, whereas continuous variables were compared using student t test. spearman correlation analysis was performed among significant variables in the univariate analysis. univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis was used to explore the effect of apache ii score, sofa score, and curb65 score on the occurrence of death. taking account of the potential bias, only variables with the absolute value of a correlation coefficient less than 0.4 were included in the initial model of multivariate cox regression analysis. receiver operating characteristics (roc) analyses were conducted to evaluate and compare the predictive value of these three scoring systems. the scoring system with largest area under the curve (auc) of roc curve was selected for further analysis. the cut-off value of the selected scoring system was determined based on the maximum youden index. then the patients with covid-19 were classified into two groups: low risk, less than cut-off point value and high risk, greater than or equal to cut-off point value. kaplan-meier method was used to compare the survival between these two groups with log-rank test. a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. all analyses were performed with sas 9.4 (sas institute, cary, nc) and r project version 3.6.2 (r project for statistical computing, vienna, austria; http://cran.r-project.org).from january 10, 2020, to february 10, 2020, 178 inpatients with symptoms of covid-19 had been admitted to icu of tongji hospital. of these patients, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. therefore, only 154 patients, including 102 survivors and 52 deaths, were enrolled in this study. most of these patients (92.86%) were admitted to icu directly, and 11 patients were transferred from other wards. the days stay in the ward before icu admission were 5.27 ± 2.87. except for pneumothorax, the occurrence rate of other complications was much higher in the deaths (all p < 0.001). the duration of hospitalization in deaths and survivors was similar, with 12.38 ± 6.99 days and 12.86 ± 6.08 days, respectively (p = 0.487) ( table 1) .laboratory abnormalities at admission were more frequently observed in deaths than in survivors. elevated level of wbc, monocyte, d-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hypersensitive troponin i, and procalcitonin were observed in deaths, when compared with survivors (all p < 0.05). total bilirubin of greater than 26 μmol/l was documented in seven deaths (13.46%) and three survivors (2.94%). the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (18.67 ± 16.93 vs 7.08 ± 6.86; p < 0.001) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (315.96 ± 235.45 vs 284.00 ± 245.38; p < 0.001) were higher in deaths than in survivors. the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were longer, whereas the levels of platelet and albumin were lower in deaths (all p < 0.05) ( table 2) .a total of 148 patients (96.10%) presented bilateral pneumonia, and the other six patients (3.90%) showed unilateral pneumonia (table 1) . appendix figure 1 in multivariable cox regression analyses, high apache ii score (adjusted hazard ratio [hr], 1.07; 95% ci, 1.10-1.13) and sofa score (adjusted hr, 1.43; 95% ci, 1.26-1.62) increased the hospital mortality risk for the patients with covid-19 ( table 3) . roc analyses were used to determine the cut-off value of these three scoring systems in evaluating hospital mortality risk. the auc was 0.966 (95% ci, 0.942-0.990), 0.867 (95% ci, 0.808-0.926), and 0.844 (95% ci, 0.784-0.905) for apache ii, sofa, and curb65 scores, with the cut-off point value of 17, 3, and 1, respectively. comparing to the other two scoring systems, apache ii score was a better predictor for hospital mortality of covid-19, with sensitivity and specificity to be 96.15% and 86.27%, respectively (p < 0.001) (fig. 1) .patients were then divided into two groups based on the cutoff point value of apache ii score: low risk, less than 17 and high risk, greater than or equal to 17. the median follow-up time since admission was 12 days (range, 2-17 d). kaplan-meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with covid-19 with low risk was significantly higher than that of patients with high risk (p < 0.001). the median survival time for the patients in high-risk group was 14 days (95% ci, 10-16 d) (fig. 2) .this is a retrospective study on the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the patients with covid-19. about half of the patients had organ dysfunctions. apache ii score was demonstrated to be independently associated with hospital mortality in patients with covid-19. furthermore, apache ii score performed better to predict hospital mortality in patients with covid-19 compared with sofa and curb65 scores. apache ii score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death, which may help provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.sars-cov-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans like sars-cov and middle eastern respiratory syndrome (mers)-cov, and these viruses are all related to high mortality in patients with critical illness. in a cohort of 38 critical patients with sars in canada, 43% of patients had died at 28 days (13) . fifty-eight percentage of patients had died at 90 days in a saudi arabia cohort with 12 patients with mers (14) . yang et al (6) reported 61.5% of critically ill patients with covid-19 had died at 28 days. in our cohort, two thirds of critically ill patients died. the mortality of patients with covid-2019 was higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with sars and mers. several of the reasons are as follows. first, a large number of covid-19 cases occurred in a short period of time led to difficulty in hospitalization treatment. in our cohort, the duration from onset to hospitalization was longer in deaths medicine remains inadequate. because of the considerable mortality of patients with covid-19, a clinically predictive system for early warning of mortality risk is urgently needed. the cut-off value of apache ii score in covid-19 is much lower to predict mortality. several reasons may explain it. first, gcs is an important component of apache ii score. direct damage to the nervous system by sars-cov-2 was rarely reported. only a few patients had a disturbance of consciousness in the study. most of them suffered from hypoxemia-induced ischemic hypoxic encephalopathy and one was attributed to underlying cerebral hemorrhage. second, apache ii score was assessed according to the characteristics of the patients on the first day of icu admission. abnormal levels of serum sodium and potassium were observed in some patients, but only a few patients got scores for the corresponding part in apache ii score. finally, according to our observation, several patients deteriorated during their stay in the hospital in a few days and quickly died. although timely given powerful empirical treatments including glucocorticoid, immunoglobulin, mechanical ventilation, etc, the patients were still hard to recover from covid-19. a recent study showed the median apache ii score of survivors and deaths in critically ill patients with covid-19 were 14 and 18, respectively (6) . this indicated that covid-19 might be more variable and mortal, compared with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. further studies are needed to confirm our findings.apache ii score, sofa score, and curb65 score are commonly used to describe multiple organ function for assessing disease severity and estimate hospital mortality (7, 9, 15) . according to recent reports, any underlying disorder was significantly more common in severe cases when compared with nonsevere cases. the medical history of coronary heart disease was an independent determinant of critical illness of the patients with covid-19 (16) , and it was also associated with a higher risk of mortality in patients with covid-19 (17) . in this cohort, about half of patients had one or more underlying comorbidities, and coronary heart disease was more common in deaths than in survivors. it suggested that comorbidities played an important role in the death of the patients with covid-19. age has also been identified to be associated with the severity and death in patients with covid-19 based on the present and previous studies (18) (19) (20) . of the three score systems, only apache ii score includes comorbidities and age, whereas curb65 score takes into account only age, and sofa score takes into account neither of them. these may explain why apache ii score performed better than the other two for predicting mortality in patients with covid-19.notably, sars-cov-2 mainly caused lung lesions, but other organs injury cannot be neglected. in the present study, we found that the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was higher in deaths than that in survivors. qu et al (21) also demonstrated that high platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio was associated with severe illness in patients with covid-19. platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio mainly reflects the level of systemic inflammation, and high value may lead to adverse outcome. recent studies have shown that the proportion of developing liver injury in patients with severe covid-19 was significantly higher than that in mild patients (22) (23) (24) . our study also found that the proportion of liver dysfunction was higher in the deaths group than that in the survivors group, consistent with the other study (25) . currently, studies on the mechanisms of sars-cov-2-related liver injury are limited. it has been shown that sars-cov-2 also uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as its entry receptor as sars-cov does (26) . whether it results in liver damage in patients remains to be investigated. troponin i was significantly increased in patients with severe covid-19 compared with those with milder illness (16) . the mechanisms may be similar to that of myocardial injury in other severe respiratory illnesses in which myocardial oxygen demand is heightened and inflammation is rampant (27) . further studies are need to confirm the mechanisms underlying these findings.there were still some limitations in our study. first, the present study was a retrospective, single-center study with a relatively small sample size. second, all patients were enrolled from the icu in tongji hospital. most patients were transferred from other hospitals or isolation units. these patients were more likely to progress to adverse outcomes. therefore, the mortality of patients with covid-19 in this study may be much higher than general population (28) and may be not generalized. third, the treatments may influence the outcomes of patients with covid-19. but in this study, we aimed to apply the characteristics of the patients at the first day admitted to icu to predict the outcome of the patients with covid-19. additional research is needed to understand the role of apache ii score in the risk stratification of patients with covid-19.apache ii score was identified to be an effectively clinical tool to predict mortality in patients with covid-19 compared with sofa score and curb65 score. future researches are needed to explore whether the application of apache ii score in patients with covid-19 could reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes.in december 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) broke out in wuhan, china, which caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) [1, 2] . the covid-19 had been affirmed to have human-to-human transmissibility [3] and has now spread worldwide, which raised high attention not only within china but internationally. the world health organization (who) reported that there are 118, 326 confirmed cases and 4292 deaths in globally until march 11, 2020 [4] , and evaluated as global pandemic on the same day [5] .in retrospect studies, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in guangdong in 2003 gradually faded with the warming weather coming, and was basically ended until july [6] . it has been documented that the temperature and its variations might have affected the sars outbreak [7] . a study in korea found that the risk of influenza incidence was significantly increased with low daily temperature and low/high relative humidity, a positive significant association was observed for diurnal temperature range (dtr) [8] . moreover, temperature [9] and dtr [10] have been linked to the death from respiratory diseases. a study demonstrated that absolute humidity had significant correlations with influenza viral survival and transmission rates [11] . couple of studies reported that the covid-19 was related to the meteorological factors, which decreased with the temperature increasing [12, 13] , but their effects on the mortality had not been reported. therefore, we assume that the weather conditions might also contributed to the mortality of covid-19.as the capital of hubei province and one of the largest city in central china, wuhan is located in the middle of the yangtze river delta, which has a typical subtropical, humid, monsoon climate with cold winters and warm summers [14] . the average annual temperature and rainfall are 15.8 °c-17.5 °c and 1050 mm-2000 mm, respectively [15] . besides, wuhan owns an area of 8494 km 2 and a population over 11 million (as of 2018) [16] . so far, this covid-19 has caused 5393 deaths globally, . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under

15.20036426 doi: medrxiv preprint and caused 2456 deaths in wuhan. although the deaths may be affected by many factors, the present is to explore the effect from meteorological angel with generalized additive model (gam).data from 20 january to 29 absolute humidity was calculated according to the previous study and was measured by vapor pressure (vp) [17] . the density of water vapor, or absolute humidity [ρ v (g/m 3 )], is the mass of moisture per total volume of air. it is associated to vp via the ideal gas law for the moist portion of the air:where e is vapor pressure (vp), r v is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 j/(kg k)], and t is the daily ambient temperature (k). vp is a commonly used indicator of absolute humidity and is calculated from ambient temperature and relative humidity using the clausius-clapeyron relation [18] . briefly, we first calculated the saturation vapor pressure [e s (t) (mb)] from daily ambient temperature using the following equation:where e s (t 0 ) denotes saturation vapor pressure at a reference temperature t 0 (273.15 k) which equals to 6.11 mb. l denotes the latent heat of evaporation for water (2257 kj/kg). r v is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 j/(kg k)]. t denotes daily ambient temperature (k). then, vp (pa) was calculated by combining the e s (t) calculated using eq. (2) with relative humidity (rh):a descriptive analysis was performed. we used a generalized additive model (gam) to analyze the associations between meteorological factors (temperature, dtr, relative humidity and absolute humidity) and the daily mortality of covid-19. the core analysis was a gam with a quasi-poisson link function based on the previous studies [19, 20] . we first built the basic models for mortality . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 15.20036426 doi: medrxiv preprint outcomes without including air pollution or weather variables. we incorporated smoothed spline functions of time, which accommodate nonlinear and nonmonotonic patterns between mortality and time, thus offering a flexible modeling tool. then, we introduced the weather variables and analyzed their effects on mortality. akaike's information criterion was used as a measure of how well the model fitted the data. consistent with several recent time-series studies [21, 22] , the penalized smoothing spline function was applied to control the effects of confounding factors, such as time trends, day-of-week and air pollution. the core gam equation is:where t is the day of the observation; e(y t ) is the expected number of daily mortality for covid-19 on day t; α is the intercept;β is the regression coefficient; x t is the daily level of weather variables on day t; s() denotes the smoother based on the penalized smoothing spline. based on quasi akaike information criterion (qaic), the 2 degrees of freedom (df) was used for time trends and 3 df for air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity; dow is a categorical variable indicating the date of the week.after establishing the core model, we also considered the lag effects of weather conditions on death of covid-19, and examined the potentially lagged effects, i.e., single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 5) and multiple-day average lag (from lag 01 to lag 05) [23] . the exposure and response correlation curves between weather variables and covid-19 mortality were plotted using a spline function in the gam. we also performed a sensitivity analysis by changing the df of the penalized smoothing spline function from 2 to 9 for calendar time and from 3 to 8 for temperature and humidity.all of the statistical analyses were two-sided, and at a 5% level of significance. all analyses were conducted using r software (version 3.5.3) with the gam fitted by the "mgcv" package (version 1.8-27). the effect estimates were expressed as the percentage changes and their 95% confidence intervals (cis) in daily mortality of covid-19 associated with per 1 unit increase in weather variables. the correlation results between mortality counts of covid-19, meteorological measures and air pollutant concentrations were presented in table 2 . the mortality counts of covid-19 was negatively associated with relative humidity (r = −0.32), pm 2.5 (r = −0.53) and pm 10 (r = −0.45). a positive . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.is the (which was not peer-reviewed) the copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03. 15.20036426 doi: medrxiv preprint association with covid-19 mortality was observed for dtr (r = 0.44), and so 2 (r = 0.31). and covid-19 mortality at current day. generally, the curves tended to be not associated with covid-19 mortality for dtr but were strongly positive for temperature. in addition, the curves associated with relative humidity and absolute humidity presented similar linear trends, which indicated that the higher level of humidity might cause decrease in the covid-19 mortality. the study was conducted in wuhan during 20 january, 2020 to 29 february, 2020, in order to investigate the association between weather variables and daily death number of covid-19.significant positive effect of dtr on the daily mortality counts of covid-19 was first identified through our study. it is also found that a significant negative association with covid-19 mortality is observed for temperature and absolute humidity. the results indicate that the effects of dtr should also be paid attention on the mortality of covid-19.our study demonstrated a negative association between covid-19 case fatality and temperature, while a positive association for dtr. the results are consistent with the following investigations.respiratory diseases mortality increased with decreasing temperature [24], and was strongly associated with low temperature [25-27]. while another study found that both cold and heat effects may have adverse impact on respiratory mortality [28] . otherwise, the study conducted in 30 east asian cities showed that increased dtr was associated with increased risk of mortality for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [29] . in the cold season, the cumulative relative risk of non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular death increased at high dtr values in tabriz [30] . a time-series study done in shanghai on the effect of dtr and daily chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) mortality showing that each 1°c elevation in the 4-day moving average for dtr accounted for 1.25% of increased risk of copd mortality [31] . a review for cold exposure and immune function reported that lower temperature may repress the immune function [32] , particularly, our previous finding suggested that the phagocytic function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages declined under cold stress in vitro experiment [33] . breathing cold air can lead to bronchial constriction, which may promote susceptibility to pulmonary infection [34] . additionally, since sars-cov-2 is sensitive to heat, and high temperature makes it difficult to survive, not to mention the beneficial factors for virus transmission like indoor crowding and poor ventilation in cold days [35] . also, cold temperature has been discovered to be associated with the reduction of lung function and increases in exacerbations for people with copd [36] . in addition, dtr represents a stable measure of

source of environmental stress [30] . our findings highlight a need to strengthen the awareness of the effects of temperature and dtr on covid-19 mortality.researchers confirmed that respiratory infection was enhanced during unusually cold and low humidity conditions [38] , indicating low humidity may be also an important risk factor for respiratory diseases. worse, a study with data of more than 25 years found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality and low-humidity levels may cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms [39] , similar to a study carried out in the united states [40] . consistent to these finding, our results also indicated that the risk of dying from covid-19 decreased only with absolute humidity increasing. breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; the formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread [41] . moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is the most efficient under cold, dry conditions [42] , and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity [43] , which may be similar to coronavirus. therefore, the increase of covid-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter.however, many limitations should not be ignored. firstly, there are some other factors may affect the covid-19 mortality, such as population migration, government intervention and so on. secondly, ecologic time-series study design was adopted in the study, which might exist ecologic fallacy.furthermore, it is difficult to obtain the meteorological and air pollution data at the individual level.nevertheless, this study showed that dtr might be associated with the death risk of covid-19 in wuhan, which deserves further investigation.this is the first study to investigate the effects of temperature, dtr and humidity on daily mortality of covid-19 in chinese population by utilizing publicly accessible data on covid-19 statistics and weather variables. our finding shows that daily mortality of covid-19 is positively association with dtr but negatively with relative humidity. in summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the covid-19 mortality. gam: generalized additive model;

the new coronavirus disease 2019 in mexico was confirmed on february 28 th , 2020 1 . since then, the government of mexico has launched a series of preventive measures which adhere to the world health organization (who) sars-cov-2 strategic preparedness and response plan aimed at limiting the spread of the virus 2 . the "national campaign for healthy distance", implemented from march 23 rd to may 30 th 2020 included social distance, hand washing, general confinement, self-isolation for those with covid-19 associated symptoms for 14 days and limited economic mobility 3 globally, individual factors associated with covid-19 mortality have been found to be: male sex, age over 65 years, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease, among others 5, 6 . according to the 2018 national health and nutrition survey (ensanut-2018) of mexico, 36.1% of adults over the age of 19 were obese, 39.1% overweight, 13.7% diabetic and 25% hypertensive 7 . considering that most states in mexico hold a heterogeneous distribution in the prevalence of such comorbidities, regions with an increased burden of these diseases and sociodemographic related factors are at higher risk of encountering more severe manifestations of covid-19 which might require hospitalization or critical care, as well as higher covid-19 mortality rates.it is deemed that in order to curb the pandemic, national decisions ought to be in coordination with those at a local level. in the united states sociodemographic and health factors related to covid-19 vary importantly across counties [8] [9] [10] .mexico has 2,457 municipalities distributed in 32 states, which are the basis of the territorial organization and the political and administrative division 11 . by june 1 st , 2020, the federal government gave the states of the country the responsibility for deciding the reopening of social, educational and economic activities based on a "traffic light" system established by the moh 12 . covid-19 is however expected to linger within communities for several months or even years to come. targeted public policy interventions in regions that are highly vulnerable to covid-19 are crucial to safeguard, protect and strengthen communities facing the pandemic. therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the municipality-level factors associated with a higher mortality rate (mr) of covid-19 in mexico, and to pinpoint locations expected to suffer from a high covid-19 mortality.coronavirus pandemic surveillance in mexico has been carried out using the sentinel model proposed by the pan american health organization (paho) 13 .this model works with 475 nationally representative health facilities that monitor coronavirus cases through the test for sars-cov-2 conducted in ten percent of suspected cases and 100% those suspected with severe acute respiratory syndrome and signs of breathing difficulty, or in deaths of those hospitalized suspected to be covid-19 cases. the operational definition of a suspected case in mexico is of an individual who in the last 7 days presented at least 2 of the following signs and symptoms: cough, fever, or headache, accompanied by at least one of the following signs or symptoms: dyspnea, arthralgia, myalgia, odynophagia/pharyngeal burning, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis and/or chest pain 14 .a confirmed case of covid-19 is defined as a person with a diagnosis given by the national network of public health laboratories recognized by the institute of epidemiological diagnosis and reference (indre) who met the criteria of a suspected case 15 .we used the daily updated open data source from the general directorate of epidemiology of mexican moh which includes demographic and health information of confirmed, negative, and suspect cases of covid-19. 4 we extracted the data as of june 20 th , 2020 of the number of confirmed symptomatic cases and deaths. at the municipality-level level, we obtained data on variables that we hypothesized could be linked to differential testing practices or exposure to sars-cov-2 of the most recent and complete information from census, and records from to identify the municipality-level factors associated with the mortality rate of covid-19, we adjusted a negative binomial regression model in which the dependent variable was the sum of confirmed covid-19 deaths in symptomatic cases (n=18 886) by municipality of residence and the independent variables were the quintiles of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes within the municipality. expected mortality rates (emr) for each municipality, incidence rate ratios (irr) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated.to better understand the association between mr of covid-19 and municipalitylevel factors, and in addition to the main objective of the study, we also fitted . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder,

(supplementary table 2 .) in concordance with the municipality-level results, diabetes, belonging to an indigenous ethnic group, and obesity were associated with higher risk of mortality due to coronavirus. other individual risk factors of lethality-case were age 40 or over, male sex, hypertension, ckd, copd and immunosuppression. in addition, having received medical care in private health institutions was associated with a lower lethality of covid-19 compared to those cared for at public health services. as for individuals who sought medical attention between 6 and 14 days after the onset of symptoms, they had a higher risk of dying compared to those who received medical care between 0 and 5 days after the onset of symptoms.in supplementary table 3 , we illustrate the municipality-level factors associated to the cumulative incidence and lethality rates as of june 20 th , 2020 and disaggregated by month. we found that municipality-level factors association with cumulative incidence and mortality rate of covid-19 varied within the course of the pandemic in mexico.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted july 14, 2020. . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted july 14, 2020. . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted july 14, 2020. . . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted july 14, 2020. .municipality-level factors found to be associated with higher risk of mortality of covid-19were the population density, the prevalence of diabetes and obesity, the mortality rate of diabetes, the proportion of indigenous population, of economically active population and the rate of economic units that operate essential activities during the covid-19 outbreak.first, high proportion of population economically active may reflect lower confinement and increased mobility, while higher population density is may be related to less social distancing and high connectivity. secondly, high mortality rate of diabetes means inadequate control of glucose levels -which has a negative impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems both crucial in the body's response to covid-19 25 -and also, lower access and quality of medical care, or weaker local health care systems 26 .despite of at the individual level, the hypertension was associated with higher lethality of covid-19. at the municipality level, the mortality rate of hypertension was not associated with high mortality of covid-19, and within states with the highest prevalence of hypertension they had lower mortality risk of covid-19. this result could be explained by the fact that the prevalence used in our model came from adults already diagnosed with hypertension, which according to previous surveys represented approximately 60% of the total cases of hypertensive population and are those with access to health care services and antihypertensive medication 27 . nevertheless, unknown and unobserved variables, prior to the demand of healthcare services might be reflecting an inverse association between hypertension and covid-19 mortality.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted july 14, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151522 doi: medrxiv preprintit is important to note that the cumulative incidence of cases in indigenous populations was low; however, the risk of mortality from coronavirus was higher than in municipalities with lower proportion of indigenous population. these findings could indicate a lower access to healthcare services and testing, combined with a dynamic where the epidemic migrates further into more marginalized areas with a higher proportion of indigenous population.other countries have found that many mechanisms underlying the higher lethality of covid-19 in ethnic minorities are related to marginalization conditions such as locality of residence, work conditions and health inequalities 28, 29 .marginalized conditions such as non-sewage service or dirt floors were inversely associated with mortality of covid-19. communities with these household characteristics are mostly remote and with low connectivity, which could be protective from sars-cov-2 exposure.notwithstanding, marginalized and remote communities could also have lower access to both testing for sars-cov-2 and health care which could lead to underreporting of cases and deaths. special screening strategies and tracing and isolation of contacts within these vulnerable communities are essential to favor the prevention of deaths from covid-19 30 .in may 2020, the mexican moh published a list of 324 municipios de la esperanza ("hope municipalities") which in the last 28 days prior to may 16 did not have any confirmed cases of covid-19 and were not adjacent to municipalities with confirmed cases. this list was a guide for state governors to restart non-essential activities on may 18, 2020 31 . however, according to our results, 16% of these municipality-level are at high risk of having worse outcomes in the event of an outbreak and, as of june 20, 2020, 389 symptomatic cases and 29 deaths due to covid-19 were confirmed in these municipalities.the identification of municipalities with a high burden of risk factors of severe illness or death of covid-19 is critical to establish the most convenient health policies at the . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted july 14, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.11.20151522 doi: medrxiv preprint municipality level. many of these municipalities are in locations susceptible to an outbreak onset as the pandemic evolves in mexico. municipalities with no confirmed cases yet, but with populations at risk of becoming seriously ill from covid-19 could have a greater burden of the disease in the upcoming months if contingency measures and mobility restrictions are eased to soon. a targeted approach will be crucial to prevent or control the onset of new outbreaks within these municipalities include testing, isolation and contact tracing as well as more general measures according to the three-stage traffic light system that was established in mexico to reactivate the economy and reduce contingency measures 12 .additional to the municipality-level factors associated with the cumulative incidence and mortality of covid-19 we identified that municipalities in condition of extreme poverty had higher case-fatality rate of covid-19. for example, oaxaca, chihuahua and guerrero are states in which some municipalities had case-fatality rates higher than 80%. this finding suggests a low availability of tests in this communities.as per the limitations within our study, que precision of the estimations depends on the quality of the databases for example; the aging of our data for some variables is up to 10 years, which may not reflect heterogeneous changes within municipalities by 2020.nevertheless, data from previous years, still holds relation to the following years and they were useful to find expected associations. for obesity, diabetes and hypertension prevalence, the information from the ensanut-2018 are representatively at state level reducing the variability within municipalities. however, for the rest of the variables, such as mortality rates of diabetes and hypertension, information was disaggregated at the municipality.finally, the ecological design of our study prevented us to from establishing causal associations.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

[10, 11] the sars-cov-2 infectious pneumonia has similar clinical features including fever, cough, and shortness of breath [12, 13] to sars-cov infectious pneumonia.however, current trends suggest that the sars-cov-2 is more transmissible and spreads faster than the sars-cov and the mers-cov.in this study, we analyzed and compared the epidemic features of the covid-19 in hubei province and other regions in china. we further explored the differences between regions to better understand the epidemic of the covid-19 and provide different control strategies toward hubei province and other regions in china.a comprehensive search of the chinese center for disease control and prevention official websites and announcements [14] was performed between 20 jan 2020 and 29 feb 2020. the relevant data of the distribution of infection on each reported day were obtained. [15] (fig.1) the differences suggested that the sars-cov-2 is more infectious and transmittable compared with the sars-cov.since the chinese national health commission announcements of confirmed and suspected cases on 20 jan 2020, the number of confirmed cases has continued to increase, especially in hubei province. by 29 feb 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in china had reached 79,824, including 66,907 in hubei province, with wuhan having 41,625 confirmed cases( fig.2 and 3) . however, the growth rate began to decrease on 27 jan 2020 and has continued to decline over the past days after rebounding on 14 feb 2020, and fell earlier in other regions than in hubei province. at present, the growth rate of confirmed cases is 0.01% nationwide while the growth rate is significantly higher in hubei province than in other regions(0.09% versus 0.00%)(( fig.2 and 4 ).the number of suspected patients is also declining. by 29 feb 2020, the total number of suspected cases was 851 in china including 646 in hubei province (fig.5 ). the number of suspected patients and the growth rate of increased suspected patients were significantly higher in hubei province than that in other regions( fig.5and 6 ).the number of suspected patients began to decline in hubei province from 9 feb 2020 and in other regions from 14 feb 2020 after slowly increasing (fig.5 ).of the 79,824, confirmed cases, 2,870 deaths were reported nationwide j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 8 by 29 feb 2020, with a mortality of 3.6%, while the mortality was 4.1%(2,761/66,907) and 0.84%(109/12,917) in hubei province and other regions nationwide, respectively (fig.7) . the mortality of the covid-19 was significantly increased in hubei province compared with other regions nationwide.more patients admitted to hospitals for treatment were discharged than died since 1 feb 2020, and the trend has significantly increased (fig.8) .by 29 feb 2020, the number of discharged patients was 41,625, which has exceeded the number of hospitalized patients. this change suggested initial control of the outbreak and further enhanced confidence in fighting the disease.since the first official announcement on 31 dec 2019 by the wuhan municipal health commission. [1] the infection quickly spread in china, and internationally. who defined it as a public health emergency of international concern (pheic)on 31 january 2020.the pathogen was soon isolated from apatient's alveolar lavage and identified as a novel coronavirus. [16] the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) virus, the middle eastern respiratory syndrome (mers) virus, and the sars-cov-2 all belong to beta-covs. bat coronavirus (bcov) and the sars-cov-2 share 96.2% sequence identity, confirming that sars-cov-2 has a zoonotic origin. [17, 18] r 0 is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person in a totally naïve population. r 0 estimates for sars were reported to range between 2-5. different mathematical methods used to estimate r 0 for sars-cov-2 produced a range from 1.5 to 6.49 based on different epidemic stages. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] the most prominent area of hubei province is wuhan with 49,122 cases, which suggested that mass outbreak of covid-19 and community spread in wuhan. a previous report indicated that among nonresidents of wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city, [24] which suggested that it was mostly associated to feb 2020 because test reagents for rt-pcr assay began to be widely used in hubei province along with lung ct as the diagnostic criteria. this did not represent a large number of patients in a mass outbreak on 14 feb 2020, and the decrease in the rate of confirmed patients before the 14 feb 2020 was an illusion due to a lack of enough test reagents. also, suspected cases began to significantly decrease from 14 feb 2020 because suspected cases were confirmed or ruled out by test reagents widely used and the new diagnostic criteria of lung ct.according to a recent report by the chinese center for disease control and prevention, the overall mortality was 2.3% and non-co-morbidity mortality was 0.9% in patients with covid-19, [25] which is lower than sars and mers. the mortality of the covid-19 was significantly higher in hubei province than other regions nationwide(4.1% versus 0.84%). this may be because of the following factors: 1) the virulence and pathogenicity of the virus decreased in the 2nd and 3rd generation of transmission [26] , 2)a significant number of mild and asymptomatic patients did not seek medical attention, 3)early patients cannot be confirmed due to lacking the nucleic acid test, and 4)some severe patients with co-morbidity lost the opportunity for timely treatment due to insufficient medical resources in the early days of the epidemic. so, the high mortality in hubei province may be overestimated and mortality of other regions should better reflect the pathogenicity of the covid-19.the good news is that since 1feb 2020 the number of recovered cases has exceeded the number of deaths, and the number of discharged patients has exceeded the number of hospitalized patients and this trend has further increased over the past days, which suggests initial control of the outbreak and has enhanced confidence in fighting the disease.initially, the lack of disease awareness and inappropriate prevention and control led to a rapid epidemic of infections in hubei province, and the emergence of 2nd and 3rd-generation infections and community spread. thanks to dr. edward c. mignot, shandong university, for linguistic advice.dwj and hsl had full access to all data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis. lq had the idea of and designed the study. zzf contributed to reviewed and approved the final version.the authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.approval was not required. the number of discharged cases exceeds the number of the dead.poor dietary habits are considered to be the second-leading risk factors for mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) in the world. the poor dietary habits are responsible for 10.3 million deaths and 229.1 million dalys in 2016 (1) . for example, the following dietary habits are among the leading risk factors for early death and disability in european countries. the habits are low intakes of whole grains, fruit and vegetables, and nuts and seeds, and high intakes of alcohol and sodium. the western dietary habits are consuming diet processed, high in red and processed meat, diets with high in sugar-sweetened beverages, and low in milk. these kinds of dietary habits are regarded to be a rising health concern.dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, and economic factors. however, the dietary patterns are becoming similar due to increasing living standards and growing globalization of the food sector (2, 3) .mertens et al. (4) explored the dietary intakes in four different european counters using individual-level dietary intake in adults in nationally-representative surveys of denmark, france, czech republic, and italy. they reported a higher intake of fruits and vegetables and lower intakes of sweetened beverages and alcohol in italy. while individuals in denmark and the czech republic had a higher intake of vegetables. a comparison of population subgroups within countries shows that there is a difference in the dietary preferences, beliefs, and practices for particular consumer groups. for example, highly-educated persons and women have a higher intake of fish, nuts, and seeds along with lower intake of red and processed meats (5) .the individual-level reported dietary data of the countries could be used as a useful tool to make a connection between health and environment with foods as their common denominator (1) . a recent review study reported that the detailed assessment of patients for the dietary and nutritional risks along with medical, lifestyle, and environmental factors with suitable risk management strategies make the sensible way to deal with the covid-19 (6) . the diet and nutrition have a variance impact on the immune system competence. in addition, they determine the risk and severity of the infections. the relation between diet, nutrition, infection, and immunity is bidirectional (7) . the macro-, micronutrients, and phytonutrients in diet, such as fruits and colorful vegetables improve healthy immune responses. the microand phytonutrients provide the antioxidants and the antiinflammatory nutrients, like beta-carotene, vitamin c, vitamin e, and polyphenolic compounds resulting in modulating the immune functions (8, 9) .nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. the sufficient intake of iron, zinc, and vitamins a, e, b6, and b12 is vital for the overall maintenance of immune function (10) .the new epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has become a pandemic to the world currently. we make a hypothesis that geographical variation in dietary factors could have a role in infection and mortality rates of covid-19 in the world. therefore, we aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of covis-19 in this study.in the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary data from the global dietary databases of the united nations (11) and coronavirus disease statistics from the world health organization (who) were included (12) . the countries that had coronavirus disease statistics from the who were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors.the countries/states met eligibility criteria for this investigation if they had the statistics from the who coronavirus disease (covid-19) situation dashboard from the website of the world health organization by 24 april 2020 (12) . the following countries were excluded from the analysis due to not having the statistics of the covid-19; comoros, north korea, kiribati, lesotho, malawi, marshall islands, micronesia, nauru, palau, samoa, sao tome, and principe, solomon islands, south sudan, tajikistan, tonga, turkmenistan, tuvalu, vanuatu, and yemen.the following countries were excluded from the study due to not having data on the national dietary factors on the website of the global dietary database (11) the populations of the countries were extracted from the united nations statistics division (13) . the estimated populations of the year 2018 were considered for the countries. some of the countries had not the population for the year 2018. therefore, the authors checked for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. accordingly, the population of 2017 was used for the following country; algeria.the population of 2015 was considered for the following countries: lybia; sierra leone. the population of 2016 was extracted for the following countries: mali; mauritania; papua new guinea; sudan and 2017 for the following countries; bhutan; bosni; burkina faso; fiji; guyana; niger; nigeria; pakistan; uae.the populations of the following countries were not available for the 2015-2019 period. therefore, the population of the following countries was not included in this study based on the eligibility criteria. these countries were the central african republic; djibouti; djibouti; dominica; gabon; kosovo; lebanon; liberia; moldova; russia; saint kitts and nevis; syria; somalia, the democratic republic of the cong. finally, 158 countries/states were included in this study.the general characteristics of the countries were presented in median (interquartile range [iqr], mean (std. deviation), and number (percentage). the confirmed and dead cases were presented in median and interquartile range due to the nonnormal distribution of the data. the normality of the outcomes was examined in drawing a histogram and box plot. the number of confirmed cases was divided by the total population of a country multiplied by 1000,000 to obtain the infection rate of covid-19 per one million persons. the number of dead cases was divided by the total number of confirmed cases and divided by total population multiplied by 1000,000 to obtain the mortality rate/1000,000 persons.. the infection and mortality rates were determined in a median and interquartile range following dealing with the potential outliers. the upper limit values were considered for the extremely higher limit values in the infection and mortality rates. the crude infection rate was categorized into the following groups; 0-500; 500-1000; 1000-1500; 1500-2000; 2000-2500; and > 2500 per one million person.the infection and mortality rates were transformed through the ln technique to obtain a normally distributed histogram. no ethical aspect was applicable to this study.the median crude infection rate by covid-19 was 87.78 (iqr: 468.03) ranged between 0.00 and 24034.51 per 1000,000 persons. the median mortality rate by covid-19 was 0.0015 (iqr: 0.0059) ranged between 0.00 and 1.3728 per 1000,000 persons. the two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500-1000 (8.9%) per one million persons ( table 1) .the study showed the crude infection rate was raised with increasing consuming fruits (r=0.416; p<0.001), unprocessed red meats (r=0.457; p<0.001), fruit juices (r=0.390; p<0.001), total protein (r=0.275; p<0.001), calcium (r=0.550; p<0.001), potassium (r=0.371, p<0.001), and total milk (r=0.450; p<0.001). regarding crude mortality rate per 1000,000 persons; the study showed that crude mortality rate was raised with increasing consuming unprocessed red meats (r=0.234; p=0.007), sugar sweetened beverages (r=0.224; p=0.010), fruit juices (r=0.272; p=0.002), calcium (r=0.288; p=0.001), and total milk (r=0.230; p=0.008). however, the mortality rate was decreased following increasing consuming non-starchy vegetables (r=-0.196; p=0.023), see table 2 .the regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (beta: 0.237; p=0.006) and calcium (beta: 0.286; p=0.007). however, the infection rate was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes (beta: -0.145; p=0.038), table 3 .the effect of dietary factors on the crude mortality rate by covid-19 was examined in the regression analysis. the analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (beta: 0.340; p<0.001). whereas, the crude mortality rate by covid-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming (beta: -0.226; p=0.047) and beans and legumes (beta: -0.176; p=0.046), as presented in table 4 .the comparison of dietary factors in countries with different infection rates was examined in table 5 and fig 2. the study showed that the countries with higher infection rates between 1500 and above had a higher intake of fruits (p=0.002), fruit juices (p<0.001), calcium (p<0.001), potassium (p<0.001), and total milk (p<0.001). however, these countries had a lower intake of unprocessed red meats (p<0.001) and total protein (p=0.013).the aim of the food-based dietary guidelines is to maintain the general health of the population and prevent non-communicable diseases (14) . most of the food-based dietary guidelines recommend intake of whole grains, fruit and vegetables, low-fat dairy and fish, and low intake of red and processed meat, sugar-sweetened food products, alcohol, and salt (15) .the present study showed that the crude infection rate by covid-19 has been increased by raising consuming fruits, calcium and decreased with increasing consuming beans and legumes. regarding the mortality rate, the analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages and decreased by increasing fruits consuming and beans and legumes.the anti-inflammatory strategies inside foods, nutrients, or (16, 17) since the coronavirus has serious inflammatory consequences for acute pneumonia in persons (18) . the human coronavirus infections cause mild to severe diseases, systemic inflammation, high fever, cough, and acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction in internal organs leading to death. this virus is classified as a ribonucleic acid (rna) virus. the virus has a genome that often escapes the innate immune system, particularly if it is malfunctioning (19) . entering coronavirus into the organism activates innate immunity, which intervenes in the first instance to engulf the invader. the severity of the diseases locates within the ability of innate immune cells to stem viral infection (20) . the virus has less ability to replicate itself and induce the pathological state in the case of the stronger innate immune system. when the immune system is suppressed by the virus, the body activates the adaptive immunity. the coronavirus enables to produce viral enzymes and proteases. these enzymes and proteases can damage the immunity and inhibit the signaling pathways of type i interferon (ifn) along with the nuclear factor-κb, facilitating innate immune evasion (21) .apart from the age-related micronutrient inadequacy, the nutritional status of a person has a role in the developing risk of sars-cov-ii infection, the clinical course, and the disease outcomes. hence, the maintenance of host macro-and micronutrient status is considered to be a crucial preventive measure for covid-19 (6) .the coronavirus infection is primarily attacked by immune cells, however, the virus has developed viral proteins overtime that counteracts with the innate immune system (22) . some of the viral proteins antagonize interferon (inf) and stimulate inflammatory proteins, such as il-1 family member cytokines (23) . the inflammatory state and pathogenesis of the disease are escalated after abnormal production of cytokines as shown in sars (24) .our hypothesis is that the higher intake of fruits makes the persons at further risk of infection by the covid-19. despite fruits and vegetables have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant factors and have an important role in enhancing the immune system responses (25) . but higher intake of these micronutrients makes a barrier in improving the human immune system or response to the pathogens due to the role of the fruits with a high glycemic index. our study showed that beans and legumes have a positive role in reducing the infection rate by the covid-19. the human body requires the substates in the plant proteins to improve or respond to the vial pathogens because of the human body unable to produce these substrates (26) . therefore, the body needs these substates to protect the organs against the coronavirus. we assume that the immune body system unable to recognize the virus at the early times.comparison of dietary factors in countries with different infection rates therefore, the available proteins are essential for the body to make a response to the pathogen. the beans and legumes have been effective to reduce the rate of mortality by the covid-19 as well.the role of age in the suppression of the immune system must not be overlooked. the population of the countries with a higher infection rate is older compared to the counters with a low infection rate (27) . for example, france and italy compared to iraq and saudi arabia. the available evidence indicates that adults aged 60 years and older and patients with preexisting medical conditions are more likely to have sever-even deadly-coronavirus infection that other population groups (28) . therefore, we can make the further hypothesis that the aged population of the countries with high infection rates has been the main factor in the low immune system. the impacts of aging on the immune system can reflect at multiple levels. the levels are decreased production of b and t cells in bone marrow and thymus and diminished functions of mature lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues. so, the elderly persons do not respond to immune challenges as robustly as the young individual (29) . the higher intake of fruits and vegetables may not be beneficial to enhance the immune system in aged populations. diet alone may be insufficient and tailored micronutrient supplementation based on specific age-related needs necessary (7) .many micronutrients are required for immune-competence, especially vitamin a, c, d, e, bs, iron, selenium, and zinc. moreover, the dietary pattern is essential to maintain the nutritional status of an individual. however, the diet alone could not be adequate in certain metabolic and lifestyle conditions, such as elderlies, co-existing medical conditions, cigarette smoking, or occupational exposure to environmental toxins (7) . the fruits have several vitamins and minerals. the fruits at a ground level may not be quite suitable to make the final judgment.the older persons over the age of 60-65 experience some immune dysregulation with less ability to respond to immune challenges and response to pathogens, antigens, and mitogens decreases (30) . the decrease in the number of circulating lymphocytes and loss of immune cells are characteristics of the immune system in older people (31) . moreover, the older peoples have reduced the production of t cells in the involved thymus and consequently diminished function of mature lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues (29) . the lifetime of exposure to antigens and to several sources of oxidative stress cause dysregulation in the immune system that makes them at further risk of infections than other age groups (31) .the role of fruits in enhancing immunity, such as micronutrients is in exhibiting pleiotropic roles in supporting immune function. the vitamins and minerals support to develop and maintain the physical barriers, produce and activate antimicrobial proteins (32) . some other mechanisms of micronutrients are supporting the growth, differentiation, and motility/chemotaxis of innate cells; phagocytic and killing activities of neutrophils and macrophages, and promotion of and recovery from inflammation (e.g. cytokine production and antioxidant activity (32) .the potential mechanisms of the fruits may back to the antiviral immune induction, the modulation of immunoregulatory defense, induction of autophagy and apoptosis, genetic or epigenetic regulation (33) . stimulation of defensins and cathelicidins may reduce the replication of the virus and raise the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (34) . here our hypothesis is that a higher intake of fruits suppresses the role of stimulation of defensins and cathelicidins. the common denominator that reflects the role of nutrition and dietary recommendations against viral infections; including covid-19 is the relation between diet and immunity (35) . this is why we made our hypothesis based on the immunological effects of a higher intake of fruits in patients with covid-19 by taking into account the patients' ages. the evidence highlights that diet has an important effect on the immune system and disease vulnerability of peoples. the role of nutrients or nutrient combinations back to their effects on the immune system through the cell activation, modification in the production of signaling molecules, and gene expression (36) .the relation of fruits and beans and legumes on crude mortality rate is weak (p=0.047 and p=0.046, respectively) in contrast with the strong relation of sugar-sweetened beverages (ssbs) (p<0.001). the possible role of sugar-sweetened beverages on infection rate may back to its role in weight gain and the risk of obesity. a review study of observational and clinical trials showed that a higher intake of ssbs raised the risk of weight gain and obesity (37) . the evidence has been confirmed elsewhere (38, 39) . accordingly, maccioni et al. (40) recruited 1455 individuals aged 18-70 in a cross-sectional study on airway infection in germany. the study reported that obese persons have a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (rtis). the evidence has been reported elsewhere (41, 42) . obesity is responsible for the dysregulation of the immune system through mediation in different immune, metabolic, and thrombogenic responses (43) . the higher intake of ssbs has been reported in high-income countries (44) .the effect of higher calcium intake on raising infection rates could be due to the effect of calcium on the risk of some other chronic diseases rather than its direct effect. a meta-analysis showed the increased incidence of myocardial infarction in persons who consume higher levels of calcium with a pooled relative risk of 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.59, p=0.038 (45) . in addition, calcium has been reported as a trigger for ischemic cell death (46) .the daily recommended allowance/intake of the dietary factors are different across the countries. it is required to mention that food intake varies markedly based on the sociodemographic factors; like age gender, and educational level. we did not make stratification the results of the study based on the socio-demographic aspects since the who has not published the covid-19 confirmed cases according to age, gender, and educational level. besides, the cross-country caparison of individual-level dietary data is challenged by the dietary surveys performed with various survey characteristics and data collection methods with a possible influence in the comparison of the results. however, we used the fao dietary data that represent the nationally representative sample of all age-sex, and educational level categories.the present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by covid-19, respectively. in contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates. the possible reason for the role of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages on infection and mortally rates back to the indirect effect of weight gain and obesity and the role of age.the authors do not declare any conflicts of ineptest.this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (ncov). covid-19 is highly contagious, with more than 2.3 million cases and nearly 163 thousand deaths worldwide on april 21, 2020. (1, 2) the targeting organs of this coronavirus are believed to be the lungs and airways. however, patients often have evidence of damage to other organs, which significantly increases their mortality. (3, 4) the pathophysiological foundation of multiorgan damage may be associated with organ-specific immune response to disseminated coronavirus or secondary to hypoxemia, systemic cytokine storm, and medication. (5) in an attempt to determine the distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury in patients with covid-19 with a focus on clinical significance and determinants of this change, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included 5,771 patients in hubei province.in this multicenter retrospective cohort study, patients with covid-19 were admitted to the following in the study. exclusion criteria, which applied to 1,258 patients, were as follows: age younger than 18 or older than 75 years; pregnancy; severe medical conditions, including liver cirrhosis (10 cases), chronic renal dysfunction (above chronic kidney disease stage 3 [ckd 3]), leukemia, cancer, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, acute myocardial infarction during hospitalization, acute pulmonary embolism (due to a long-term pulmonary embolism disease history, long-term bed rest, and coagulopathy) stoke, and acute pancreatitis; or transfer to other hospitals (fig. 1 ).chest computed tomography (ct) or throat-swab specimens were obtained from all patients upon admission. covid-19 was diagnosed by clinical manifestations, chest ct, or real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) according to world health organization (who) interim guidance and the new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program (5th edition) published by the nationalthis article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved health commission of china. at the time of admission, patients with fever or suspected respiratory infection, plus one of the following clinical manifestations including respiratory rate greater than 30 breaths/minute, severe respiratory distress, or oxygen saturation (spo 2 ) less than 90% on room air, were classified as severe cases. (6) staging of covid-19 and evaluation of organ damages were conducted by a team of physicians. this study was approved by the central institutional ethics committee and ratified by each hospital. a waiver of the requirement for documentation of informed consent was granted for analyzing existing data without interfering with patient treatment.the demographic, clinical characteristics, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological reports, therapeutic intervention, and outcome data were obtained from patients' electronic medical records.clinical symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and comorbidities, were extracted. the laboratory examination included a complete blood count, c-reactive protein (crp), procalcitonin, ddimer, and serum biochemical tests for liver, kidney, heart, and coagulation dysfunction. medical history comprised coexistence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm), hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic liver disease, ckd, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. the unilateral and bilateral lesions in chest ct scan images were recorded and analyzed. personal identification information (e.g., name and id) of the study subjects was anonymized and replaced with a coding system before data extraction. data were reviewed and confirmed by experienced physicians and double-checked to ensure accuracy.acute lung injury (ali), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), and septic shock were defined according to the who interim guideline for "clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection is suspected." (4) acute kidney injury was defined as an elevation in serum creatinine level ≥26.5 μmol/l within 48 hours. (7) acute liver injury was defined as the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (alt) above 3-fold of the upper limit of normal (uln). increase in liver enzyme levels was defined as the levels of serum liver enzyme above the uln. cardiac injury was defined as the serum level of cardiac troponin i/t or hypersensitive troponin i/t above the uln. (8) clinical disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) was defined according to the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis (isth) criteria for diagnosingthis article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved dic. (9) the primary endpoint was recorded and evaluated in this longitudinal cohort, which was 28day all-cause death. data were reviewed and confirmed by two certified physicians to ensure accuracy.categorical variables were presented as frequency. continuous variables were described as median (interquartile range [iqr]). means for continuous variables were compared using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the mann-whitney test was used.proportions for categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test. proportions for categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or fisher exact test. distribution of highest liver enzyme levels (e.g., alt, ast, alp, and tbil) by the severity of covid-19 was presented using kernel density estimation. dynamic changes of liver enzyme levels by the severity of covid-19 were presented using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (loess). site was modeled as a random effect in the mixed-effect cox model. the mixed-effect cox proportional hazards regression models were used to investigate the relationship of liver enzyme levels with all-cause mortality among patients. the mixed-effect cox models were adjusted for age, gender, and coexisting chronic diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, t2dm, and ckd. ordinal logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the association of baseline characteristics and medications happened before peaking of liver enzymes with the peak levels of inhospital liver enzymes in the longitudinal cohort, where the liver function markers were trichotomized. the parallel lines assumption of the model was also tested and met. the p values were 2-sided, and an alpha level of 0.05 was used to define statistical significance. all analyses were conducted using r version 3.6.3 (r foundation for statistical computing, vienna, austria) or spss version 23.0 (ibm, armonk, ny, usa).the selected baseline liver characteristics of the enrolled patients are shown in table 1 . a total of 5,771 adult patients with covid-19 were included in the analysis. the median age was 56 (iqr, 43-accepted article (79.4%) were non-severe cases and 1,186 (20.6%) were classified as severe cases. a total of 81 (1.4%) patients reported chronic liver disease. among these patients, 4 recorded fatty liver diseases and 77 viral hepatitis (supporting table s3 ). the median day for acute liver injury (alt >3 uln) occurs at day 17 (iqr, 13-23) after symptom onset (fig. 1 ).to determine the distribution and trajectory of parameters indicating liver functions in patients enrolled in the study, multiple results from liver function tests were recorded during hospitalization. less disperse in non-severe cases. these levels increased and grew more disperse as the disease became more severe. non-severe and severe case distribution had widest separation by ast level (fig. 2b ). loess models illustrated trajectory of alt, ast, alp, and tbil in non-severe and severe patients during hospitalization (fig. 2c) . the models suggested a significant elevation of ast level upon admission and was maintained at higher levels in the severe group than the non-severe group. although there was a significant difference in alt between the non-severe group and the severe group, the magnitude of increase in alt was not as dramatic as ast upon admission.however, it rapidly increased, surpassed the uln value, and reached its peak within 10 to 15 days after admission in the severe group. alp level was higher in the severe group than the non-severe group. both groups rose gradually during hospitalization but largely stayed in the normal range. the fluctuation in tbil levels was mild in the non-severe and the severe group. the dynamic changes in indicators suggested potential mechanisms of covid-19-associated liver injury.impaired liver function is closely related to mortality in covid-19 patients. the associations of increased alt, ast, alp, and tbil levels with all-cause mortality were assessed using mixedeffect cox model. hospital sites were treated as a random effect. age, gender, and comorbidities were adjusted as confounders. hazard ratios for the associations between alt, ast, alp, and tbil andthis article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved all-cause mortality are depicted in table 2 . the kaplan-meier survival curves with elevation in alt, ast, alp, and tbil levels for all-cause mortality are illustrated in fig. 3 . among these liver enzymes, elevated ast was associated with the highest mortality risk. compared to the patients with ast in the normal range, all-cause mortality risk significantly increased 4.81-fold (95% confidence interval [ci], 3.38-6.86; p < 0.001) in patients with ast between 40 and 120 u/l and increased 14.87-fold (95% ci, 9.64-22.93; p < 0.001) in patients with ast above 120 u/l after adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities. moreover, elevation of other enzymes and tbil were also significantly associated with adverse outcomes of covid-19 (table 2 and supporting table s4 -s5).given discharge might be a competing risk for death, we further analyzed the association of liver function with 28-day mortality of covid-19 using cumulative risk analysis, to further avoid the potential over-estimation of risk in the hazard estimates. in this model, ast ranging from 40 to 120 u/l and above 120 u/l were associated with significantly increased the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hr, 6.00; 95%ci, 4.29-8.39; p < 0.001 for 40-120 u/l; adjusted hr, 17.05; 95%ci, 11.21-25.93; p < 0.001 for ast >120 u/l) (supporting table s6)the ordinal regression analysis revealed the effects of age, sex, and coexisting disease-adjusted baseline characteristics and hospital medication on peak alt, ast, alp, and tbil levels in covid-19 patients from the longitudinal cohort (tables 3) . male gender, systemic corticosteroids application, lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and fever were factors positively associated with elevated alt levels ( table 3) . use of antifungal drugs, lymphocyte count decrease, chronic liver disease, systemic corticosteroids use, and male gender were the leading factors positively associated with elevated ast levels. alp levels were tightly associated with antifungal drug use, neutrophil counts increase, chronic liver disease, and male gender. antifungal, antiviral, systemic corticosteroids use, and platelet count reduction were main factors positively correlated with increased tbil levels. neutrophil count increase, lymphocyte count decrease, and male gender were common factors positively associated with elevated alt, ast, alp, and tbil levels during hospitalization (table 3) .this article is protected by copyright. all rights reservedmultiorgan injury, which significantly increases mortality, is often evident in patients with covid-19. (10) this study presents trajectories of liver enzyme levels during hospitalization and depicts their clinical significance in a multicenter retrospective cohort-derived data set of 5,771 individuals. liver injury was mild and transient in non-severe patients. the major finding is that elevation of ast level was more frequent and significant than the increase of alt in severe patients on hospital admission, and ast levels had the highest correlation with mortality compared to other indicators reflecting liver injury. this is contradictory to other hepatitis-induced liver injury. increase of alp was more significant toward the latter phase of the disease but mainly stayed within the normal range. elevated alt, ast, alp, and tbil levels were associated with increased risks of mortality and, among these liver enzymes, elevated ast was associated with the highest mortality risk. common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, dyspnea, and male gender.the liver biopsy specimens of patients with covid-19 showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal lesion. (5, 11) liver damage may be associated with organ-specific immune response to coronavirus or secondary to hypoxemia, systemic inflammation response, and medication.a previous study showed the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor expression is very low in hepatocytes and only expressed in cholangiocytes in the liver, (12) suggesting that cholangiocytes might be a direct target for severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-coronavirus 2 (cov-2) invading the liver. however, in our study, alp, an index of cholangiocytes injury, mainly stayed within the normal range during hospitalization. elevation in alt and ast, the indicators of hepatocyte injury, was more common and severe in patients with covid-19. pathological analysis of liver tissue from a patient who died from covid-19 failed to demonstrate cholangiocyte damage and viral infiltration in the liver. the elevations of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (ggt), which also reflect bile duct injury, were not significant. (5) thus, the hypothesis of cholangiocytes mediating viral-associated injury needs further investigation.in this study, we observed ast elevation upon admissions, followed by an increase in alt. previous studies also reported that ast increase is more frequent than alt in severe patients upon admission. (3, 13) this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved in which alt elevation is the primary manifestation of liver injury. (14) (15) (16) ordinal regression analysis also showed that ast elevation is positively correlated with the increase of neutrophil counts and the decrease of lymphocyte counts at baseline-pathological alterations that are proven indicators of disease severity. (17, 18) early elevation in ast and its association with indicators for disease severity suggest immune-mediated inflammation may play a critical role in liver impairment in severe patients with covid-19. mechanisms that mediate the early ast elevation in severe patients warrant further study.the combination of antibiotics, antivirals, and systemic corticosteroids is widely utilized in covid-19 treatment. (13, 19) antifungal medication is more likely to be applied in weaker patients. in this study, use of antifungal drugs, antibiotics, antivirals, and systemic corticosteroids exhibited a positive correlation with elevated liver enzymes. although these data could not prove the causal effect of drugs on liver damage, drug hepatotoxicity during the treatment of coronavirus infection needs to be considered.due to this emergent situation, there is an insufficient report and diagnosis on chronic liver disease.only 81 patients recorded history of chronic liver disease (4 with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease[nafld] and 77 with viral hepatitis), which are much lower than the prevalence in china. (20, 21) we are unable to assess whether coexistence of chronic liver comorbidities increases susceptibility to liver injury in sars-cov-2 infection. previous studies have shown that sars-cov-2 may aggravate liver injury in patients with viral hepatitis. (22, 23) therefore, liver injury in patients with chronic liver disease needs to be investigated and monitored.limitations exist in our research. this study was retrospective, and some cases did not have sufficient history of illness. the multiple tests for liver function were carried out at different time intervals for each patient. bias may occur due to the increased number of tests in patients with liver dysfunction.observational studies demonstrate association, not causation. whether abnormal liver function is caused by sars-cov-2 or inflammation needs to be further investigated by direct clinical evidence.in conclusion, the dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the covid-19-associated liver injury. because the increase of liver injury indicators is strongly associated with the risk of mortality, these parameters, especially ast, may need to be monitored during hospitalization. this article is protected

lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) [2] . by 4 feb 2020 a total 24,324 cases have been confirmed infection nationwide with 3,219 severe cases, 490 death cases, and another 23,260 suspected cases [3] . reports also been released of exported cases in many other countries. who had determined this situation should be deemed a public health emergency of international concern on 30 jan 2020 [4] . symptoms of 2019-ncov infected pneumonia (ncip) include fever and/or respiratory illness, lymphopenia, and radiologic abnormality [5] [6] [7] , among these clinical features, radiologic characteristics of ncip are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. we herein summarize the clinical and radiologic characteristics of 27 confirmed cases and analyze the association of radiologic findings with mortality cases.this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review boards of hubei public health clinical center, the central hospital of wuhan, and written informed consent was it was calculated as: for upper zone (a), 3 (consolidation) × 3 (50-75% distribution) × 2 (both right and left

+ 2 (ground glass opacity) × (2 (25-50% distribution of the right lung) + 1 (< 25% distribution of the left lung)). all patients were treated with intravenous ribavirin 0.5g twice daily and/or oral oseltamivir 75 mg, twice daily. antibiotics, including levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, sulbactam and cefoperazone, piperacillin and meropenem were used. some patients also received glucocorticoid and/ or intravenous immunoglobulin administration.the technical parameters included 64-section scanner with 1 mm collimation at 5 mm intervals. all ct examinations were performed with the patient in the supine position and with breath-holding following inspiration, without administration of contrast material. images were obtained with both mediastinal (width 350 hu; level 40 hu) and parenchymal (width 1500 hu; level -600 hu) window settings. two experienced pulmonologists (yml, yw) reviewed the images independently, with a final finding reached by consensus when there was a discrepancy. ct findings included ground glass opacity, consolidation, air bronchogram and nodular opacities. ground glass opacity (ggo) was defined as hazy areas of increased opacity or attenuation without concealing the underlying vessels. consolidation was defined as homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma obscuring the underlying vessels. air bronchogram was defined as a pattern of air-filled (low-attenuation) bronchi on a background of opaque (high-attenuation) airless lung. nodular opacities were defined as focal round opacities either solid nodules or ggos (diameter � 3 cm). the presence of lymphadenopathy was defined as a lymph node � 1 cm in short-axis diameter.the ct scans were scored on the axial images referring to the method described previously [9] . the extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed independently for each of 3 zones: upper (above the carina), middle (below the carina and above the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein). the location of the lesion was defined as peripheral if it was in the outer one-third of the lung, or as central otherwise. the ct findings were graded on a 3-point scale: 1 as normal attenuation, 2 as ground-glass attenuation, and 3 as consolidation. each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones in each patient, was assigned a following scale according to distribution of the affected lung parenchyma: 0 as normal, 1 as < 25% abnormality, 2 as 25-50% abnormality, 3 as 50-75% abnormality, and 4 as > 75% abnormality. the four-point scale of the lung parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above. points from all zones were added for a final total cumulative score, with value ranging from 0 to72 (fig 1) . continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range, iqr) and compared with the mann-whitney u test or wilcoxon test; categorical variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by χ 2 test or fisher's exact test if appropriate. a two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. statistical analyses were done using the spss (version 16.0). table 1 , the 27 patients diagnosed as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infected pneumonia (ncip) included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (iqr 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition with twice negative test for 2019-ncov viral rna in throat-swab specimens and 10 patients died in hospital. the median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (iqr 63-73) vs 55 (iqr 35-60), p = 0.003). the comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, p = 0.018), especially comorbid hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease. 11 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and required non-invasive ventilator mechanical ventilation, 10 of whom died, and one 36 years old man (oxygenation index: 184 mmhg) recovered after treatment. there were no significant differences between survival group and mortality group with respect to patient sex and symptoms. the ct features, including the location, extent and distribution of involvement of each abnormality were shown in table 2 . the median days of ct scans were 8 (iqr 5-11) before symptom onset in all patients. the predominant ct characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involved (96%). lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were relatively seldom seen (0% and 4%). the median ct score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (iqr 7-13) vs 12 (iqr 11-43), p = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, p = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, p = 0.025) (fig 2) .in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (fig 3) , an optimal cutoff value of a ct score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.901 (95% confidence interval: 0.873, 0.928).initial and reexamined ct features on day 15 (iqr 9-18) after symptom onset in survival group were compared in 11 patients. as shown in fig 4, some cases exhibited a certain degree of progression, however the morphology of the lesions, the location, extent and distribution of involvement of each abnormality were not significantly changed compared to those on admission (table 3 ). in mortality group, ct scores progressed rapidly in a short time (12 (iqr 5-24.5) vs 20 (iqr 15-46), p = 0.042), with more lung zones being involved (table 4 ). a novel coronavirus (ncov) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans [10] . the 2019-ncov causes symptoms similar to sars based on recent clinical data [5, 6] , and is capable of spreading from human to human and between cities, with very contagious characteristic [11] . the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 [12] . the mortality of the 27 included patients infected by 2019-ncov was 37%, which is much higher than that reported 2% on 4 feb 2020 [3] . giving the priority of 2019-ncov detection to severe cases because of shortness of test kits in our hospital initially and potential false negative results of 2019-ncov viral rna detection in mild cases might account for this discrepancy. consistent with recent reports, our results suggest that 2019-ncov is more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune functions of these patients [5, 6] , and 2019-ncov-associated death is also related to elder age and underlying illnesses, especially hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac disease.consistently with several recent reports regarding to ct findings of 2019-ncov infected pneumonia (ncip) [13] [14] [15] , our results showed that ct manifestations of ncip were featured by predominant ground glass opacities (ggo) (67%) mixed with consolidations (30%), mainly peripheral (26%) or combined peripheral and central distributions (74%), bilateral (86%) and lower lung zones (96%) being mostly involved. merely consolidation, central distribution only, pleural effusions or lymphadenopathy were relatively rarely seen. initially the ct images might be ggo nodules or patchy ggo mostly peripherally distributed then consolidations and extensive distributions were seen when pneumonia progressed. consolidation, air bronchogram, extensive distribution as well as multiple involved lung zones were more common in mortality group, suggesting a more severe clinical course for these abnormalities can be pathologically correlated with diffuse alveolar damage and similar conclusions can be drawn in h1n1 pneumonia, h5n1 pneumonia, h7n9 pneumonia and sars [9, [16] [17] [18] . as members of the same virus family, ncip shared much common ground with mers and sars in ct features. subpleural and basilar airspace lesions with ggos and consolidations were conspicuous ct characteristics of all three kinds of virus pneumonia, but pleural effusions are more common in patients who died of mers [19] [20] [21] [22] . comprehensively evaluated the ct features of ncip, we calculated the ct score of each patient. the ct scores were much higher in mortality group compared to survival group (30 (iqr 7-13) vs 12 (iqr 11-43), 0.021), p = 0.021) on admission. in mortality group the scores markedly increased in a short time (12 (iqr 5-24.5) vs 20 (iqr 15-46), p = 0.042), suggesting a progressive course of ncip. although the ct scores were not diminished, they maintained a relatively stable level for a period of time in survival group (12 (iqr 6-12) vs 12 (iqr 6-15), p = 0.237), suggesting that it might take a long time to recover in chest imaging when ncip was under controlled. we found an optimal cutoff value of a ct score of 24.5 (sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.5%) to predict mortality. we hope the simple scoring method according to ct scans may help triage patients and screening patients who need more aggressive treatment and closely monitoring. however, the efficacy of such approach to decrease mortality remains to be validated in future studies. although a definite diagnosis of ncip cannot be achieved by using imaging features alone for most viral pneumonia imaging patterns share similarity, the ct features summarized above might be helpful in differentiation various pathogens of pneumonia and in triage patients.there were limitations in our study. first it was a retrospective study including only 27 inpatients, while outpatients and suspected but undiagnosed cases for deficiency of detection kits of 2019-ncov and potential false negative results were ruled out. second, not all information was collected because a significant part of patients had not rechecked ct scans. then, it was pulmonologists, although they are experienced, who evaluated ct images. finally there was a lack of information regarding interobserver agreement, because the study emphasis on the final consensus interpretation rather than independent reading.pandemics: environments, behaviors, and inequalities "an epidemic erodes social cohesiveness because the source of your danger is your fellow human beings, the source of your danger is your wife, children, parents and so on. so, if an epidemic goes on long enough, and the bodies start to pile up and nobody can dig graves fast enough to put the people into them, then morality does start to break down." [1] dr. alfred crosby america's forgotten pandemic: the influenza of 1918 across millennia, disease outbreaks have impacted societies and reinforced the human perception of frailty and mortality [2] . dramatic demographic shifts in the past century have escalated the difficulty in containing a pandemic and the rise of globalization and urbanization have facilitated the rapid spread of pathogens from one continent to another in a flight of just a few hours. yet, when a comparison is drawn between the 2019 coronavirus pandemic and the 1918 influenza pandemic, the most widely available tools to respond to these disease outbreaks have remained nearly the same. public health interventions have been and are still the first line of defense against a pandemic in the absence of a vaccine [3] . understanding that the environment plays a significant role in disease dynamics and in determining the health of individuals has always been an essential aspect to controlling and managing infectious diseases. for example, the history of urban planning in the past century has highlighted how built environments can have an effect on preventing both chronic and infectious diseases [4] . however, the function of human behaviors and social ideologies stemmed from the darker side of humanity must also be acknowledged as an important component to determining who lives and who survives during the deadliest periods of disease pandemics.in the midst of world war i, the influenza pandemic spread worldwide during 1918-1919 and was outstanding in its lethality [5] . while there is not a universal consensus on the pandemic's origin it is understood to have been was caused by a h1n1 subtype of an influenza a virus with avian and swine genetic origins [6] [7] [8] . over the course of the pandemic, an estimated one third of the world's population, approximately 500 million persons, became infected and the total deaths were estimated at 50 million or arguably as high as 100 million [7] . historically, the curve of influenza deaths in humans has been u-shaped, with peaks among infants and the elderly. nevertheless, this 1918 influenza pandemic exhibited a w-shape age-related fatality with the addition of a third peak among young adults [7, 9] . as such, death rates for individuals 15 to 34 years of age were 20 times higher than in previous years [7, 10] .the influenza pandemic occurred in three distinctive waves over a 12-month period in europe, asia and north america. the first wave of the pandemic, which began in spring 1918 and lasted approximately six months, was not particularly virulent and mimicked typical seasonal flu symptomology and mortality [7, 8, 11] . however, due to a possible viral mutation over the course of the summer and wartime troop movements, this first wave was then followed by a rapid succession of more fatal second and third waves in the autumn of 1918 (september-november) and the winter and spring of 1919 (january-may), respectively [7, [12] [13] [14] [15] . in the united states, the first outbreak of flu-like illnesses was detected in march 1918 with more than 100 cases at camp funston in fort riley, kansas [16, 17] . within a week, the number of influenza cases quintupled throughout the army installation [16] . by the end of the month, approximately 1100 soldiers were hospitalized and 38 had died after developing pneumonia [18] . nevertheless, thousands of soldiers were continually deployed for world war i and traveled across the atlantic ocean. in europe, the disease first appeared in april 1918 among american soldiers in a military camp near bordeaux, france [5, 17] . the influenza presentation was in the form of a benign fever accompanied by cold-like symptoms and the attending american doctors believed the underlying cause was haemophilus influenzae, a pathogenic bacterium formally called pfeiffer's bacillus [19] . the spring 1918 wave of influenza affected nearly 15,000 soldiers from april to july, but only five american soldiers died [19] . although the mortality of this first pandemic wave was minor in comparison to the waves to come, spain was the first european country in which the disease spread to wide sectors of the population, thus causing a significant level of mortality. in may and june 1918, there were 276 influenza deaths in madrid, which represented a mortality rate of 0.42 deaths per 1000 people [19] . during this same period, another 852 unconfirmed influenza deaths were attributed to different respiratory system pathologies. if these unconfirmed deaths were combined with the confirmed influenza deaths, the mortality rate would have been 1.31 per 1000 people, the highest mortality figure traceable to this pandemic [19] . up until this point, very little was written or documented about the strain of the outbreak or its epidemiologic indications due to wartime censorship, however this mortality rate from one single etiological agent could not be overlooked. in may 1918, the spanish newspaper el sol first published a report about a "sickness which ha [d] not yet been diagnosed by doctors" and headlines around the world labeled this as one of the worst pandemics in human history [19, 20] . thus, the derivation of "spanish influenza" was conceived [5] .in september 1918, the second, and most deadly, wave of the pandemic emerged within the united states [21] . soldiers at camp devens, an army training camp just outside of boston, massachusetts, and sailors aboard the receiving ship at commonwealth pier in boston began reporting flu-like symptoms [16, 22] . by month's end, more than 14,000 cases were reported at camp devens, approximately one-quarter of the total camp, and 757 soldiers succumbed to influenza [16] . the massachusetts department of health informed local newspapers of the epidemic and stated that, "unless precautions are taken the disease in all probability will spread to the civilian population of the city" [22] . at the nearby navy radio school within harvard university in cambridge, massachusetts, cases of influenza were reported among the group of 5000 young men studying radio communications. as 1918 concluded, cambridge experienced 3014 cases of influenza among its meager population of 109,000 residents, ultimately leading to a mortality rate of 541 per 100,000 [23] . during this time in new york state, the board of health in new york city, added influenza to the list of reportable diseases, and required all cases to be isolated at home or in a city hospital [16] . moreover, in a document entitled "fighting influenza with transit systems", the board of health adopted a plan to set operation schedules for many business, which would then elongate the time window for transit service and reduce congestion [24, 25] . in lieu of subway suspension, royal copeland, the city health commissioner "staggered workdays by industry, so that instead of everyone arriving at work at 9:00 [am], some were to come in later or earlier" [26] . other cities, such as seattle, washington, followed suit in controlling the transmission of influenza within public transit environments by requiring passengers to wear face masks before boarding streetcars (figure 1 ) [27] . interestingly, commissioner copeland did not issue an order to close schools or the prohibition of public gatherings at theaters in new york city. he stated that his rational to not "[issue] general closing orders and making a public flurry over the situation was to keep down the danger of panic" and that he "wanted people to go about their business without constant fear and hysterical sense of calamity" [29] . unlike new york city, public gatherings were prohibited and social distancing was encouraged with the closure of theaters, movie houses and night schools in other cities, namely chicago, illinois; reno, nevada; and madison, wisconsin [30, 31] . there was also a call for volunteers to help nurse the infirmed in chicago and other cities throughout the united states due to the severe deficit of professional nurses, a shortage resulting from the deployment of nurses to military camps and the failure to use trained african american nurses [16] . despite the social distancing efforts employed in new york city and chicago, philadelphia, pennsylvania choose to ignore these initiatives. on september 28, 1918 , the city held its fourth liberty loan drive, a parade that gathered over 200,000 philadelphians. within days after the parade, over 1000 people were dead, another 200,000 cases of influenza were reported, every bed in the city's 31 hospitals was filled, and the city was forced to close churches, schools, theaters and all other places of "public amusement" [22, 32, 33] . a week after the parade, 2600 philadelphians had died [34] . with the pile up of corpses in philadelphia, cold-storage plants were used as temporary morgues and a trolley car manufacturer donated 200 packing crates to be used as coffins [16] . by early october, single day influenza deaths reached record numbers in philadelphia (289 deaths-october 6, 1918) and new york city (851 deaths-october 15, 1918) [22] . the virus continued to journey westward to louisiana, texas, new mexico, utah, california, and washington. the wearing of six-ply gauze masks became mandatory in washington and parts of california [16, 22] . for example, in san francisco, california, individuals were fined $5 u.s. dollars (usd), an equivalent of approximately $85 usd today, if they were seized in public without face masks [33] . in salt lake city, utah, officials placed quarantine signs on the doors of 2000 homes where occupants had been infected with influenza [16] . the end of the second wave, which left its mark as being the deadliest of all three waves, coincided with the end of world war i on november 11, 1918 [11,21] . as people celebrated armistice day with parades and large gatherings, a public health calamity was lurking with an influenza resurgence in some cities [16, 22] . by december 1918, the second wave of the pandemic had passed, but the health threat was far from over.in australia, a third wave erupted in january 1919 and eventually drifted back to europe and the united states [18] . there were 1800 cases and 101 deaths reported in the first five days of january in san francisco and on the other side of the country in new york city, 706 cases and 67 deaths were reported [16] . even though eradication of influenza appeared in louisiana and washington, many residents in san antonia, texas began complaining that a new surge of influenza cases were not being reported [16, 22] . as a precautionary measure, states like massachusetts and illinois began to request special appropriations for the study of influenza treatment and to train women as "practical nurses" in response to the nursing shortage [16] . the nursing shortage was so dire in some areas of the country that the american red cross asked local businesses to grant workers a day off if they volunteered in the hospitals at night [35] . the mortality rate of the third wave was just as high as the second wave, but the end of the war eliminated the conditions that enabled the rapid and widespread transmission of the virus. deaths from the third wave paled in comparison to the annihilation during the second wave [18] . with one-quarter of the american population infected with influenza, the pandemic was affecting everyone. it was believed that president woodrow wilson contracted the virus in april 1919 while negotiating the treaty of versailles to end world war i [18] . the pandemic finally came to an end during the summer of 1919, although a very minor fourth wave appeared in spring 1920 throughout isolated areas of new york city. the pandemic ended simply because individuals who were infected either died or developed immunity. with an estimated death toll of 675,000 people in the united states, the pandemic lowered the average life expectancy by more than 12 years [10] .during world war i, the worst cases of the influenza pandemic came from overcrowded military barracks and ships with poor ventilation [36] . it was quickly found that one way to heal infected wounds was to expose patients to sunlight and open-air. in june 1915, sir arthur everett shipley, an eminent scientist of the time, determined that open-air treatment of infirmed and wounded soldiers at the first eastern general hospital was a success, particularly for those with influenza related pneumonia [37, 38] . when the pandemic clinched the united states, health officials converted schools, halls, and large private houses to emergency and open-air hospitals [37] . as such, open-air hospitals became a common practice by the time of the 1918 pandemic [39, 40] . a combination of outdoor air and sunlight reduced the number of infections and deaths reported at open-air hospitals. specifically, medics found that regular meals, warmth, and plenty of fresh air and sunlight helped severely ill patients recover better than indoor nursed patients [41] . researchers also revealed that healthcare facilities designed with high ceilings and large windows had the same effect as open-air hospitals [42] . accordingly, natural ventilation and fresh air was the best way to prevent the transmission of influenza as well as other infectious diseases [43] . open-air therapy was one of the popular techniques in dealing with common and often deadly respiratory infections of the time until antibiotics replaced it in the 1950s [44] .in the absence of a vaccine for novel pathogens and antibiotics to protect against influenza secondary bacterial infections, many authorities suggested non-pharmaceutical interventions for the control of a pandemic [45, 46] . social distancing had become the most well-established non-pharmaceutical public health measure to slow the spread of communicable diseases. social distancing measures were implemented through the closing of schools, restaurants, and theaters as well as the banning and restriction of public gatherings and transportation among cities in the united states during the 1918 pandemic [3] . the point of initiation, duration and decision to relax social distancing measures profoundly impacted mortality rates during this period [47] . for example, cities such as philadelphia (748 deaths per 100,000 at 24 weeks), that initiated social distancing measures later and for shorter periods tended to have spikes in deaths and overall higher death rates ( figure 2 ) [3, 48] . in philadelphia, the first cases of the influenza appeared on september 17, 1918 [47] . however, the philadelphia public health director, dr. wilmer krusen, understated the risk of disease transmission. dr. krusen assured people that sick soldiers were suffering from casual seasonal influenza, which could be avoided by staying warm. he allowed large public gatherings, notably the fourth liberty loan drive parade on september 28, 1918 as mentioned previously. as a result, philadelphia experienced a mortality acceleration that was 360% higher than the average american city [49] . in comparison, cities, such as minneapolis, minnesota (267 deaths per 100,000 at 24 weeks), that ordered social distancing measures sooner and for longer periods slowed the transmission rate and lowered overall death rates [3, 48] . furthermore, cities that relaxed social distancing measures prematurely, experienced multiple spikes in deaths. this was observed in st. louis, missouri. due to its low death rate, the city lifted restrictions on public gatherings less than two months after the influenza outbreak began. however, a sharp and higher spike of new cases soon followed [3, 48] . research comparing 17 american cities has suggested that the implementation of early interventions to control the spread of influenza may have significantly decreased the rate of transmission and mortality observed [47] . cities across the united states, including milwaukee, wisconsin and indianapolis, indiana, had the most effective interventions and reduced transmission rates by up to 30-50% [50] . the lower level of mortality was due to the quick public health response in the first days of the epidemic and the introduction of broad measures designed to promote social distancing [47, 50] . initially, the american medical community minimized the scale and scope of the influenza pandemic to create a false sense of security in the country's largest cities, including philadelphia [11] . yet, this was an issue beyond the medical community; this was a public health crisis that brought to light urban environment deficiencies, namely the proliferation of municipal waste and unsanitary living conditions [51] . while not always well understood, the presence and threat of infectious diseases has shaped urban planning in the united states. during this early 20th century pandemic, urban environments in new york city, chicago and other american cities were densely populated and characterized by crowded tenement housing in proximity to factories, animal yards, and slaughterhouses with little airflow or light [4, 52] . even before the 1918 influenza outbreak, cities were plagued with cholera, tuberculosis and typhoid epidemics [4] . medical models, specifically the miasma theory, an idea that diseases were caused by a noxious form of "bad air", prevailed, but there was also a sense that the congestion, pollution, lack of sunshine and poor airflow contributed to illness [4, 52] . in response, urban planning efforts introduced zoning to spatially segregate residential, commercial and industrial uses and housing regulations to require light and airflow in order to improve overcrowding and unsanitary urban living conditions [4, 52] . during the 1918 pandemic, urban reformers and engineers again tried to prevent infection by improving waste removal and housing quality and creating technological enhancements to control environmental nuisances and hazards, but trivial cooperation from municipal government leadership and interference of the private interest sector often blocked immediate and effective action [51] . as a result, the "schism in the public health community" ultimately impacted the lives of millions [53] ."epidemic diseases [have not been] random events that afflicte[d] societies capriciously and without warning"; they typically unfold across a wide spectrum of communities that are diverse by race, age, gender, and socioeconomic status [54, 55] . the 1918 pandemic affected the youngest and wealthiest people without any boundaries. racially, the composition of the country during this time was predominately "black and white" and up until this point, medical and public health reports had documented that african americans suffered higher morbidity and mortality rates for several diseases in comparison to white americans [56] . specifically, w.e.b. du bois, a prominent sociologist and civil rights activist, found through an analysis of the 1900 u.s. census that the african american mortality rates were two to three times higher for several diseases, including tuberculosis, pneumonia, and diarrheal disease, in comparison to the white american mortality rates [57] . dubois argued that these disparities reflected social conditions and not racial susceptibilities [57] . in poor and working-class urban neighborhoods, social conditions, like overcrowded housing, poor sanitation service, and unsafe drinking increased the vulnerability of influenza [51] . in 1910, the u.s. census set 2500 as the minimum population threshold for the urban category and by the 1920 u.s. census over 50% of the american population was defined as urban [58] . before the onset of the pandemic, urban environments within american cities were composed of a predominantly (93.45%) white population [59] . during this period, more than 90% of the african american population lived in southern parts of the united states, but millions began migrating to the north in search of better job opportunities and living conditions [60] . with this first great migration from the rural south to northern cities, starting in 1910, a larger share of african americans lived in urban areas during the 1918 pandemic [61] . still, on average and in comparison to white americans, fewer african americans, less than 5%, lived in high population density urban areas, which were the epicenters of the outbreak [62] . hence, the norms of disease morbidity and mortality for african americans changed during the pandemic. during the second wave in fall 1918, african americans had lower influenza morbidity and mortality rates, but a higher case fatality rate, in comparison to the white population [63] . this was an unexpected phenomenon as african americans were expected to have higher influenza morbidity and mortality. explanations for this 1918 pandemic norm crossover have included: (1) an unequal exposure based on where african americans lived (e.g., urban vs. rural environments); (2) a higher exposure to the less virulent spring wave, which provided some african americans with immunity; (3) a military segregation, which allowed for less crowding among african american soldiers; and (4) an underreporting of influenza cases and deaths for african americans [63] . while there has been no evidence that the first spring wave was especially rampant in the south to induce a higher influenza exposure among the majority of african americans living in rural southern areas, there has been a clear understanding that the first great migration left a large portion of african americans in cramped, dilapidated, impoverished and segregated conditions with less access to sanitation and urban social programs in northern cities. the segregated african american neighborhoods may have functioned as a makeshift quarantine. yet, in cities, such as baltimore, maryland and detroit, michigan, the segregation created crowded urban ghettoes where tuberculosis became one of the top three causes of death among urban african americans [64] . individuals with tuberculosis lung damage were more susceptible to influenza, which would explain why a higher proportion of african american influenza cases developed pneumonia and also had higher case fatality rates during the second wave [63] . the entrenched racial and economic discrimination within the united states seemed to have both protected and endangered african americans to the 1918 pandemic.throughout world war i, many doctors had been called into military service and the shortage of the doctors, nurses, and medical staff caused hospitals to reject patients, particularly african americans [56] . the american red cross served as the recruiter of nurses for the army. with the racial discriminatory practices of the american red cross, african american women who tried to gain entry as nurses were rebuffed. while the devastation of the pandemic forced the army to drop its ban on african american nurses, the racial discrimination still surpassed the need for healthcare in some areas. the november 2, 1918, edition of the chicago defender reported that the dean of ohio's hiram college refused to allow an african american nurse named olive walker to care for influenza patients at the college [56, 65] . african american doctors also found the color line to be rigid in trying to care for white americans during this time [66] . racism and legalized segregation restricted african americans and other non-white americans access to healthcare professionals and facilities. in cities across the nation, african americans received substandard care in segregated hospitals or in confined hospitals that served only african americans. many infected people died without seeing a doctor due to the sheer number of bodies that overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and the heavy burden of the medical staff [67] . african american influenza patients exceeded the limit of the frederick douglass memorial hospital, one of philadelphia's two african american hospitals, and pushed the medical director to establish an "emergency annex" in an african american parochial school [56] . in richmond, virginia, african american patients received care in a hospital basement until the city opened a separate hospital staffed by african americans at an elementary school [56, 68] . the baltimore afro-american newspaper criticized provident hospital, the only african american facility in the city, for turning patients away [56, 69] . a prohibition on public gatherings that included funerals and wakes prevented families from properly grieving. many victims were buried without coffins or were thrown into unmarked burial grounds. native americans, who practiced different burial practices, became exposed to the virus at alarming rates. in september 1918, more than 2000 navajos died of influenza in apache county, new mexico [22] . across the country, mass graves were dug to accommodate the pile of corpses [36] . african american bodies, in particular, were neglected by the general public infrastructure. in baltimore, sanitation department employees refused to dig graves for african american influenza victims after the city's only african american cemetery could not accommodate any more graves [65] .the 1918 pandemic took a heavy human toll on entire families and communities. with the devastation and bereavement, violence erupted in some areas. people were shot for not wearing masks and rates of homicides and suicides skyrocketed [22] . white supremacist ideologies and racist scientific theories advanced bigoted and false notions of the biological, physiological, and moral inferiority of african americans when they were blamed for the pandemic [56] . throughout the first great migration period, african americans were highly visible and thought of as "diseases". the 1918 pandemic heightened these existing prejudices, which were further reinforced by contemporary newspaper headlines, such as "rush of negroes to city starts health inquiry"; "negros arrive by thousands-peril to health"; or "negro influx brings disease" [70] . the memory of the 1918 pandemic left a lasting blemish on public health planning and practice and reflected the moral relationships and deterioration of humanity during that period. the magnitude of events and death with the influenza pandemic have served as a reference point and hopefully as a severe, if not, "worst-case" scenario.in december 2019, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), was detected in the wuhan, hubei province of the people's republic of china [71] . in the following weeks, infections spread across china and other countries around the world [72, 73] . covid-19 was first confirmed to have spread to the united states in january 2020 when a 35-year-old man returned to washington state on january 15, 2020 after traveling to visit family in wuhan, china was diagnosed [74] . on january 30, 2020, the first case of person-to-person covid-19 transmission was confirmed in the united states between a married couple after a 60-year-old wife returned from china [75] . she subsequently became symptomatic and transmitted the infection to her husband. by march 11, 2020, there were over 125,000 cases and 4500 deaths worldwide [76] . as such, the world health organization classified the covid-19 outbreak a pandemic. as of june 21, 2020, there were over two million confirmed cases and 119,810 deaths in the united states [77] . these numbers, however, to do include the thousands of americans, such as an estimated 5200 people in new york city, who died without being tested for covid-19.the coronavirus pandemic in the united states, which has the highest number of known cases in the world, exploded over the course of march and april 2020. at the start of march, most of the cases were tied to overseas travel and there was extremely limited testing available. in many parts of the country, such as in new york, maryland, indiana, north carolina and louisiana, there was a period when the number of cases was doubling every 7 to 14 days [77] . one precipitating source of community transmission unique to covid-19 has been cruise ships. cruise ships have previously been settings for infectious diseases outbreaks because of their compact closed environments, contact with travelers from many countries and crew transfers between ships. more than 800 confirmed covid-19 cases occurred on the diamond princess and grand princess cruise ship voyages, the latter of which sailed roundtrip, departing san francisco from february 11 to 7 march 2020 [78] . four stops were made in mexico (voyage a) and most of the 1,111 crew and 68 passengers from voyage a remained on board for a second voyage that departed san francisco on 21 february 2020 (voyage b), with a planned return on 7 march 2020 [78] . a healthcare provider in california reported two patients, who had traveled on voyage a, with covid-19 symptoms and one of whom with a confirmed positive covid-19 test. subsequently, more than 20 additional covid-19 cases among voyage a passengers were confirmed in california. on 5 march 2020, a centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) response team was transported by helicopter to the grand princess cruise ship to collect specimens from 45 passengers and crew with covid-19 respiratory symptoms. among these 45 individuals, 21 (46.7%) had positive covid-19 test results, which included two passengers and 19 crew members. this high attack rate among passengers and crew has been partially attributed to a high proportion of asymptomatic infections. until disembarkation, passengers and symptomatic crew members were asked to self-quarantine in their cabins and room service replaced public dining. when the grand princess cruise ship docked in oakland, california on 8 march 2020, everyone was transferred to land-based sites for a 14-day quarantine period. as of 21 march 2020, 78 (16.6%) of 469 persons with available test had positive covid-19 test results. additional covid-19 cases linked to several additional cruises were also reported across the united states [78] . by march 17, 2020, the cruise lines international association announced a 30-day voluntary suspension of cruise operations in the united states and the cdc issued a level 3 travel warning for all cruise travel to be deferred worldwide.the first preliminary description of outcomes among covid-19 patients in the united states was reported in march 2020 by the cdc. this report indicated that fatality was highest in persons aged ≥85, ranging from 10% to 27%. this was then followed by persons aged 65-84 years (3% to 11%), aged 55-64 years (1% to 3%), aged 20-54 years (<1%), and aged ≤19 years (0%) [79] . pediatric (<18 years) covid-19 cases, less than 2% of the total cases in the united states, have demonstrated much milder symptoms and may not even have a cough or fever [80] . although severe covid-19 illness leading to hospitalization, including intensive care unit (icu) admission and death, can occur in adults of any age, 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of icu admissions, and 80% of deaths have occurred among adults aged ≥65 years [79] . likewise, long-term residential care facilities were particularly at risk for covid-19. in washington, a female resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility contracted covid-19. an epidemiologic investigation determined that 129 cases of covid-19 were associated with this facility, including 81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors. the majority of covid-19 cases were women (65.1%) and the median age was 81 years (range = 54-100 years) among facility residents, 42.5 years (range = 22-79 years) among staff members, and 62.5 years (range = 52-88 years) among visitors. out of the total 129 covid-19 cases associated with this nursing facility, 56.8% of residents, 35.7% of visitors, and 5.9% of staff members were hospitalized. ultimately, 23 persons (22 residents and 1 visitor) died as a result of covid-19 [81] . while it is believed that limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to the spread within and between facilities, the existence of underlying medical conditions has been found to be a very important risk factor. among these facility residents, the most common chronic underlying conditions were hypertension (69.1%), cardiac disease (56.8%), renal disease (43.2%), diabetes mellitus (37.0%), obesity (33.3%), and pulmonary disease (32.1%) [81] .by mid-march 2020, the entire united states, including four territories, had reported cases of covid-19. on 7 april 2020, nationwide case doubling time was approximately 6.5 days, yet, for areas such as louisiana the doubling time was 5.5. days [82] . moreover, during this time louisiana ranked 5th in the nation with approximately 16,200 confirmed cases and nearly 700 deaths, of which 70% were african american [77, 83] . the explosion of cases in new orleans has been anecdotally linked to the influx of travelers for mardi gras. yet, this theory does not explain the situation of shreveport, another louisiana hotspot for covid-19 cases [84] . initially race and ethnicity data were not reported for covid-19 cases, but then the covid-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network (covid-net) was created using the existing infrastructure of the influenza hospitalization surveillance network (flusurv-net) and the respiratory syncytial virus hospitalization surveillance network (rsv-net) in order to conduct population-based surveillance [85] . during the first month (1-30 march 2020) of surveillance in the united states, 1482 patients hospitalized with covid-19 were surveilled. among the covid-19 patients with underlying conditions data, 89.3% had one or more underlying medical conditions. the most common conditions were hypertension (49.7%), obesity (48.3%), chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular disease (27.8%) [85] . hence, the majority of persons hospitalized with covid-19 had underlying medical conditions. among patients with race and ethnicity data, 45.0% were white, 33.1% were african american, 8.1% were hispanic, 5.5% were asian, and 7.9% were of other or unknown race [85] . again, considering that african americans only comprise 13% of the united states population, the overrepresentation of african american covid-19 cases sheds light on issues that have often been overlooked.dr. frank m. snowden, a professor emeritus of history at yale university stated in an interview with the new yorker, that "[epidemics] reflect our relationships with the environment-the built environment that we create and the natural environment that responds" [86] . communicable diseases have existed in humankind since the days of hunting and gathering, but when the shift to a more agrarian life occurred thousands of years ago, the formation of communities by way of built environments created ideal conditions for epidemics. built environments, the man-made settings constructed and operated for the purpose of human activity, include the physical sites where humans live and work, and range in scale from homes in neighborhoods to buildings in cities. some evidence has shown that high occupant density built environments can encourage the transmission of airborne pathogens that can cause the common cold, influenza, chicken pox, whooping cough, tuberculosis and even covid-19 because of increased social interactions and direct contact between individuals [87] . open interior spaces where there is a high degree of spatial connectivity and more opportunity for social encounters can facilitate the spread of these pathogens as well as others [88] . therefore, the coronavirus pandemic has put a spotlight on the relationship between built environments, pathogenic infections, and public health.on march 15, 2020, the cdc recommended social distancing, also called physical distancing in modern society [79, 89, 90] . most states followed suit and issued stay-at-home orders with detailed directives such as "every person is ordered to stay at his or her place of residence except as necessary to perform essential activities" and essential activities included grocery shopping, obtaining medical prescriptions or service, providing care for others, or outdoor physical activity [91] . many states, including maryland and massachusetts, prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people and mandated that individuals stay at least six feet apart [91] . states throughout the country had ordered most businesses to close, banned all non-essential gatherings of any size and implemented telework policies when possible. for instance, in new york, only pharmacies, some retailers, hospitals, manufacturing plants, and financial institutions were allowed to open [92] . the closure of the schools, businesses, restaurants without a carry-out or delivery options, and leisure activities, including theaters and fitness facilities, have in essence created an abandonment of many built environment structures. many restaurants even with carry-out or delivery options have still needed to cut hours, switch to mobile payment systems and create new protocols of operation to face the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic [93] . some retailers, namely grocery stores, have implemented a daily senior shopping hour for this at-risk population and added six feet apart points at checkout lines to help customers maintain a physical distance [94, 95] . amid the coronavirus pandemic, companies have enabled work-from-home structures to keep businesses running and assist employees with social distancing compliance. nonetheless, working remotely has been a growing trend for a while and this pandemic essentially created millions of teleworkers overnight [96] . the public transportation infrastructure, another essential feature of built environments, has also been impacted by the severity of the coronavirus pandemic. in compliance with social distancing directives, many cities significantly reduced public transit service (e.g., subways, buses), thereby negatively affecting many individuals needing transit access. new york's metropolitan transit authority closed non-essential lines, concentrating resources to transit routes that supported essential personnel and those with urgent personal business [97] . new orleans regional transit authority has defined a set of essential destinations and eliminated routes that do not serve these locations [98] . the list of essential destinations included only healthcare facilities, pharmacies, and grocery stores. many agencies, like the chicago transit authority, have also imposed ad-hoc sanitation regimes to minimize the spread of the virus as well as the requirement of face masks for all riders [99] . the necessity of these preventative measures were underscored when a detroit city bus driver vented on social media his anger over a coughing bus rider and then subsequently died 11 days later from covid-19 [100] . in addition to a reduction of public transit in various municipalities throughout the united states, the service of commuter trains with amtrak was also disrupted throughout the coronavirus pandemic due to social distancing and shelter-in-place orders. on 16 march 2020, amtrak announced a 40% reduction, suspension or complete cancellation of various train lines throughout the northeast corridor of the country, including the amtrak hartford and winter park express lines [101] . amtrak has also required passengers to wear face masks [102] . furthermore, the department of homeland security (dhs) issued a notice of arrival restrictions in early march 2020 whereby all airline passengers arriving from china, iran, and certain european countries were required to travel through one of 13 airports where dhs had established enhanced entry screening capabilities [103] . by march 31, 2020 the department of state disseminated a "global level 4 health advisory-do not travel" and advised american citizens to avoid all international travel due to covid-19 [104] .airborne pathogens can be easily transmitted through indoor air and unfortunately indoor environments have not been designed to prevent the rapid dissemination of new diseases [105] . ventilation and the pattern of airflow controls the direction of droplet distribution generated from the respiratory activities of building occupants. thus, it is essential that environments with high occupant density and mobility, such as hospitals, schools, and offices, are designed to minimize the spread of airborne infections [105] . administrators and building operators have been searching for ways to promote good design and amenity of built environments. even before the coronavirus pandemic, new design and planning policies were trying to provide achievable guidance to environmental decision-makers, building operators and all indoor occupants in an attempt to minimize infectious disease transmission, particularly in dense urban environments [106] . consequently, the new sars-cov-2 virus has made a profound impact on planning, environmental laws, and urban infrastructures. according to the university of oregon's biology and the built environment center, stringent social distancing measures and building cleaning efforts needed to be put in place to reduce exposure to sars-cov-2 [88] . moreover, a more involved series of strategies, including changes to ventilation systems (e.g., increased outside air fractions to improve indoor air) and window operations (e.g., open windows to dilute indoor contaminants) have also emerged from the research center [88] . these modifications, as well as architectural techniques, combined with public health interventions can be used to efficiently disable diseases virulence and protect occupants in buildings from airborne pathogens [107, 108] .classifications and guidelines have shown that filtration as part of the ventilation system is a proven way to block the penetration of the outside pathogens into buildings [109, 110] . filtration can improve the indoor air quality and effectively reduce the pathogen loads released in the air [111, 112] . natural light and ultraviolet lights following proper protocols may also have the ability to inactivate sars-cov-2 [88] . studies have shown that some viruses are susceptible to ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (uvgi). factors, including humidity, airflow patterns, uvgi energy intensity and duration, have been able to impact uvgi effectiveness in inactivating pathogens [113] [114] [115] [116] . indoor humidity levels have also been discovered to be vital in the survivability of covid-19. a research team found that indoor humidity levels of 40-60% may help minimize the spread and survival of sars-cov-2 and with little risk of indoor mold growth [88] . while, most designs of air-conditioning systems have not supported central humidification, a targeted in-room humidification may be necessary during episodes of pathogen transmission risk [88] .the coronavirus pandemic has exposed weaknesses in the american healthcare system, specifically the consortium of hospitals. there are more than 6000 hospitals with approximately 920,000 beds in the united states, but even before the pandemic there were fewer doctors and fewer beds per capita than most other developed countries [117, 118] . according to data from the organization for economic cooperation and development, the united states has approximately 3 beds per 1000 people [117] . the higher rates of hospitalizations for chronic conditions that should not require hospitalization, including diabetes mellitus and asthma, has compounded the shortage of hospital beds during this pandemic. furthermore, hospital emergency departments in many areas, including rural communities, have not been well equipped for modern ailments or the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic [119] . designing guidance can aid healthcare facilities and clinics to cope with the increasing volume of covid-19 cases and create small scale segregation rooms [120] . the guidance for controlling covid-19 in healthcare settings indicated that patients should be isolated and placed in private rooms with a private bathroom. moreover, airborne infection isolation rooms should be used for patients who will be undergoing aerosol generating procedures, such as intubation or chest compressions [121] . to combat the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, a dutch architecture firm suggested a studio prototype "vital house", constructed quickly from sustainable prefabricated wooden materials. this "vital house", a temporary healthcare center could provide icus, communication, and a large green patio to enable faster patient recovery [122] . building pop-up triage tents immediately outside of hospitals has been a solution employed by medical centers throughout the unites states. a 14-tent, 68-bed hospital in new york city's central park and a 19-feet by 35-feet tent for 40 patients in durham, north carolina were constructed exclusively for covid-19 patients when the number of cases needing care exceeded the hospital capacity [123, 124] . these standing tents in empty spaces, under hospital overpasses and in proximity to emergency rooms have enabled healthcare workers to rapidly sequester crisis pandemic patients [125] .another environmental issue that may have amplified covid-19 transmission was the infection of healthcare workers who may have inadvertently spread the disease to patients. for example, covid-19 was found to have spread across four buildings of life care center, a consortium of skilled nursing facilities in washington [126, 127] . the course of events points to inadequate infection prevention and control measures in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. stated by the world health organization, sars-cov-2 can survive on surfaces for a few hours up to several days. for example, sars-cov-2 rna was identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the diamond princess cruise ship, but before disinfection procedures had been conducted [78] . reducing the number of flat surfaces where germs can sit has been deemed another way to keep pathogens and viruses from transferring between patients and healthcare workers around the building [125] . to control germs and bacteria on surfaces, designers have often avoided difficult-to-reach areas or tight corners in buildings and overly-complicated designs in high-touch surfaces [128] . according to markovitz, hospital designers have attempted to find smart materials and infrastructure that can easily be disinfected and washed [125] . also, certain materials already standardized in healthcare may find application in other public spaces, including antibacterial fabrics and finishes, non-porous materials that already exist (e.g., copper), as well as those that will inevitably be developed to facilitate cleaning and sanitizing [128] . moving forward, it will also be important for architectures to immediately remove the high-touch design features of buildings [125] . some large public spaces, such as airports, hotels, hospitals, gyms, and offices, have begun moving toward more automation to mitigate contagion. this coronavirus pandemic has revealed that using technology to remotely control the most-touched surfaces and developing touch-less technology (e.g., automatic doors; voice-activated elevators; cellphone-controlled hotel room entry; hands-free light switches and temperature controls) can significantly mitigate the spread of viruses [96] .much of the united states, with the exception of essential workers, has undergone nearly three months of social distancing in addition to shelter-in-place orders during the coronavirus pandemic. compared to others who are currently employed and working from home, essential workers must work outside the home. these workers, including healthcare workers, grocery store staff or transit operators, have been more likely to be african american and approximately 70% did not have a college degree [129] . furthermore, one in four essential workers have said that they or someone in their family is a healthcare worker, an employment classification that has been considered essential throughout the united states [129] . essential workers have been putting themselves at risk in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society through the country's shelter-in-place orders. in addition to this risk, many essential workers have also been designated as economically vulnerable. one in three essential workers reported living in a household that made less than $40,000 usd a year and one in seven lacked health insurance [129] . moreover, millions of essential workers rely on government assistance programs [130] [131] [132] . with a lack of options, many of these workers cannot afford to quit their jobs in spite of the heightened risk to sars-cov-2 exposure through their employment. a polarization has emerged among essential workers as a result of the inherent inequalities that persist within the united states. for example, there has been a clear economic and social distinction between a salaried pulmonologist who treats the respiratory system of covid-19 patients and an hourly waged grocery store cashier who processes and bags customer purchases, yet both are considered essential. aside from the difference in wages, the highly educated pulmonologist has been socially revered and showered with personal protective equipment campaigns while the grocery store cashier has been largely ignored, undervalued and unsupplied with simple face masks. it is clear that some essential positions require relatively few educational credentials or certifications and the skills necessary tend to be easy to learn and nontechnical. therefore, the pool of these particular workers is large, and it has been easy for employers to hire and fire these workers at-will.while simple economic concepts, such as supply and demand, can only partly account for the polarization of essential workers during the coronavirus pandemic, the norms of inequality within the united states contributes to the bulk of the circumstance. the jobs of essential workers have been more likely to be held by women, people of color, and immigrants. by the end of april 2019, the cdc reported that there were 4,913 essential workers diagnosed with covid-19 in 115 meat or poultry processing facilities throughout 19 states and that 20 people had died [133] . it was also disclosed that these processing employees communicated through language and cultural barriers, lived in crowded, multigenerational housing, and commuted to work together. likewise, workers were incentivized to work through illness thereby indicating a lack of appropriate healthcare options [133] . many essential workers have been poorly compensated because they were members of marginalized and underrepresented groups who generally have less political and economic capital compared to the white american male. in addition to poor compensation, 13% of essential workers lack health insurance and over 30% of these workers would have to borrow money to pay for an unexpected $500 usd medical bill [129] . within communities of color, many of whom are essential workers, as stated previously, covid-19 testing inequities have been observed. in several areas throughout the country there has been a lack of access to covid-19 walk-up testing as well as widespread testing [134] . in some observations, it has been reported that physicians may be less likely to refer african americans for covid-19 testing when they arrive with signs of infection [135] [136] [137] . reasons for this have included the dismissiveness of african american health complaints and the inequitable race-based or income-based hierarchy of patients [138] . pilot data have shown that, in comparison to white patients, african american patients with covid-19 symptoms were six times less likely to receive testing or treatment [138] . institutional and structural inequalities fueled by racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination have impeded the ability of people of color to secure employment with livable wages, healthcare access and insurance, and an opportunity for upward mobility. plus, given the societal expectation that these groups, and women in particular, provide service and care, this type of work has often been undervalued [139] . women of color stand at the intersection of multiple oppressive identities and experience the amalgamated effects of racial, ethnic, and gender biases. deep-rooted cultural attitudes and stereotypes about women of color have often devalued their work and deprioritized their needs [139] . this has been historically and contemporaneously shown through wage disparities. as an example, for every dollar earned by full-time, year-round working white men, hispanic women earn 54 cents and african american women earn 62 cents while white women earn 79 cents [139, 140] . the social distancing industry disruptions have greatly exacerbated the preexisting economic fragility of these women. as essential workers, many women of color have employment in healthcare or the service industry that places them on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic (table 1) [139, 141] . although an overwhelming percentage of these women work as housekeeping cleaners (60%), nursing assistants (50%), and personal care aids (46%), women of color also disproportionately work in several industries that have also been hit hardest by pandemic related job losses [139, 141] . women of color (and all women) comprise 24% (54%) and 30% (80%) of the accommodations/food services and healthcare/social assistance industries, respectively, the two hardest hit industries of unemployment as reported by the u.s. department of labor [139, 142] . the impact of social distancing is not just limited to economic and social inequalities; geographic disparities of covid-19 cases and mortality have been just as alarming. compared to other states, the first case of covid-19 was not reported in louisiana until march 9, 2020. yet, as of june 21, 2020 with more than 49,497 confirmed cases and 3104 deaths, louisiana ranked 7th in mortality rate (67 deaths per 100,000 people) [77, 83, 143] . these geographic variations do not necessary function exclusively as regional or spatial imbalances, but these variations are a manifestation of the residential segregation practices that have been and are still currently held in the united states [144] . overwhelmingly, at one point 70% of louisiana's covid-19 deaths were african american, despite this racial group comprising only 32% of the state's population [77, 83, 145, 146] . although african americans (54%) still maintain the highest percentage of covid-19 deaths in louisiana, the current racial breakdown of deaths are 44% (white (62% of louisiana population)), 2% (latinx (5% of louisiana population)), and 0.8% (asian (1.6% of louisiana population)) [147] . since the majority of deaths in louisiana are african americans, the intersection of race or racism with this covid-19 epidemiological trend seems to be a strongly suggestive hypothesis of inequality especially since similar trends have been identified throughout the united states, including illinois, michigan, north carolina, wisconsin and even in the nation's capital, washington, dc [148] [149] [150] [151] . while the exact cause for this racial disproportionality in covid-19 cases and mortality has yet to be uncovered, the effect of underlying racial health disparities, namely kidney disease, asthma, diabetes mellitus and obesity, that are also risk factors for covid-19, needs to be closely examined [152] [153] [154] [155] . the notion that economic and social disparities create and perpetuate health disparities cannot be ignored. as discussed previously, institutional and structural inequalities have played a significant role in the social determinants of health, or the conditions of birth, growth, living, learning, working, playing and aging, for african americans. for example, several african americans as well as other communities of color tend to live in food, transit or recreational deserts, more polluted and densely impoverished areas, and have been raising children in single-parent households [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] . these social determinants of health have contributed to poorer covid-19 outcomes. additionally, many african americans reside in areas where people have been unable to effectively social distance, such as prisons and homeless shelters [162] . finally, systemic racism as a barrier to healthcare treatment for african americans was present well before the coronavirus pandemic. research has shown that african americans rate health-related information they receive from family members and churches more highly due to an overarching sense of medical establishment distrust stemming from historical injustices (e.g., tuskegee syphilis experiment) among this population [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] . unfortunately, this has impeded access to medical care and magnified existing health disparities.the coronavirus pandemic has also endangered communities of color through other very recognizable routes of discrimination. in early april 2020 the cdc took at 180 degree turn and instructed the use of "cloth face coverings", such as bandanas, without considering the implications of gang affiliation, violence or racial profiling [168, 169] . this created a sense of anxiety among communities of color, which was not unfounded. specifically, african american men have been racially profiled when wearing surgical masks in an effort to reduce their covid-19 risk, or have expressed a level of psychological distress due to the fear of being racially profiled [170, 171] . a released video showed two african american men with facemask being followed in a walmart store by a police officer in wood river, illinois. although this incident occurred in march 2020, prior to the cdc face covering recommendation, all individuals throughout the country were well within their rights to use self-protecting efforts to reduce their covid-19 risk. african americans have not been the only targeted community of color. there has been an increase of anti-asian discrimination because of the origination of covid-19 in wuhan, china [172] . the federal bureau of investigation reported that asian americans were experiencing increased hate crimes due to the coronavirus global outbreak [173] . in midland, texas, three asian american family members, including a 2-year-old baby and 6-year-old child, were stabbed at a sam's club store and the suspect indicated that he attacked the family because he thought the family was chinese, and infecting people with the coronavirus [174] . also, in new york city teenagers attacked a 51-year-old woman on a city bus, spewed "anti-asian statements", and accused her of causing the coronavirus while another 13-year-old allegedly kicked a 59-year-old man for the same racist motives in a separate incident [174] . even in the midst of these remarkable times, hatred and bigotry have continued to reign in the united states.reflecting and reimagining a new post pandemic normal "epidemics are a category of disease that seem to hold up the mirror to human beings as to who we really are. that is to say, they obviously have everything to do with our relationship to our mortality, to death, to our lives. they show the moral relationships that we have toward each other as people, and we're seeing that today" [86] . while there are distinct similarities and differences when comparing the 1918 and 2019 pandemics, the historical accounts of the influenza pandemic and the current coronavirus pandemic have demonstrate that poverty, inequality, and social determinants of health create and support the conditions for disease transmission and the exacerbation of existing health conditions and disparities (table 2 ) [175] . interestingly, the public health response to both pandemics, albeit tempered by varying levels of political resistance, impacted human behavior through mandated social distancing or the use of face masks. however, unlike the influenza pandemic, widespread daily protests and demonstrations within at least 140 american cities and throughout the world completely eclipsed and overshadowed public health orders for social distancing and public gathering prohibition during the coronavirus pandemic [176, 177] . these protests rallied against the systemic police brutality of african americans, specifically the killing of george floyd by minneapolis police, and in support of the black lives matter movement [176, 177] . this unique moment in history has illustrated the convergence of two public health crises ((1) coronavirus pandemic; (2) african american genocide), both of which are impacted by the annihilation of institutional, structural, systematic and systemic racism within the united states. as a new normal for post covid-19 is reimagined the fundamental dynamics and entrenched ideologies of "acceptable living" and "equality for all" need to be addressed and strongly reexamined in order for the country to move forward. social distancing and shelter-in-place orders have been in place throughout the country since approximately the middle of march 2020. this has bought the country some time to curb the spread of the virus, limit the number of covid-19 cases and deaths, reduce the healthcare system strain, and allow a reflection for the preparation of the next phase [178] . following the pandemic containment and mitigation phases, the third suppression phase, which allows for a slow emergence from the quarantine status, requires essential elements in order to prevent an ascent of covid-19 infections [178] . the elements include measurable benchmarks with surveilling epidemiological trends (e.g., decline in covid-19 deaths for 14 days), fortifying the healthcare system (e.g., sufficient personal protective equipment for all healthcare workers) and transforming public health infrastructure (e.g., demonstrated ability to convey social distancing recommendations that change behavior in most residents) [178, 179] . once these elements have been implemented, aspects of social distancing can be relaxed. yet, the old normal of living still cannot return and most likely will not return. during the initial reopening of establishments, gatherings should still be capped at 10 people and restaurants will need to adopt social distancing seating to welcome patrons. however, it is recommended by governmental and public health officials that individuals over 60 years of age and those who are medically vulnerable continue to shelter-in-place until the final phase of reopening [180] . a staggered or partial reopening approach with new environmental safeguards, such as temperature and ventilation checks and mandatory handwashing/sanitizing at every entry and periodically throughout the day may be used for schools and businesses [179] . there also may need to be a quarantine of travelers from high prevalence covid-19 areas. governmental regulations may institute proof of immunity documentation or spending fourteen days in isolation before entering a new country for travelers. beyond a successful initial reopening and after at least four weeks of no significant increase in new covid-19 cases, the six feet social distancing measure may be paused, but there should still be a ban on gatherings which exceed 50 people until four months after the initial reopening [179] . throughout these phase transitions, it is critical for all public health leaders, political administrators, and the overall general public to work together in order to control, mitigate and eradicate covid-19. as stated by secretary-general antónio guterres of the united nations, the coronavirus pandemic is a public health emergency that became an economic, social and human rights crisis. specifically, by working together and "respecting human rights in this time of crisis more effective and inclusive solutions for the emergency of today and the recovery for tomorrow" can be achieved [181] .even with a new kind of normalcy, everyone may still practice consistent and better hygiene with handwashing, coughing, and sneezing, and greet and interact with each other differently [178] . people may need to create new ways of meeting with friends and colleagues. impressively, within the past couple of decades, the sharing economy has expanded and created environments with new components of how multiple people share the same spaces. these shared spaces, including co-work environments (e.g., wework), rooms in homes (e.g., airbnb), cars (e.g., uber), bikes (e.g., capital bikeshare), and other elements of the built environment, which can increase the potential and opportunities for environmentally mediated pathways of pathogen exposure, will need to be reexamined [182] . the coronavirus pandemic also may accelerate the development of risk-mitigating efforts designed to reduce human-to-human interactions, upgrade building ventilation and physical barriers, and adopt automation technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence vision systems [183] . given the severity of the pandemic and in compliance with social distancing directives, many american cities significantly reduced public transit service as mentioned previously. while agencies, like the chicago transit authority, implemented sanitation regimes to minimize the spread of the covid-19, many transit agencies may move to a new standard where face masks will always be required once anyone boards a train or bus [99] . while social distancing measures prompted organizations to embrace videoconferencing, virtual classrooms and telemedicine, these types of interactions may become more of the norm moving forward. with the fear of contagion, companies have shifted their protocols of operation. prior to the coronavirus pandemic, many businesses were already abandoning cash payments and in the wake of the outbreak, many more may permanently switch to digital only payments.structural building modifications (e.g., voice-activated elevators) or environmental adjustments (e.g., telework capabilities) may be a much easier acclimatization for many americans in the wake of a post covid-19 existence. yet, changing perceptions, attitudes and behaviors that have been deeply entrenched in the american way of living will be a much more challenging hill to climb. issues surrounding injustices related to many social determinants of health are not new and this pandemic has just illuminated these issues. the overwhelmingly disproportion covid-19 mortality rates of african americans only highlights the need to address longstanding inequalities. racism in the united states has created inequality in access to healthcare, housing, wealth, education, and employment, all of which are social determinants of health that can either promote or undermine one's health and longevity. in order to move forward, racism needs to be addressed and there needs to be new and tailored approaches to reach those who have been disadvantaged as well as the circumstances that have been generated through racist ideologies, practices and politices. for instance, when louisiana initially launched drive-through testing, an african american 90-year-old woman walked a mile in the heat to get tested [184] . this demonstrated that this covid-19 testing site was not accessible to many individuals who do not have cars or who live in transit deserts or who cannot afford private transit. upon learning this, public health officials targeted zip codes with the highest rates of covid-19 reported deaths and deployed testing in those areas. population-based testing and contact tracing during this pandemic has been vital in order to predict where to allocate resources, control the spread of the virus and implement evidence-based interventions to high-risk areas. however, evidence-based interventions are only achievable when there are accurate data and evidence. it was not until early april 2020, that the cdc began including race and ethnicity data in its morbidity and mortality weekly report [85] . many states have yet to release demographic data on deaths. while sars-cov-2 may be exploiting inequalities in the united states, this virus, similar to past as well as future pathogens, does not discriminate by race or any other social construct that man has created. if covid-19 is not contained in the most vulnerable populations, it will continue to spread to all communities and alter the future of human existence."this pesky flu's all over town! and white and black and rich and poor are all included in its tour." [185] author unknown prose poem on the 1918 influenza pandemicfor thousands of years disease outbreaks have devastated societies and the 2019 coronavirus pandemic is no different. as densely populated and urban environmental conditions shaped the 1918 influenza pandemic, the experience of the current day coronavirus pandemic is quite similar. while the influenza and coronavirus pandemics occurred nearly a century apart, there is one similarity of these events that is undeniable; the public health response to disease outbreaks has remained virtually unchanged with social distancing and face covering efforts. unfortunately, the role of human behaviors and social ideologies stemmed from the darker side of humanity on the effect and response to the coronavirus pandemic has also not progressed considerably. this review has revealed how the american burden of inequalities and injustices, as related to environments and human behavior, significantly impacts morbidity and mortality rates among the most vulnerable communities. as observed with the 1918 influenza pandemic, the present-day coronavirus pandemic has revealed and exposed the many inequalities that inhabit the united states. however, an opportunity has been presented which can allow for improvements, advancements, and an overall social uplift of our society. an epidemic of extreme respiratory deterrence, pneumonia and shortness of breath, the sars-cov-2 viral infection began in wuhan, hubei province, china in december 2019, and rapidly spread across china and beyond, with human to human transmission on february 12, 2020, world health organization officially named the new coronavirus disease as coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) most covid-19 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and many were treated using chinese medicines and other secondary therapies as of april 22, 2020, the total figure of infected patients has crossed 2 6 million people worldwide with over 180,000 deaths and 700,000 patients that have recovered preliminary reports suggest that certain drugs, such as chloroquine and antiviral nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, which inhibit viral replication, can target the new coronavirus, although their usefulness in the clinic is still under debate an expert us committee developed the us nih guidelines for covid-19 treatment, which was just released and will be regularly updated this manuscript reviews the epidemiology, etiology, mortality, covid-19 clinical symptoms, and potential therapeutic drugs, while highlighting the seriousness and damage-induced by sars-cov-2covid-19: review of epidemiology and potential treatments against 2019 novel coronavirusin december 2019, wuhan in the hubei province of china announced an active epidemic of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus, identified as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) 1,2 . over the next few weeks, infections spread throughout china and elsewhere in the world 3, 4 . chinese media, clinical and science institutions have reacted swiftly, such that the latest virus is identified and the viral genome sequence is shared quickly worldwide 2 . on january 30, 2020 the world health organization (who) announced an outbreak of public health emergency of international concern (pheic) 5 .on february 12, 2020, who named the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by the novel coronavirus 5 . a consortium of foreign experts collaborating with chinese colleagues of various specializations has sought to hold on this outbreak 6 . the first infected cases were associated with a food market in wuhan 1 . coronaviruses have enveloped, positive sense single-stranded rna genome, infecting humans and a wide range of animals. they were for the first time characterized and cultured by tyrell and bynoe in 1966, from patients with flu and common cold 7 . they were known as coronaviruses, based on their morphology as spherical virions with a central shell and surface projections identical to a solar corona (latin: corona means crown) 8 . there are four separate subfamilies, the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. alpha and beta coronaviruses appear to come from mammals, especially from bats, whereas gamma and delta coronaviruses derive from pigs and birds 9 . the genome length ranges from 26kb to 32kb. among the seven subtypes of coronavirus that may have the ability to infect humans the beta-coronavirus is considered the most dangerous; this is the one that causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans. sars-cov-2 virus belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus 9, 10 .the four main operational genes encodes for spike protein (s), nucleocapsid protein (n), membrane glycoprotein (m) and a small membrane protein (sm), with an additional membrane glycoprotein (he) occurring in the hcov-oc43 and hku1 beta-coronaviruses 9 . figure 1 presents the figure 1 : sars-cov structure (a, b) microscopic images at 5 micron indicate nc for nucleocapsid, s for spikes and e for envelope (c, d) two dimensional class averages data from a and b (e) spike attachment with outer capsid, (f) sars-cov with spikes red

and secondary analysis in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source". sars-cov-2 structure. the virus sequence is 96% similar with a bat-related coronavirus throughout the entire genome 10 . according to who, no specific medicine or antiviral was found to treat or prevent novel coronavirus until now 11 . it has been noted that chinese medication (cm), including oral administration of protective herbal formulae, the usage of cm sachets and herbal medicine fumigations, etc., is typically used to deter and manage novice coronavirus in china when the epidemic begins 11, 12 . chinese herbal and traditional medicines were also used in 2003 to combat sars, which was the most severe infectious disease epidemic in china before covid-19 11, 13 .preliminary studies show that this virus shares very high genome resemblance with 2002 bat-derived sars coronaviruses 14 . therefore, this virus was initially named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). coronavirus is a rna based enveloped entity named for its 9-12 nm long surface spikes for solar corona presence 15 . the coronaviral genome enclosed in the envelope bears four main structural proteins, including the spike protein (s), which binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor and then mediates a fusion between the envelope and the cell membranes in the host cell to the first reported patients happened in december 2019 15 . at the beginning, morbidity was very low. however, in january 2020 it hit a turning point. a significant rise in infected patients occurred in cities outside of hubei province during the second half of this month, due to the movement of people before the chinese lunar new year 22 . after an exponential rise until january 23, 2020 the infection traveled through countries and draws significant global interest. the occurrence of human-to-human infection was reported in the clusters of affected family members and medical staff 23 , by contact, droplets and fomite 10, 24 . so far, there is no proof of intrauterine infection documented 25 . who reported over 10,000 cases of covid-19 infections across china in late january 2020 15 the virus is believed to have incubation periods ranging between approximately 2-14 days (time from infection to symptoms) on the basis of the following sources:1. incubation time for covid-19 between 2 and 10 days has been recorded by the who 27 . 2. the chinese national health commission initially expected a 10 to 14 days incubation period 28 .(cdc) from united states of america assumes the incubation period of 2 to 14 days for covid-19 29 . 4. doctors and health-care practitioners, of leading chinese group dxy.cn predicts an incubation period of "3 to 7 days, and up to 14 days." in a report released on february 9, 2020, the incubation time was observed as long as 24 days (range from 0-24 days; average of 3 days) 30 . the who stated on february 10. 2020, at its press conference, that a very long duration of incubation can represent double exposure, 24 days was a specified point to be regarded in the sense of the study's key results 31 . nevertheless, more recently, in a jama report released on february 21, 2020, a 19day incubation period in infected patient has been identified 30 , hubei province registered another case infected patients between january 20 and 28, 2020. it was calculated that the mean incubation period was 6.4 days. the incubation duration varied from 2.1 to 11.1 days. the 11.1-day maximum limit may be known as conservative 28 . a comparison with other viruses can be found in table 2 .who director, general dr. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, said in his inaugural remarks at the covid-19 press briefing on march 3, 2020, that there is a 3.4% mortality rate globally. in comparison, seasonal influenza normally kills fewer than 1% of affected individuals 34 . initially, at a press conference on wednesday, january 29, 2020, and again on february 10, 2020, the who listed 2% as a mortality rate estimation. however, on january 29, 2020, who specified that this was a very early and provisional estimate, that might have changed 28 elderly patients with specific illnesses are considered at higher risk, regardless of whether they have a coronavirus or not 36 . patients with heart disease, high blood pressure or diabetes treated with ace2-increasing drugs may have a high risk for serious covid-19 infection 37 . a mortality rate comparison with other viruses is shown in table 3 , while the covid-19 fatality rate by age, sex and with comorbidity is shown in table 4, table 5 and table 6 , respectively.typically, covid-19 triggers flu-like symptoms, such as fever and cough. these symptoms can develop into pneumonia, chest strain, chest pain, and difficulty to breath in elderly people and other patients who have other chronic health conditions. it looks like it begins with a fever and leads to dry coughing. one week after infection the conditions become harsh and lead to breath shortening with approximately 20% of patients requiring hospital treatment and medication 29 . the covid-19 illness appears to seldom induce runny nose, sneezing or sore throat (only around 5% of patients have such symptoms). painful throat sneezing, and stuffy nose are typically symptoms of seasonal flu or cold 39, 40 . a few patients may develop pain or hemoptysis and many may also be completely asymptomatic 24, 41 . older people with comorbidity and serious alveolar injury are more prone to experience respiratory failure 42 . the onset of disease will demonstrate rapid progression to organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, shock, acute cardiac injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome ards) and death in severe cases 41 . sometime patients might develop lower or normal white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia or lymphopenia, with increased c-reactive protein level and extended activated thromboplastin time 24, 41, 42 . 80% of infected cases are found to be mild, with normal fever and flu and the patients can recover at home. in short, a patient having upper respiratory tract symptoms and fever with leukopenia or lymphopenia should be suspected (tables 7, 8, 9 ).to date, there are no proven effective antiviral therapies for the infection caused by sars-cov-2. treatment in several hospitals includes the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent secondary infection. initial reports have shown that some antivirals with antibiotics combination can be given orally with benefits 1 . on january 25, 2020 a joint research team from the shanghai institute of materia medica and shanghai tech university conducted a silicon drug screening and enzyme activity testing and reported 30 agents with significant antiviral activity against sars-cov-2 43 . the following are some drugs which have been used against covid-19 in-vitro. their use in the clinic is still under debate at this time.chloroquine, a commonly used anti-malarial and autoimmune medication, has recently been identified as a possible broad spectrum antiviral drug 44, 45 . in vitro, chloroquine is reported to be a variable bioactive agent that has antiviral activity against rna viruses, such as rabies virus 46 poliovirus 47 , hiv 48, 49 and hepatitis c virus 50 .chloroquine is known to prevent infection of the cells by the virus through increasing the endosomal ph needed for virus for cell fusion, and interfering with the glycosylation of sars-cov cell receptors 51 . the china national center for biotechnology development recently reported that chloroquine is one of the three drugs with a promising profile against the current sars-cov-2. chloroquine remodeling was explored in hospitals in beijing, in central china's hunan province and south china's guangdong province 52 . the drug that could potentially prevent sars-cov-2 infection at low molecular concentrations is chloroquine, with a halfmaximal effective concentration (ec50) of 1.13 μm and a half-cytotoxic concentration (cc50) greater than 100 μm 53 . however, in treating malaria, there are minor risks for adverse events, such as macular retinopathy and cardiomyopathy, whichare side effects caused by long term use of chloroquine [54] [55] [56] . evidently, chloroquine could be used for the treatment of covid-19 because of its effectiveness and safety for long term use 57 . a narrative letter by chinese authors reported that chloroquine phosphate used in many clinical trials has marked efficacy against covid-19. after oral administration, chloroquine is distributed widely across the body, including the lung. the ec90 value in vero e6 cells was 6.90 μm, that can be clinically attainable in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received 500 mg administration, which is demonstrated in their plasma 53 . hydroxychloroquine, which is a derivative of chloroquine, may have lower adverse effects than chloroquine 58 .administration of chloroquine against covid-19 is experimental. therefore, ethical trial approval is necessary, and ethically justifiable as the best treatment available (i.e. off-label). additional information on chloroquine's effects and usefulness for the treatment of covid-19 patients will soon be published due to its experimental use in the emerging outbreak. due to the high number of patients infected and the lack of approved drugs, timely release of this information may be critical. the who confirms that there is currently no evidence from randomized control trials to warn about specific covid-19 drug treatments and that unlicensed therapies can only be performed in the sense of ethically-approved clinical trials or under strict supervision of the controlled emergency use of unregistered procedures system (meuri). meanwhile, the recommendations for "clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) infection is suspected" 59 . the authors tend to agree with this viewpoint of who to view chloroquine as experimental. the outbreak is not the perfect environment for doing so, but even the use of chloroquine off-label can be followed by many concerns; the first being the health of patients, which should be followed by close supervision. the ethical approach to off-label drug use also varies from country to country, raising concerns regarding equity. off-label drug use could cause severe medication shortages when needed for malaria, since chloroquine remains a crucial medication in the treatment of malaria in many parts of the world 60 .for the use of chloroquine phosphate an expert consensus was published on february 20, 2020, by a multicenter collaboration group of the department of science and technology of guangdong province and health commission of guangdong province. preliminary measures recommended by the panel include blood tests to rule out the risk of anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia, as well as serum electrolyte abnormalities and/or hepatic and renal function dysfunctions. it is recommended to rule out the development of qt interval prolongation or bradycardia and to perform patient interviews to find out visual and/or mental disturbance. electrocardiography was routinely recommended and quinolones, macrolides, ondansetron as well as various antiarrhythmic, antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs which prolong the qt interval should be avoided as recommended by the panel 61 .remedsivir is an analogue of adenosine, which incorporates into nascent viral rna chains resulting in pre-mature termination. recently, it was recognized as a potential antiviral medication against a broad variety of rna viruses (including sars / mers-cov) in cultivated cells, mice and nonhuman primates (nhp) models [62] [63] [64] . the ec90 value of remdesivir in vero e6 cells against sars-cov-2 was 1.76 μm, indicating that its working concentration is likely to be attained in nhp models. the remdesivir has also effectively inhibited virus infection in a human cell line (huh-7 cells of human liver cancer) that is susceptible to sars-cov-2 65 . animal experiments showed that remdesivir can significantly reduce the viral load of mers-cov in the lung tissue of infected mice, enhance lung function and minimize pathological damage to the lung tissue 66 .on february 15, 2020, in china, favipiravir was approved for the treatment of the 2019 novel influenza. currently, this drug undergoes clinical trials to treat covid-19. favipiravir is an inhibitor of a new type of rna-dependent polymerase rna (rdrp) 67 . the value of favipiravir ec50 in vero e6 cells (cells used in the novel coronavirus study) was as high as 67 μm. although more in vivo research is required to test this antiviral nucleoside, it has also been shown to be 100% effective in protecting mice from the ebola virus 68 . preliminary results from a total of 80 patients (including the experimental group and the control group) have shown that favipiravir has a more potent antiviral effect than lopinavir / ritonavir 43 .convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies are suggested therapies for the treatment of covid-19 patients. convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins are used as a last resort to improve the survival rate of patients with sars, whose condition continued to deteriorate after pulsed methylprednisolone therapy 69 . in addition, some studies found a shorter hospital stay and lower mortality in patients treated with convalescent plasma 70 . further probability includes leronlimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody (ccr5 antagonist), and a nucleoside rna polymerase inhibitor galidesivir, both of which have shown survival benefits in many deadly virus infections and are considered potential useful candidates for treatment 71, 72 .lopinavir and ritonavir are both hiv protease inhibitors that suppress the cleavage of a polyprotein into multiple functional proteins. at the rajavithi hospital in thailand, the infectious disease team used a combination of oseltamivir (anti-influenza agent) and lopinavir/ritonavir to successfully improve the status of patients with severe conditions 73 .baricitinib, used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is an inhibitor of aak1 and janus kinase and is recommended to control viral replication 74 . machine learning models predicted that ap2associated protein kinase 1 (aak1) drugs that disrupt these proteins can inhibit viral entry into the target cells 75 . the use of baricitinib in susceptible covid-19-associated patients with ongoing pneumonia should be taken with strict caution 76 .clinical trials presently focus on the efficacy of different drugs, such as immunoglobulins, arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomization, ritonavir plus oseltamivir, asc09f plus oseltamivir, mesenchymal stem cell treatment, lopinavir plus ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, darunavir plus cobicistat, methylprednisolone and washed microbiota transplantation 65, 77 . repurposing these available drugs for immediate use in treatment of sars-cov-2 infections could improve the available clinical management 78 . study of xiaoling xu et al. suggests that tocilizumab is an important therapy in serious covid-19 patients, which offered a new therapeutic approach to this deadly infectious disease 79 .the virus sars-cov-2 is a fatal disease having a high mortality rate with a total of 2,200,358 certified cases and 147,787 deaths recorded all over the world. to date, there is no efficacious, proven medicinal therapy. a committee of us experts has developed treatment guidelines for covid-19 patients which are regularly updated 80 .a model drug, chloroquine, proposed by who could potentially work against the novel coronavirus. remdesvir, a nucleoside analogue, it also holds promise for the use in treating covid-19 patients. there are additional proposed drugs against covid-19, such as drugs approved by fda for the treatment of other pathologies, including ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine and two well-known drugs having broad spectrum activity i.e. remdesivir (gs5734) and favipiravir (t-705). leronlimab, a humanised monoclonal antibody (ccr5 antagonist) arbidol hydrochloride combined with interferon atomisation, lopinavir plus ritonavir, ritonavir plus oseltamivir, asc09f plus oseltamivir, mesenchymal stem cell treatment could also be a choice for the treatment of covid-19 patients. lopinavir and ritonavir are both hiv protease inhibitors that suppress the cleavage of a polyprotein into multiple functional proteins. based on historical records and human reports of sars and prevention of h1n1 influenza, chinese herbal formula may be an effective solution to covid-19 prevention in high-risk populations, although their usefulness in the clinic for this purpose still has to be demonstrated. in short, sars-cov-2 is a highly transmissible virus and clinical trials are required for finding and confirming promising drug candidates and effective vaccines.covid-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered novel coronavirus. this new virus and the caused disease were unknown before the outbreak began in wuhan, china, in december 2019. covid-19 is now a pandemic (who announced at march 12) affecting many countries globally [1] . covid-19 can appear with many symptoms such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgia (muscle ache), dyspnea(shortness of breath), expectoration (the coughing up and spitting out of material from the lungs, bronchi, and trachea, sputum), pharyngalgia, diarrhea (loose, watery stools),nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. respiratory system symptoms are more common, and onset of disease pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging [2] [16] . for the diagnosis, researchers define gold standard and lateral methods to overwhelm the pandemic via early diagnosis, but they have disadvantages such as high duration for rt-pcr (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), low sensitivity for antigen/antibody tests, high radiation exposure for computer tomography (ct). since these methods have many disadvantages, a rapid diagnosis pre-screening test is crucial to keep the population well-being. physicians' labor is the most important factor to fight with the novel coronavirus. in addition, decision support systems (dss) which are improved with the artificial intelligence (ai) and machine learning methods are timesaving activities for the physicians. a rapid analysis for the chest x-ray (cxr) scans, ct, infection rate or mortality rate with the machine learning methods are some of the helpful tools and researchers are trying to build such tools for pre-screening covid-19. this study defines a deployed environment 1 for rapid evaluation of the mortality rate and cxr scans via machine learning tools. the analysis explained in this study is the submitted work for the #euvsvirus hackathon 2 . the article goes as follows: sec. 2 discusses about the diagnosis methods and their disadvantages. sec. 3 reveals the algorithms in detail. sec. 4 is the evaluation of each algorithm deployed over the platform and sec. 5 concludes the work.rt-pcr is the gold standard to diagnose the covid-19 [3] but it is necessary to keep in mind that there are not enough studies to evaluate the accuracy and predictive values of the tests. sensitivity of testing depends on the precise of rt-pcr assay, type of specimen, duration of illness at testing. in a study at china, 1070 samples collected from 205 patients. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid had the most positive results 14 of 15 patients (93 percent). specimens from upper respiratory tract had fewer positive results. from 326 pharyngeal swabs there were 136 positive results (32 percent) and from 8 nasal swabs there were 5 positive results (63 percent). researchers in this study suggest that testing specimens from multiple sides may improve the sensitivity [4] . according to the statement and the study before it is necessary to do studies for evaluating rt-pcr tests.the second diagnostic tool defined in the literature is ct. according to a study in wuhan, china with 1014 patient's chest ct has 97 percent sensitivity based on positive rt-pcr results. researchers suggest that chest ct could be a primary tool to diagnose covid-19. unfortunately, specificity was 25 percent in other words 75 of 100 patients were false positive [5] . ct scan on pediatric patients should also be avoided due to radiation [6] . besides that, the problem is that resources to diagnose are not sufficient. in the literature, machine learning methods are also applied for the diagnosis through ct images [18] [19] and they are used for supporting the clinician's decisions. however, they can not be applied in large number of samples to exploit the speed of ai interpretation. therefore, lateral and rapid diagnostic tools are required for pre-elimination steps.according to the statement before pneumonia is the most common clinical manifestation and has fatal outcomes. that is the inspiration of solution. in order to diagnose the pneumonia, cxr appears to be a useful tool and to diagnose the community acquired pneumonia. in fact, it is a gold standard with clinical evaluation and microbiologic test results [7] . unfortunately, for covid-19 cxr has some limitations. in a study on 64 patients some patients had no abnormality in their cxr even they had positive initial rt-pcr. cxr may be normal in early or mild disease [8] , but this test can be used more frequently due to low radiation exposure. the health systems of the governments also have enough x-ray scan devices to satisfy the population. in spite of that cxr is a low-cost diagnostic tool and in healthcare chest x-rays are used frequently and we should keep in mind that that study has limitations as researchers stated. that inspires second part of our solution. some researchers also publish their ai architectures according to the detection of covid-19 patients [20] [21] . by evaluating the fact that cxr is not enough to speak about certain diagnosis, a supporting parameter can be provided to the physician for the conditions where ai can not catch the condition. in this study, this parameter is defined as mortality rate that shows the risk of mortality for the person who is infected with covid-19 disease.there are people who are at higher risk for severe illness. those at high-risk from covid-19 are people 65 years and older, people who live in nursing home or long-term care facility. also people of all ages with underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, including, people with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, serious heart conditions, immunocompromised (many conditions can cause a person to be immunocompromised, including cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled hiv or aids, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications), people with severe obesity (body mass index [bmi] of 40 or higher), diabetes ,chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis, liver disease [9] . there should be a risk evaluation parameter to direct these patients to other diagnostic services and identify these patients who are at the risk.3 proposed solution for pre-screening covid-19 3 mantiscovid is the hybrid platform proposed via this study. the evaluation platform has two outputs after screening the group of patients as the prediction about the risk in covid-19 via cxr and the mortality rate. two parameters can be used as a decision support system to direct the patient for the other highly sensitive tests. in the case where 1 mantiscovid :

patient via ai elimination from cxr, the physician can change approaching style to the patient via evaluating the mortality rate. if the patient has no symptoms and negative test results but have a higher mortality rate in that population, it is advised that follow up the patient closely but that advise should be evaluated by clinicians. although forecasting of mortality rate is not easy due to dependence over many conditions, we have tried to estimate the mathematical model as linear regression in terms of 7 parameters via using the open datasets over the patients [10] . the system works over the cloud as a web page and each physician can access to the system for the available computations. the system is designed to be scattered over millions of people to provide scalability via cloud. flow diagram of the platform is seen from fig. 1 . the system has two types of forecasting such as the mortality rate and cxr posteroanterior (pa) chest view via ai elimination. these methods used to implement the processing flow of forecasting the mortality rate is given in the following details. during the development, open source datasets are used and the python code for data synthesis and grouping from these sets is given 3 .the dataset used to compute the mortality rate is from open source covid-19 survival calculator. the mortality rate from dataset were modeled as a linear regression method by connecting it to 7 parameters [10] . the chosen mortality rate factors were age, sex, height, weight, health conditions (asthma, carcinoma, chronic kidney disease compromised immune system, coronary heart disease chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes, hiv positive, hypertension (high blood pressure), other chronic illness), blood type and smoking type. we have discarded some of mortality rate adjustment parameters to obtain a minimum dataset. the methods used to obtain the linear regression model for the mortality rate are the open source libraries associated with the python scikit-learn [15] .in the presentation of the cxr pa patient elimination ai platform, three types of ai algorithms are available to check whether the person is risky or not. the flow diagram can be seen from the fig. 2 . the sequence has a direct role to detect the risk from x-ray scans. as an aim, this hybrid module is not used for certain diagnosis due to low sensitivity occurring via pa chest view. it is only used as a decision support system for the clinician.the first model is generated to classify whether the input image is x-ray image or not. the model is trained via a dataset containing cxr pa scans with 211 images and images with 210 images [12] [13] . dataset is divided into training (70 percent) and test (30 percent) sets. if an image is detected as besides of x-ray image, the other algorithms are not processed, and it warns the user to check the uploaded image.keras library is used to generate the convolutional neural network (cnn) architecture for the starting point of the classifier [17] . in the input layer, 32 convolutional filters with size 3x3 are inserted with rectified linear unit (relu) activation function. inputs are accepted as 200x200 with red-green-blue (rgb) colors which makes input shape 200x200x3. max pooling layers and 2 hidden layers are inserted with 3x3 filter after convolution. each hidden layer contains 32 convolutional filters with size 3x3 relu activation functions with the addition of max-pooling layer with 2x2 filters. then, flatten operation is applied. fully connected layer is added with 64 units with relu activation function. later, dropout technique is applied with the rate of 0.5 to avoid overfitting. finally, fully connected layer is used with a unit with sigmoid function (1, if the image is x-ray image; 0, otherwise). the classifier ai in the middle revealing whether the patient is risky (covid-19 / pneumonia) or not is the trained model (modified version of alexnet [11] ) according to the open datasets strengthened with the currently obtained covid-19 patients' day by day [12] . the dataset is split into train (0.7), test (0.2) and validation (0.1) to enable the platform for the evaluation. it totally contains 8851 normal, 121 covid-19 and 9579 pneumonia patient data [13] . the ai architecture of the object classifier and training batch sizes are given in fig. 3 . the last part defined as the object detection case is the detection of the lung opacity parts associated with the bacteria type pneumonia. the ai neural network is the trained tiny version of you only look once (yolo) [14] to mark the single objects in cxr pa images. the anomaly is named as lung opacity. the dataset used in this part is the annotated cxr pa obtained through the open source datasets [13] .the system presented in this paper contains 4 different machine learning techniques to provide a rapid analysis of cxr pa view and the mortality rate evaluation. these algorithms are evaluated one by one with the allocated data. each evaluation results can be seen within the following details.1) linear regression model to forecast the mortality rate: this evaluation contains allocated 10000 patient data gathered from the open source dataset. the mean squared error and the standard deviation between the actual and predicted values are computed as 2.87 and 1.69 respectively. fig. 4 shows the details about the actual and predicted values via testing with 150 conditions.2) binary classifier to check whether uploaded image is x-ray scan or not: this evaluation contains additional 1000 x-ray and 1030 random images to be used in the evaluation of the binary classifier algorithm. the correctly predicted values for the x-ray scans and random samples are given as 971 and 943 separately. it is observed that the averaged accuracy is about 96 percent.3) classifier to separate covid-19/pneumonia/normal patients: this part contains randomly selected 150 patient data to be separated via the ai algorithm. the sensitivity of the risky patient detection (covid-19/pneumonia) is 84 percent. the sensitivity for the detection of normal patients is 67 percent. the confusion matrix can be seen in the following fig. 4 . as the main objective is the detection of risky patients in high accuracy, the system conditions can be improved via gathering more patient data which is known as covid-19 certainly.lesion detection over the bacteria type x-ray scans: this part contains randomly selected 30 patient data to be analyzed via the ai algorithm. the evaluation criterion is comparing the number of lesions between the real annotated and predicted x-ray scans. the allocated dataset is divided into three groups as 2 lesions (10 image), 1 lesion (10 image) and no lesion (10 image). the detected and the actual number of lesions over the groups are given as in the 4 . cc-by-nc 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who

would be useful for the elimination of non-risky patients in the coronavirus pandemic. since the algorithms are developed and evaluated using the open source data and platforms, this system needs to be evaluated via the clinical perspective by the legal authorities. this platform is an internet-based pre-diagnosis tool to be verified via the universities during the covid-19 diagnosis. however, a physician would also use this tool as an assistant to scan and diagnose the patients due to the rapid diagnosis requirement to prevent spreading of the coronavirus. in fact, the gold standards used to diagnose the covid-19 patients also have high false alarm rates because of the epidemiology of the disease is not fully known.as a future work, the clinical validation of the internet-based platform will start with the known legal authorities and other state of the art ai architectures will be used to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the platform. the integration over the platform will continue with the chest anteroposterior (ap) views, chest ct and ultrasound images by providing novel ai architectures. infection rate for the novel coronavirus would also be evaluated with the usage of tracking the patient's locations. after the coronavirus pandemic, this platform would also be used for scanning the society in terms of the mortality rate and x-ray scans in any other illnesses and symptoms. there should be more studies to identify case fatality rate and infection rate in the case where proper data will be collected to train ai.. cc-by-nc 4.0 international license it is made

(2020) china [57] overlapping publication impact of cardiovascular disease and cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19: a systematic review and meta-analysisin the past two decades, the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) in 2012 have taken severe death tolls worldwide, with 916 and 800 deaths, respectively. 1 in late 2019, another virus with lethal respiratory infection potential identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2) emerged and heralded another global pandemic. 2 since the outbreak in wuhan, more than 200 countries and regions have reported confirmed cases. the who coined covid-19 to describe 'coronavirus disease 2019' and declared this outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. 3 as of 24 april 2020, there have been nearly 2 750 000 infections and over 192 000 deaths worldwide.within less than 6 months, covid-19 has registered a mortality record that is higher than that of sars and mers combined. 4 5 because of the overwhelming fatality cases caused by covid-19, much concern has been raised to determine the risk factors for poor prognosis, such as advanced age and male sex. 3 6 previous research has reported that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease (cvd) were prone to viral infection and also had a greater risk of developing severe cases and being admitted to intensive care unit. 7 8 sars-cov-2 can attack the respiratory system by targeting ace2. however, with the high tissue-specificity of ace2 expression in the cardiovascular system, cardiomyocytes may be particularly prone to damage. 9 several studies have reported a high incidence of elevated cardiac troponin in hospitalised patients, especially in those in critical conditions. 10 11 thus, patients with cvd complications may have poor prognosis when infected with sars-cov-2. therefore, here we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the available evidence to evaluate the association between underlying cvd and incident cardiac injury with in-hospital mortality risk in patients with covid-19.this meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement 12 and the meta analysis of observational studies in epidemiology statement. 13a comprehensive search was performed in pubmed, embase and web of science databases from 1 january 2020 to 14 april 2020. the following search terms were included: 'coronavirus', 'covid-19', '2019-ncov', 'sars-cov-2', 'cardiovascular disease', 'coronary heart disease', 'hypertension', 'cardiac injury', 'myocardia injury', 'mortality', 'death' and 'fatality'. in addition, the reference lists of relevant articles were reviewed for potential studies.studies were included for the meta-analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) exposure factor: cvd (coronary heart disease, cardiac disease and healthcare delivery, economics and global health figure 1 preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow diagram of study selection. chronic cardiac disease), hypertension or acute cardiac injury;(2) outcome interest: in-hospital mortality; and (3) study population: adult patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection. to avoid duplication, we contacted the authors whose studies were conducted in the same hospital. if the same batch of patients were enrolled or no specific information identifying the patients could be provided, study with the largest sample size was included.two researchers (xl and bg) independently screened the search results by titles and abstracts. any potentially relevant studies were retrieved with full texts for further evaluation. two authors (xl and bg) independently identified the eligible studies based on inclusion criteria. any disagreements were resolved through discussion with another researcher (ts).two researchers (xl and bg) independently extracted data from the enrolled studies via a preset standardised form. the following information was extracted: first author, publication year, study design, location, patients enrolled period, age, sex, prevalence of comorbidities, exposure factors and level of adjustment. newcastle-ottawa scale terms, 14 with total score of nine stars, were applied to evaluate the quality of case series studies or cohort studies separately. the studies with 7 points or more were considered of high quality.all analyses were performed using stata v.12.0 software. the unadjusted ors with 95% cis were calculated as the common risk estimates and then were pooled due to the limited data on multivariable adjusted outcomes. the heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by cochran's q-statistic and i 2 test. if i 2 ≤50%, a fixed effects model was adopted; otherwise, a random effects model was applied to meta-analysis. meta-regression analysis was performed to test the potential sources of heterogeneity among studies. sensitivity analyses were also performed by omitting one study at a time to evaluate the influence of individual study on the pooled results. publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of asymmetry in funnel plots.patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, dissemination plans of our research. the initial database search yielded 1524 studies (figure 1). after removing duplicate publications, 825 studies were left and screened by title and abstract, and we identified 67 articles for full-text review. of these, 57 studies were excluded due to no relevant outcome, no exposure of interest, duplicated publication, not a primary study or medical intervention study (online supplementary file 1). no additional studies met the inclusion criteria from screening reference lists. when several studies were published by the same institution, the authors were contacted to ensure that no overlapping cohorts were analysed as separate studies. altogether, 10 studies comprising 3118 patients were included in this meta-analysis. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] the main characteristics of the included studies are summarised in table 1. of all 10 studies, two were case series design 15 16 and the remaining eight were cohort studies. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] all studies were conducted in wuhan, china, except for one study that enrolled patients nationwide. 17 the patients were all accrued from the end of december 2019 to february 2020. the mean age ranged from 49 years old 17 to 68 19 years old and the proportion of male patients ranged from 45% 22 to 67%. 21 the prevalence of cvd and hypertension ranged from 4% 17 to 15% 18 and from 17% 17 to 44%, 19 respectively, and from 15% 24 to 44% 15 of patients experienced cardiac injury during hospitalisation (table 2) . eight studies 15-17 19 21-24 reported the relationship between underlying cvd and in-hospital mortality risk (2515 patients and 127 deaths) in unadjusted model. five studies 15-17 23 24 consistently revealed a significantly higher death risk in the cvd group and the remaining three studies 19 21 22 reported no significant relationship between cvd and in-hospital mortality ( figure 2) . overall, the summary estimate demonstrated that patients with cvd had an approximately fivefold higher risk of mortality compared with non-cvd patients (unadjusted or 4.85, p<0.001; 95% ci 3.06 to 7.70). the heterogeneity across the studies was non-significant (i 2 =29.3%, p=0.194). seven studies 15-17 22-24 (2463 patients and 535 deaths) were included for the pre-existing hypertension and in-hospital mortality analysis with unadjusted ors. six studies 15-17 22-24 reported a significantly higher mortality risk in patients with previous hypertension, and the remaining study 19 showed no significant association (figure 3). the pooled unadjusted effect of hypertension on mortality risk was 3.67 (95% ci 2.31 to 5.83, p<0.001) with moderate heterogeneity (i 2 =57.4%, p=0.029).for cardiac injury, all eight studies 15 16 18-21 23 24 (1429 patients and 374 deaths) except one 21 reported that acute cardiac injury was significantly associated with a high mortality risk in unadjusted model ( figure 4) . the pooled effect of these studies (unadjusted or 21.15, 95% ci 10.19 to 43.94, p<0.001; heterogeneity: i 2 =70.5%, p=0.001) showed that patients with elevated troponin levels had a significant higher mortality risk than those with normal troponin levels.visual inspection of the funnel plots did not show significant asymmetry (online supplementary file 2). sensitivity analyses were conducted by systematically excluding one study at a time, and the results remained consistent with the primary analyses (online supplementary file 3). to explore potential sources of heterogeneity, meta-regression was applied to test the influence of study design, sample size, mean age and male proportion. none of these factors contributed significantly to the observed heterogeneity (online supplementary file 4).our study evaluated the impact of underlying cvd, hypertension and acute cardiac injury on in-hospital mortality in patients with covid-19. our results showed a positive association between previous cvd and hypertension with fatal outcomes, with unadjusted ors and 95% cis of 4.85 (3.06 to 7.70) and 3.67 (2.31 to 5.83) and a significant relationship between acute cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality (unadjusted or 21.15, 95% ci 10.19 to 43.94).the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) is a single-strand rna virus that shares several similarities with sars-cov and mers-cov in genetic sequencing and clinical presentation but is equipped with a more robust capacity for human-to-human transmission. 25 26 from the outset, the capacity of 2019-ncov to spread and infect people in wuhan, china, was alarming, and the infection has rippled throughout the rest of the world, causing severe morbidity and mortality. 27 therefore, there is a pressing need to identify risk factors for poor prognosis among patients with covid-19.patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were found to be more vulnerable to coronavirus infection and may have poor prognoses. 4 previous meta-analyses systematically tested the relationship between cvd and severity of the disease but with nonuniform definitions of clinical outcome. 28 29 the meta-analysis by zuin et al 30 included three studies and reported a positive association between hypertension and mortality risk in patients with covid-19. our study reinforced their conclusion and found that patients with cvd history also had an almost fivefold higher risk of mortality comparing with non-cvd patients. however, since our results were obtained using unadjusted ors, the exact role of cvd in the risk stratification of patients withwhat is already known on this subject? ► previous studies showed that covid-19 patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease (cvd) were more likely to be admitted to intensive care unit, and in-hospital cardiac injury was commonly seen in critically ill patients. however, the relationship between cvd and cardiac injury with fatal outcomes has not been fully elucidated.what might this study add? ► in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that in-hospital morality risk was significantly higher in covid-19 patients with underlying cvd or hypertension, and patients with acute cardiac injury had a worse prognosis.how might this impact on clinical practice? ► among patients with covid-19, those with established cardiovascular comorbidities and acute myocardial injury should be recognised earlier, and more aggressive treatment may be warranted. elevated troponin may be considered as an important predictor for mortality risk.covid-19 is still undetermined. there may be several mechanisms that account for the high mortality risk of covid-19 patients with cvd history. first, patients with underlying cvd are more likely to decline into an unstable haemodynamic status when infected with 2019-ncov. 31 severe pneumonia places a considerable workload on cardiac ventricles, which may exacerbate pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, even causing cardiogenic shock. 4 second, inflammatory reactions caused by 2019-ncov infection might convert chronic coronary artery disease into acute coronary syndrome. 32 33 a profound systemic inflammation wave along with local inflammatory infiltration may lead to a hypercoagulative state and atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which may culminate in thrombotic events. 23 third, the priority of treatments, in favour of limiting nosocomial viral transmission while neglecting other medical issues, might predispose cvd patients to unfavourable clinical outcomes. the current interim guidelines suggest that patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infarction should consider thrombolysis first in the covid-19 era. 34 severe adverse effects such as cerebral haemorrhage and insufficient and undesignated coronary revascularisation caused by thrombolysis can increase the risk of death. acute cardiac injury is commonly recorded in patients with covid-19. 35 the incidence of cardiac injury among our enrolled studies ranged from 15% to 44%, which was higher than the prevalence of cvd (5%-15%). this suggested that 2019-ncov might attack cardiomyocytes through different pathways, other than exacerbating the already compromised cardiovascular system. 2019-ncov infection may lead to cardiac injury secondary to conditions causing oxygen supplement insufficiency, such as severe pneumonia, anaemia, hypotension and bradycardia. furthermore, by attacking myocardium via the highly expressed ace2 directly, 2019-ncov precipitated the release of cytokine and chemokine waves and caused myocardial inflammation, even leading to fulminant myocarditis in severe cases. 31 36 meanwhile, our results complied with guo et al, 18 who reported that the death risk of cardiac injury was much higher than that of pre-existing cvd. their study revealed that patients with copresence of cvd and cardiac injury registered the highest mortality rate of 69.4%, while those with only underlying cvd had a relatively favourable prognosis (mortality rate of 13.3%). furthermore, elevated troponin was reported to be associated with a high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, hepatic dysfunction and acute renal injury in patients with covid-19. 18 37 the study by shi et al 20 demonstrated that elevated troponin was an independent risk factor for death after adjusting other confounders. 20 thus, this index may be considered as a biomarker to predict the mortality risk of patients with covid-19. more studies are warranted to confirm this finding and provide probable suggestions on the risk stratification of patients with covid-19.to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association of underlying cvd and acute cardiac injury with mortality risk in patients with covid-19. this meta-analysis may provide insights into the prognosis stratification of patients with covid-19. however, there are some important limitations that should be mentioned. first, our meta-analysis was conducted on unadjusted ors due to the limited data on multivariableadjusted outcomes. the observed association of cvd and cardiac injury with mortality might be confounded by other risk factors, such as advanced age, and cofounder adjustment may distort our meta-analysis results towards a less significant risk. thus, large cohort studies with multivariate analysis are needed to provide more evidence on this issue. second, our study could not determine the causal effects of cardiovascular comorbidities on mortality due to the inherent limitations of observational studies. future studies aiming to investigate this causal association are warranted. third, the heterogeneity among studies for cardiac injury was significantly high, which may be caused by the study design and patient inclusion criteria. however, the metaregression exploring the potential sources did not find significant results, and the results remained consistent in sensitivity analyses. finally, most of the studies enrolled were conducted in wuhan, china. therefore, these results should be treated with caution when extrapolated to other populations. since wuhan was the initial epicentre of the outbreak, these early evidence may provide clinical implications and insights for researchers and clinicians in other parts of the world.covid-19 patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities, including cvd and hypertension, may face a greater risk of fatal outcomes. acute cardiac injury may act as a marker of in-hospital mortality risk. given the unadjusted results of our meta-analysis, future well-designed studies with multivariate analysis are warranted to confirm these findings.the coronavirus disease ,caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), emerged in december 2019 and has rapidly spread worldwide. [1] globally, the onslaught of the covid-19 outbreak on the public health system continues despite unprecedented mobilization. the mortality of critical ill patients with covid-19 has been reported variously as low as 11% and as high as 61%. [2] [3] [4] [5] bhatraju et al. [5] reported that the ratio of patients with covid-19 over 65 years of age had died greater than patients less than 65 years of age. in a 43 patients' study, saurabh aggarwal et al. reported three patients aged 70 years or older died. [6] in critically ill covid-19 patients, early medical intervention to reduce mortality depended on early effective assessment.[7]the application of scoring systems can facilitate effective evaluation by emergency or critical care physicians to screen severe patients. at present, however, there are no specific scoring systems for the evaluation of covid-19 patients. another option is to adopt existing scoring systems that are used for predicting the mortality of severe patients.scoring systems, such as the sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) and the more recent quick sequential organ failure assessment (qsofa), can help emergency or critical care physicians for prognosis and predicting mortality . the sofa scoring system was developed in 1996 by an international group of experts [8] .sofa describes the condition of multiple organ dysfunction through several parameters, including the oxygenation index (arterial oxygen tension [pao 2 ]/fraction of inspiration oxygen [fio 2 ]), mean arterial pressure, glasgow coma scale(gcs), creatinine or urine j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f several studies revealed that the sofa score could predict morbidity and mortality and this specific application has been validated in severely ill patients [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .therefore, it is of interest to determine whether the sofa score could predict mortality in the covid-19 population.the qsofa score was introduced in the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3) and is composed of three clinical parameters: systolic blood pressure≤100 mmhg, respiratory rate≥22 breaths/minute, and altered mental status. the qsofa score was created initially for the evaluation of septic patients, but several recent studies have described its effectiveness for predicting mortality in patients with different diseases [14] [15] .both sofa and qsofa have widespread application to screen patients with life-threatening conditions in the emergency or critical care department [16] . several studies [17] [18] [19] have suggested that the sofa and qsofa were high-performance assessments to evaluate the risk of mortality in critically ill patients. these scoring systems can assist emergency or critical care physicians to predict mortality of such patients, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.the covid-19 epidemic is a scenario of shortage of medical resources. however, to our knowledge, no study has validated the performance of sofa and qsofa for severely/critically ill covid-19 patients.this study was conducted with an aim to evaluate the prognostic value of sofa and qsofa models with regard to the in-hospital mortality of covid-19 patients.j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f managed by an emergency medical team that was deployed to wuhan. the team independently managed the covid-19 ward in a local hospital that was temporarily constructed for covid-19 patients and comprised 80 beds.the diagnosis and treatment plan of novel coronavirus, [20] issued by the national health commission of china, was adopted as a criterion for the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of covid patients in the covid-19 ward.we searched for all adult patients (age >18 years) who had been diagnosed with severe/critical covid-19 and admitted to the ward between january 31, 2020 and march 7, 2020 through the computerized registration system of the ward. the criterion of severe/critical covid-19 is followed the diagnosis and treatment plan of novel coronavirus, which can be download in http://www.nhc.gov.cn (table 1) [20]. we identified 140 records that were eligible for study inclusion.then, all the cases was divided into sub-group of young (age <65 years) and senior (age ≥65years) for analysis. this study was conducted with the approval of the local institutional review board and was undertaken in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki for research on human participants.[insert table 1 here] the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis was applied for a discriminatory evaluation of the performance of the sofa and qsofa scores. the classification performance of both scoring systems to discriminate between survivors and non-survivor was evaluated by calculating the area under the curve (auc) of the roc and its 95% confidence intervals (95%ci). we conducted the delong test [21] for a comparison of the aucs of sofa and qsofa.for each rapid scoring system, the score with the largest youden index was defined as the optimal cutoff value for predicting covid-19 mortality. based on the optimal cutoff value, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), and negative predictive value (npv) for both scoring systems. a p-value<0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.data were entered into the ibm statistical product and service solutions (spss) version 20.0 for j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f windows and were analyzed by medcalc ® 12.7.we initially included 140 severely or critically ill patients who were admitted to the covid-19 ward.however, the final analysis dataset included 127 patients, after excluding 13 patients with missing data ( figure 1 ). in total, the mean age of the patients in this study population was 61.25 (sd ±15.53) years, and 75 patients (70.09%)were male. the baseline characteristics and comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, cerebral vascular disease, and malignant tumor, of the survivors and non-survivors in this study sample are listed in table 2 .[insert table 2 here][insert figure1 here]from among the 140 cases that were initially identified, we excluded 13 cases because of missing data. the final analysis dataset included 127 cases.variables that showed significant differences between the survivors and non-survivors included age, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, the roc curves of sofa and qsofa scoring systems for predicting in-hospital mortality are depicted in part a of figure 2 , and their aucs were0.915 (95% ci: 0.852-0.957) and 0.742 (95% ci: 0.657-0.816), respectively; there was significant difference between the two scoring systems(p=0.007; based on the largest youden index, an optimum cutoff value of 3 was used to predict in-hospital mortality by using the sofa score, with a sensitivity, specificity, ppv, and npv of 90.00%, 83.18%, j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 50.00%, and 97.80%, respectively. similarly, an optimum cutoff value of 1 was used to predict in-hospital mortality by using the qsofa score, with a sensitivity, specificity, ppv, and npv of 70.00%, 80.37%, 40.00%, and 93.48%,respectively ( table 4 ).the sensitivity and the specificity of sofa were considerably higher than those of qsofa.therefore, the sofa score can better predict mortality in critically ill covid-19patients than the qsofa score.[insert table 4 here] table 4 . sensitivities, specificities, and accuracy rates of sofa and qsofa for predictingfor verify importance of sofa as predictor in covid-19, we conduct univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. in univariable logistic analysis, the age, sofa and qsofa were predictors in covid-19(p<0.05); while in multivariable logistic regression analysis, only the age and sofa were predictors in covid-19. (table 5) [insert table 5 here] table 5 . univariate and multivariate logistic analysis for inpatient death of covid-19the roc of sofa and qsofa scores of subgroups in predicting in-hospital mortality is depicted in however, sofa is complex and time-consuming, because it needs six parameters and four of them are from laboratory results. while the superiorities of qsofa are simple, rapid and practical, but some studies suggests that qsofa has a low sensitive for in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with suspected infection [26] . in the absence of a specific risk-scoring system for covid-19, we studied the performance of the sofa and qsofain the evaluation of severely or critically ill patients in order to identify an effective risk-scoring system for covid-19 patients.to our knowledge, this is the first research to evaluate the performance of the sofa and qsofa in predicting the mortality risk of severely ill covid-19 patients. this retrospective study has investigated the performance of both sofa and qsofa scores as predictors of prognosis in severely or critically ill covid-19 patients. initially, we determined that a sofa score of ≥3 and a qsofa score of ≥1 were associated with mortality in severely ill covid-19 patients. furthermore, the study showed that the sofa score is a highly sensitive marker of in-hospital mortality in covid-19 patients and is prognostically superior to qsofa in this setting.in our analysis, the sofa illustrated acceptable predictive performance for in-hospital mortality on roc curve analysis in both overall and subgroup analysis. at the time of admission, a sofa score ≤3 was highly predictive of spontaneous survival in covid-19 patients. the high npv in overall analysis of97.80% for sofa functions as a gate keeper by accurately identifying low-risk patients. the greater predictive advantage of the sofa is attributable to the higher number of clinical parameters and inclusion of six important variables in the scoring system, which facilitated more accurate patient stratification. on univariate analysis, we found that five (mean arterial pressure, [27] that severely ill patients had a lower platelet count. in a meta-analysis conducted by lippi and colleagues, [28] low platelet counts were associated with increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19. zhang et al. [29] reported that a higher bilirubin level and lower oxygenation index were observed in severely or critically ill covid-19 patients; furthermore, higher serum creatinine levels at admission were a predictive factor of disease severity in their patients. the pathogenic mechanisms underlying changes in the abovementioned clinical indicators in covid-19 patients need to be further studied, although these indicators can be perceived, at the very least, as predictive factors of the mortality risk in critically ill patients. [30] the aucs of qsofa of both overall and subgroup analysis were lower than that of sofa; therefore, we considered the accuracy of sofa to be higher. the prerequisite parameters for sofa can be determined through medical assessment and laboratory examination. nevertheless, there is a need to recognize that, as qsofa is simple, fast, and acceptable accuracy, it can be used in the emergency room or at admission if the parameters of the sofa cannot be acquired in time.this novel study explored the effectiveness of the sofa and qsofa scoring systems for predicting mortality risk of severely or critically ill covid-19 patients and ascertained their practical value in identifying severely or critically ill covid-19 patients with a higher mortality risk. however, some limitations of this study need to be considered. this study is limited by the small sample size.studies with a larger number of severely or critically ill covid-19 patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria would enable amore effective evaluation of the sofa and qsofa scoring systems. this was a single-center study and may have been affected by a selection bias with regard to the study population.multicenter studies are required to prospectively validate the clinical utility of the sofa and qsofa scores in severely or critically ill covid-19 patients. moreover, the prognostic value of the scoring j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f systems among patient subgroups that were stratified by gender groups or underlying diseases was not analyzed owing to the limited sample size furthermore, because of the limited availability of information; details of out-of-hospital therapy and nursing care were not captured. finally, there are several risk-scoring tools, such as the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation scoring systems, that find widespread application in the critical care unit and emergency departments. however, in this retrospective study based on medical records, the information that could be collected could only permit a calculation of sofa and qsofa scores. future studies are needed to comparatively explore the performance of other scoring systems in the covid-19 patient population.the sofa scoring systems at admission have high classification performance in predicting the mortality risk of severely or critically ill covid-19 patients and have acceptable npv for screening these patients. the performance in predicting such patients of qsofa is accepted but inferior to that of sofa. journal pre-proof transmission of sars-cov-2 occurs primarily via the respiratory route whereby droplets containing the virus travel when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. it is unclear whether the virus also is transmitted via the aerosol route; that is, via smaller particles not requiring droplet transmission. 3, 4 early research found that most infected individuals suffer only minor symptoms. [5] [6] [7] conversely, older individuals, particularly those with coexisting morbidities (eg, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and/or obesity), are more likely to experience severe symptoms and to die. [8] [9] [10] other data, albeit largely anecdotal, indicate that the death toll from infection is disproportionately greater among minorities and among residents who live in inner cities and/or rural communities. 11 the greater vulnerability of these groups is believed to be due to a combination of poverty, a higher prevalence of comorbid diseases, and poor accessibility to health care. 12 in terms of the differences between urban and rural areas in exposure to covid-19, although the high population density in large cities and metropolitan areas is a major risk factor for contracting the virus, rural areas may be uniquely vulnerable due to the older age structure of many rural communities, the higher prevalence of chronic illnesses (eg, diabetes and hypertension), and a relative lack of health care facilities and services. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] since the outbreak of sars-cov-2 in the united states, geographic information systems (gis) have been used to quickly map the distribution and diffusion of the pandemic. [19] [20] [21] [22] however, to our knowledge, there has been little published analysis of geographic disparities in infections and deaths among urban, suburban, and rural communities. 23, 24 additionally, empirical data that explore the risk factors that are associated with sars-cov-2 infections and fatalities are needed in order to inform policies including preparation, response, mitigation, and recovery strategies. [25] [26] [27] this ecological analysis investigates spatial patterns of covid-19 relative to socioeconomic contexts of different types of communities across the united states using data for us counties and metropolitan areas.data on confirmed cases and deaths of covid-19 were compiled and released by the center for systems science and engineering (csse) at johns hopkins university, which compiled data collated by the us centers for disease control & prevention (cdc) from individual states and local health agencies. we used county-level data for 2,814 us counties that had at least one case of infection as of may 1 2020. the data for new york city includes its 5 boroughs (or counties): manhattan, bronx, kings, queens, and richmond, which were provided as a single unit in the original data set. numbers of cases and deaths for kansas city, missouri, and jackson county (home to kansas city) were reported separately in the original data but were consolidated as one county. we excluded cases that were assigned at the state level but were not affiliated with a specific county. we calculated incidence rates and death rates per 100,000 for each county and metropolitan area using the 2018 population data from the us census bureau.in order to examine spatial disparities between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties, we used urban-rural continuum locale codes from the us department of agriculture (usda). [28] [29] [30] briefly, the usda codes are based on the size of a county's urban population and its location relative to metropolitan areas of different sizes. counties located inside metropolitan statistical areas (msas) are divided into 3 subcategories: counties in the largest msas (1 million population or more) are assigned a locality of 1; counties with populations between 250,000 and 1 million, a locality of 2; and those with populations smaller than 250,000, a locality of 3. counties located outside any metropolitan area are assigned a subcategory ranging from 4 to 9 depending on the size of its urban population and whether it is adjacent to a metro area. among the 2,814 counties (nearly 90% of all counties in the united states) that have reported data on covid-19 infections and deaths, 431 are in large msas, 370 in medium-sized msas, 346 in small msas, and 1,667 are nonmetropolitan or rural counties. additionally, the census bureau classifies metropolitan counties into 2 subcategories: central or urban counties and outlying or suburban counties. these subcategories help to differentiate urban and suburban communities within metropolitan areas.to investigate the spatial variations of covid-19 cases and deaths, we performed multiple regression analyses using a subset of the original data-1624 counties with 16 or more cases-as recommended by cdc, in order to mitigate the analytical problems caused by counties with a small number of cases and to preserve the anonymity of cases. 31 confirmed cases and deaths for each county were used as the dependent variables, respectively. we used data on county-level social vulnerability indices in 2018 created by the cdc as independent variables. these indices included the percent of population aged 65+, the percent of the population in poverty, the percent minority, and percent uninsured. population density was considered the primary predictor since more densely populated communities make it easier for infections to spread; indeed, this is the rationale for the public health intervention of "social distancing." 32 because older individuals have a higher prevalence of preexisting chronic illnesses and are more vulnerable to symptomatic infections, we included the percent of the population aged 65 and above. 33 in light of well-documented health disparities between rich and poor and between whites and minorities (eg, blacks, hispanics, native americans), we hypothesized that the poverty level and the percentage of minority population would be positively correlated with disease burden. [34] [35] [36] [37] however, an assessment of the number of infections and deaths of covid-19 is largely dependent on the availability of testing. 38 we therefore included the percent of the population being tested at the state level, as testing data were not available at the county level. additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses using a smaller sample that comprised only 688 rural counties and including population density as the only independent variable in regression analysis to explore whether population density is a helpful predictor or not. because most rural areas are sparsely populated in the united states, it was expected that population density would be less effective in predicting the variations of coronavirus infections and deaths across rural communities.we excluded 7,445 cases (less than 1% of the total) that were not affiliated with a specific county. the covid-19 pandemic has affected 90% or 2,814 of us counties in all 50 states and washington dc, among which large cities and their associated metropolitan areas have been affected the most. new york city, the nation's largest city (2018 population of 8.4 million in its 5 boroughs), recorded 167,478 confirmed cases, representing 15.7% of the nation's total infections. the new york metropolitan area, which comprises 25 counties that span new york, new jersey, and pennsylvania (2018 population of 20 million), accounts for nearly 37% (or 394,259 confirmed cases) of the nation's infections (table 1) . after the new york metro, other metropolitan areas, including chicago, boston, philadelphia, detroit, los angeles, washington dc, miami, new orleans, and atlanta, are among the top 10 in terms of number of confirmed incident cases. the top 10 metropolitan areas represent nearly 61% of all confirmed cases of covid-19 in the united states.large metropolitan areas also have the highest number of coronavirus fatalities (table 1) . with 29,373 deaths, the new york msa accounts for nearly 47% of the total deaths nationwide, followed by other msas including detroit, boston, chicago, philadelphia, los angeles, washington dc, and new orleans. it is noteworthy that detroit and new orleans have become the second and eighth largest hotspots despite their population rankings, which are considerably lower (the 14th and 24th largest msas). los angeles and chicago, the second and third largest metropolitan areas, on the contrary, ranked lower in terms of both infections and deaths than their corresponding populations would suggest.more than 94.3% of all confirmed cases (1,061,223 of 1,068,668 as of may 1) and 96.3% of all deaths (62,295 out of 62,698) were recorded in 1,447 metropolitan counties (usda locale codes 1-3) ( table 2 ). in other words, 5.6% (59,940) of all infections and 3.7% (2333) of deaths were recorded in 1,667 nonmetropolitan or rural counties (usda locale codes 4-9). metropolitan counties, especially those located in large msas with populations more than 1 million, had the highest rates of infection and death rates. rural or nonmetropolitan counties, in general, had the lowest rates for both infection and mortality, especially in nonmetro counties with populations less than 19,999 and not adjacent to any msa (ie, locales 7 and 9) ( figure 1 ). however, it is noteworthy that some counties that are completely rural and/or those adjacent to msas but with urban populations less than 2,500 (ie, locale 8) had an average infection rate nearly as high as that in small msa counties (ie, locale 3). likewise, nonmetro counties with urban population between 2,500 and 100 * a total of 7,445 (or less than 1%) of confirmed cases and 643 (or less than 1%) of deaths in the original data were excluded because they were assigned at the state level but were not affiliated with a specific county. 19,999 and adjacent to msas (ie, locale 6) had an average mortality rate just below large and medium msa counties. within metropolitan areas, central or urban counties had much higher incidence and mortality rates than outlying or suburban counties ( figure 2 ). in summary, urban counties had the highest levels, rural counties the lowest levels, and suburban counties intermediate levels of incident and fatal covid-19 cases.mapping incidence and mortality rates at a more granular scale, for example, individual counties that are the building blocks of metropolitan areas, allows us to visualize more detailed patterns of covid-19 (figures 3  and 4 ). as noted above, it is not surprising that the highest infection rates are in large cities and their associated metropolitan areas, especially the northeast corridor that stretches from boston to washington dc, the midwest (ie, detroit and chicago), and new orleans. in addition to large metropolitan areas, small metropolitan areas and rural counties that are far away from major cities, including southwest georgia, northeast arizona, and northwest new mexico, that spans a large portion of the navajo nation, west-central colorado, and south-central idaho, show surprisingly high rates of confirmed cases. an inspection of the top 25 counties with the highest infection rates shows that 3 counties are in small msas and 11 counties are rural or nonmetro (see table 3 ). lincoln county, arkansas, an outlying county (population 13,695 in 2018) in the small pine bluff msa, had the highest infection rate (ie, 5,943.8 per 100,000 population), nearly 3 times larger than that in new york city (ranked 22 with an incidence rate of 1983.5 per 100,000 population). thus, several small metro areas and some rural areas are notable exceptions to the generalization that covid-19 cases are limited to large metropolitan areas.an examination of covid-19 mortality rates underscores the observation that small metropolitan areas and some nonmetropolitan counties are disproportionately affected (table 4) the county with the highest mortality rate (268.1 deaths per 100,000) is randolph, ga (population 7,087), a rural county near the alabama border (table 5) results of regression models for covid-19 incident cases are presented in table 6 . as expected, the variables population density, percent population aged 65+, and percent population tested for covid-19 showed statistically significant and positive correlations with confirmed cases of covid-19. population density is the strongest predictor of the variations of infections among counties and explains 43% of the variations of infections. the impact of testing rates is understandable and substantiates epidemiologists' call for expanding testing to control the spread of coronavirus. poverty and percent minority population were not significant and showed negative correlations with incidence rates. one possible explanation is that this reflects the likelihood that poverty and minority populations are factors that lead individuals to be untested. the percent uninsured population showed a positive sign but was not statistically significant, which could have also been affected by shortages of testing. overall, the regression model explained nearly half of the variation in incidence rates (45%) of covid-19 across 1,624 counties. multicollinearity was not a significant factor among the independent variables included in the model as the variance inflation factor (vif) values for each independent variable were as low as <2 (data not shown).results of a sensitivity analysis found that when only rural counties were used, population density became insignificant (b = 0.100; std error = 0.072) for infections and the model explained less than 1% of the variations of infections (adjusted r square = 0.001). this finding indicates that population density is less likely to be a risk factor for rural counties because rural areas in general have much lower population densities in comparison to their metropolitan counterparts.the results of regression model using covid-19 deaths as the dependent variable are similar to those observed in the model for confirmed cases. population density remained the strongest predictor of covid-19 mortality rates. the variables, percent older population and poverty, both showed expected significant and positive associations with covid-19 deaths. this is consistent with the hypothesis that the elderly and the poor are at greater risks of covid-19 deaths. the percent of the minority population was significant but negative. one possible explanation is that the data on coronavirus deaths are not disaggregated by race or ethnicity and whites were the majority in the death tolls for most counties. percent of the uninsured population was positive but was not significant, which could be a result of underestimates or undercounting of covid-19 induced fatalities, especially for those disadvantaged communities (ie, inner cities or remote rural communities). the regression model explains 39% of the variations of covid-19 across 1,624 counties. results from a sensitivity analysis using rural counties only and regressing mortality against population density alone were similar to the findings for infections.this article analyzes country-wide data from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic with a focus on spatial disparities among metropolitan and nonmetropolitan communities. as the covid-19 epidemic in most areas of the us continues to mount, these findings must be considered an interim appraisal. more definitive conclusions can only be reached once the epidemic has abated and when other relevant data, some not presently available, are included. however, several notable trends are apparent. large, densely populated cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas are the hotspots of the covid-19 pandemic both in terms of incidence and mortality. in general, the larger metropolitan areas, including both urban and suburban areas, have higher incidence and mortality rates than smaller and nonmetropolitan areas. however, as of may 1, nonmetropolitan areas that span 1,667 counties in the united states have amassed nearly 6% (or 60,000) of confirmed cases and 4% (or over 2,300) of deaths from covid-19. it is striking that the infection rates in some small metropolitan areas (eg, albany, ga; pine bluff, ar; grand island, ne) and numerous rural counties (eg, bledsoe, tn; nobles, mn; and marion, oh) ranked very high nationally. likewise, the mortality rates in some small metropolitan areas (eg, albany, ga; grant island, ne; houma-thibodaux, la; and farmington, nm) and nonmetropolitan counties (eg, randolph, early, and mitchell counties in southwest georgia and toole county in montana) actually exceed those of the larger cities. the complete explanation for this paradox is not apparent but likely involves chance or "local" factors that become important in smaller communities. for example, the high rates in albany, georgia, have been traced to the presence of an infected individual at 2 funerals that were highly attended. 39 the introduction of an infected individual thus can have a disproportionate effect on dis-ease rates when the population is relatively small but densely aggregated. additionally, it is likely that the limited health care facilities of small cities and rural communities are a critical bottleneck to access to services. many rural areas tend to have higher poverty rates and much older populations with a higher prevalence of comorbidities. these populations may be more vulnerable to symptomatic and more serious courses of disease than other populations. 40 regression analyses support the hypotheses of correlations between covid-19 infections and deaths and the selected socioeconomic contextual factors including population density, proportions of elderly residents, poverty, and testing at the state level. it is reasonable to suggest that densely populated areas and communities that are aging, poverty-stricken, and lack testing are more at risk of covid-19. moreover, results from the sensitivity analyses corroborate that population density is a more effective predictor of covid-19 infections and mortality for metropolitan areas, not for rural areas. the unexpected results for other socioeconomic risk factors, including proportion of minority and uninsured population, are largely due to the use of disaggregated data, undertesting, or underreporting. despite this weakness, our findings corroborate anecdotal observations and empirical research that highlight the vulnerability of those disadvantaged communities. 11, 38 our findings about the geographic heterogeneity and sociodemographic correlates of the covid-19 outbreak can inform policy and government efforts to address the uneven distribution of covid-19 cases across demographic groups and geographic areas. 38 given the fact of implementations of nationwide lockdown and social distancing practices, the pandemic may be showing signs of receding in large metropolitan areas, but it is predicted to continue to diffuse from cities to small places and rural communities. these findings support the provision of additional testing facilities and services, including mobile health clinics and telehealth services, to help the rural communities that have been underserved and undertested during this pandemic. [41] [42] [43] it is important to note that these data are subject to several methodological limitations, including the ecologic nature of the analysis and biases that are related to the under-(and sometimes over-) ascertainment of cases. first, the primary data in this spatial study are counties, not individuals. thus, we cannot validly conclude, for example, that because counties with a high prevalence of population aged 65 or above have higher mortality rates that individuals who are 65 or older will do so. furthermore, due to the unavailability of disaggregated data, our findings were based on analysis of total counts of infections and deaths in each county, prohibiting us from identifying disparities between demographic groups (eg, gender, age, or race/ethnicity) within the population. 44 it would obviously be valuable to conduct more in-depth analysis using individual-level data to examine racial/ethnic disparities in infection and mortality rates if data on racial/ethnic breakdowns are released by health agencies at later stages. our focus in this early analysis is to identify regions with geographic disparities in order to probe the underlying causes behind these. thus, the ecologic approach is a valid and appropriate first step in this process.ascertainment bias is another important, potential limitation. the incidence rate obviously depends on the frequency of testing. shortages of testing equipment remain a critical problem for both disease control and epidemiological analysis. therefore, low prevalence rates in many areas, especially sparsely populated rural counties, are likely artifacts of lower rates of testing, as validated by the positive association of infections and testing rate at the state level in our regression analysis. 38 thus, underascertainment should disproportionately reflect poorer, more rural counties, whose true prevalence rates will likely be higher than recorded. conversely, the data are also susceptible to inflation of mortality rates that can occur when individuals who are ill from etiologically unrelated diseases succumb to these diseases while they are infected. in large metropolitan areas, such as new york city, thousands of individuals may die each day due to noncoronavirus causes, such as lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, etc. in many individuals, the coronavirus infection doubtlessly exacerbated their pre-existing illness and, in this way, causally contributed to their deaths. however, deaths from these underlying causes in the presence of a positive covid-19 serological test is likely to be recorded as a "coronavirus death" even if the contribution of the virus to death was modest. that is, some deaths that under nonpandemic circumstances would be attributable to noncoronavirus causes likely will be counted as deaths due to coronavirus. the actual autopsy rate in the present health crisis is expected to be exceptionally low. this type of ascertainment bias likely would have complex, and different effects in rural than in metropolitan areas. for example, in rural areas, a lower rate of testing would fail to identify some decedents as coronavirus cases and likely would lead to an underestimate of the effect of the virus on mortality.in summary, our analysis found that covid-19 infections and deaths are (not surprisingly highly) concentrated in large cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas. however, equivalently high rates were found in small cities and nonmetropolitan or rural communities. communities with high proportions of elder populations, high poverty rates, and high population density are found at high risk of covid-19. moreover, the magnitude of infections and deaths is positively associated with testing rates at the state level, which supports expanding testing capacities to undertested areas, especially rural communities, to stem the spread of the virus. these findings are subject to ascertainment biases and should be considered provisional guides to the geography and underlying risk factors of the pandemic in the united states.in december 2019, a new coronavirus, now known as sars-cov-2, emerged in wuhan, china. this highly infectious virus leads to coronavirus disease 2019, or covid-19, and has given rise to a global pandemic. as of april 9, 2020, there had been over 1.59m confirmed cases, and over 95,000 deaths due to the disease (1).the covid-19 pandemic is unlike anything we have experienced in our lives, but there are some patterns to this catastrophic disease that are very familiar to those engaged in aging research. epidemiological analysis of cases and fatalities has identified numerous risk factors both for mortality from complications arising from covid-19. specifically, the risk of serious complications and mortality increases dramatically at later ages (2) (3) (4) , and is higher in males than in females at all ages (2, 4) . as a recent editorial in this journal noted, covid-19 could be considered a disease of older people (5) .the effect of age on risk of death due to covid-19 increases exponentially with age. case fatality rates (the risk of dying among those diagnosed with covid-19) are on the order of 0.1%(1 in 1000) in children, but as high as 14.8% in older individuals in china (3) and even higher in older italians (4) and americans (6) . this striking increase-over 100-fold-in risk over the lifespan, and the fact that men are more likely than women to die of covid-19, has caught the attention of the public.to fully understand the implications of these patterns of increased risk with age and in men versus women, we need to place them in the context of how age and sex affect the risk of chronic diseases. it has long been known not only that the risk of dying increases exponentially over the course of adult life, but also that this exponential increase holds for individual causes of death a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t (7) . we also observe a male bias in total mortality rates (8) , and in death due to specific diseases (9) .in this note, i consider age and sex as epidemiological risk factors for covid-19 in the context of other age-specific diseases, and suggest some insights that we might gain from this comparison.data on covid-19 cases and deaths were obtained for outbreaks in china (3), italy (4), and new york city (10). the data for italy provided estimates for case fatality rates (cfr). chinese data included corrections for several biases to provide a more accurate estimate of "infection fatality ratio" (ifr). new york city (10) provides measures in terms of deaths per 100,000 in the population, which measures the risk of dying of covid-19 for anyone in a particular age class, regardless of infection status. age classes for italy and china were calculated in 10-year intervals. in the plots for these sources, age shown is the youngest age in the interval. for new york city, there are fewer, larger age classes. for these data, death rates are plotted as a function of the mean age within each age class (e.g., for age 0-17 years, the age shown is 8.5 yrs). m a n u s c r i p tinformation on age-and sex-specific death rates (per 100,000 population in specified group) for the united states were obtained from the cdc's 2017 national vital statistics report (11) .death rates are typically averaged across 5-year intervals, and in the plots, age shown is the youngest age in the interval.all data analysis was carried out using the r statistical package. mortality rate doubling time (mrdt) is calculated as the time in years (δx) that it would take for a mortality rate at age x, µx, to double, such that µx+δx = 2µx. adult mortality rates increase exponentially with age, following a gompertz trajectory, µx = αe βx , so on a semi-log plot of log10(mortality) versus age, where the intercept is given by log(α), and the slope is equal to β, we can calculate the mrdt as δx = log10(2)/β. the 95% confidence intervals for mrdt are provided as direct derivations of the confidence intervals for β, determined using the confint function in r.to calculate β, we used the lm function in r to fit least-squares regression lines to plots of log10(mortality) versus age over the range of mid-adult life (ages 20-70 years), during which time we see consistently linear patterns of log-transformed mortality versus age. where fitted lines are shown, they are drawn over the range of ages that were used in the regression model.covid-19 fatality rates, whether calculated on a per-case basis (cfr in italy, ifr in china), or in terms of deaths per 100,000 in the population (for new york city), all exhibit a clear a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t pattern of exponential increase with age ( figure 1 ), for both males and females. we also observe male-biased mortality at all ages, a pattern that is clearly seen when cfr is plotted on a semi-log scale ( figure 1b) . the pattern of age-related severity in outcomes of covid-19 is mirrored in the overall mortality rate as a function of age. as previous studies have shown, cdc vital rate data (11) show an exponential increase with age for all-cause and cause-specific mortality ( figure 2 ).over the range of ages for which we calculate the slopes of log10(cfr) versus age, we see a consistently strong linear relationship, with r 2 ≥ 0.98 ( figure 1b,1d) . for all-cause mortality, mortality rates in the us appear to double approximately every 9 years (figure 2 ). for the subset of age-related causes of mortality shown in figure 2 , we see mrdts in years from a range of 4.7 (for copd, 95% ci = 4.5 -5.0) to 7.1 (for diabetes, 95% ci = 6.7 -7.5). for covid-19 cfr, mrdts were found to be 6.6 (italian females, 95% ci = 5.6 -7.9), 7.3 (italian males, 95% ci = 6.8 -7.9) and 6.9 (china, 95% ci = 6.1 -7.8). the new york data, calculated as death rate per 100,000, exhibits a shallower slope, leading to a doubling time of 9 years.for all major causes of mortality, males tend to have a higher risk of dying at all ages ( figure 3 ). this pattern is seen for risk of death from covid-19, and the scale of difference between sexes is consistent with that seen for more common causes of mortality. the y axis in figures 3a and   3b shows log-transformed mortality, with tick marks separating 10-fold differences. thus, although figure 3a shows deaths per 100,000 individuals, and figure 3b shows cfr, an equal a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t distance between males and females at a given age would suggest an equally increased risk for males. the data from italy show a clear male bias in cfr at all ages above 30, with cfr between 1.7 and 2.6 times greater in males than in females. although the bias is seen at all ages, there appears to be a reduction in the relative risk for males at later ages. the degree of male bias appears comparable to what we see for heart disease, but greater than that seen for death due to diabetes, or combined influenza and pneumonia ( figure 3a ).scientists (2, 3, 12) and the popular press have made much of the fact that age is the greatest risk factor for covid-19. the dynamics of age-specific mortality, including both the exponential increase with age and the similar doubling times, as well as the sex-bias in mortality seen for covid-19, mirror other major causes of mortality.a possible explanation for this age-related increase in risk of mortality could be the agerelated decline in immune and inflammatory responses, which can lead, in turn, to a cytokine storm (13) . this is a likely contributing factor, given that in general, age leads to a decline in adaptive immune function, and an increase in pro-inflammatory activity (14) . however, this is unlikely to be the complete story, for at least two reasons: first, virtually all physiological systems and cellular processes decline with age, not limited to immune and inflammatory pathways (15) , and second, there is a diversity of pre-existing conditions that appear to increase the risk of covid-19, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes (16) and high body mass index (17) . as people age, the average number of comorbid conditions steadily increases, and the greater the number of comorbid conditions, the lower the life expectancy (18) .a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p tthe geroscience concept holds that treatments that target the underlying molecular pathways of aging biology that shape this physiological decline could, in turn, decrease risk for many different age-related diseases and improve outcomes in those that succumb to disease (19, 20) . in light of the coronavirus pandemic, researchers have also suggested that putative 'geroprotective' treatments, such as rapamycin or senolytics, might be used to treat or prevent covid-19 (21, 22) . for example, it would be of great interest to understand the role of widely-known agingrelated molecular pathways-mtor signaling, iis signaling, cell senescence-in the response to coronavirus infection and recovery from covid-19. geroscience has seen major strategic advances for the discovery of treatments to increase healthspan in laboratory organisms (23) , and there is some evidence for the efficacy of longevity-derived interventions in treating acute symptoms of age-related disease at least in the lab (24, 25) . there can be no doubt as to the interaction of aging biology and covid-19 mortality, and its seems likely that a better understanding of this relationship would inform not only the biology of viral susceptibility and progression to life-threatening outcomes, but also how aging creates a pernicious environment that augments the negative consequence of viral load. for specific causes of mortality, mrdt 95% confidence intervals: all causes (8.6 -9.1); heart disease (6.4-7.6); malignant neoplasms (5.7 -7.0); copd (4.5 -5.0); diabetes (6.7 -7.5); kidney disease (6.4 -6.7). one" or also "tge2" and both these denominations referred to its clinical similarity to tge, a common cause of viral diarrhea in pigs in europe at that time. an important difference with tge was, however, that neonatal pigs were not affected. since these denominations were considered unsatisfactory from a scientific point of view, the name of the new syndrome was quickly changed to "epidemic diarrhea-ed".the first ed outbreak occurred on a farm in the spring of 1971 and the second 6 months later, at a distance of 2 miles from the http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.030 0168-1702/© 2016 elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.former. suckling piglets were not affected but pigs of 10 weeks and older and also adults showed an acute diarrhea lasting one week. the outbreak lasted 3-4 weeks on the farm. during the autumn of 1971 and also the following winter, several new outbreaks were reported. a clinical diagnosis and possibility for differentiation from tge was thus based on the high morbidity in fatteners and adult animals in the absence of disease in neonatal and freshly weaned pigs. in most of these diarrheal cases, tgev was excluded by laboratory examination. the fact that ed was observed on farms with a recent history of a tge outbreak, and thus in tgev immune animals, increased the conviction that tgev was not involved. during 1972, ed spread rapidly between pig farms, particulary fattening herds. mortality was rare and the effect of an outbreak was estimated at about 2 weeks feed cost.a similar disease pattern was observed during the early seventies in belgium and a rapid spread occurred to neighbouring countries in western europe. here also, suckling pigs were not affected and remained free of diarrhea even when their mothers suffered from a watery diarrhea during several days. some neonatal pig mortality could occur by starvation because the sick mothers often suffered from agalactia.an additional sign observed in belgium and later also reported in gemany, but not mentioned in england, was that some fatteners were found dead, particularly towards the end of the fattening period, and this occurred repeatedly in some farms but not in others. a mortality rate as high as 3% could be encountered. this was not due to dehydration accompanying the diarrhea but animals suddenly died from acute back muscle necrosis. while the clinical link with an ed infection was clear, the pathogenetic background has never been revealed. belgian pigs were highly stress positive at that time and a severe belly ache often observed in adult animals during an outbreak of ed may have been a trigger.in general, as no baby pig mortality occurred due to the ed agent, not very much attention was given to this new diarrheal syndrome and the etiology was not intensively investigated. however, it was assumed that a viral agent was involved since bacteriological examination of faecal material did not reveal a specific bacterial cause. none of the known porcine viruses could be associated and a new virus was, therefore, suspected.much changed in 1976 when wood (1977) from the veterinary investigation centre in norwich (england) described a new diarrheic syndrome. it differed from ed in that it now affected pigs of all ages, including neonatal and suckling pigs. mortality was variable, restricted to young piglets and averaged around 30%. this new disease now resembled tge more closely than ed did, but tgev was again excluded using direct immunofluorescence on intestines and applying established serological techniques available for detection of anti-tgev antibodies. now, a differentiation with tge on a clinical basis only became difficult, often impossible. this new syndrome was called ed2 to differentiate it from the 1971 ed1 where no baby pigs were involved. ed2 was economically much more important than ed1.ed2 also quickly spread to the european continent and was recognised in belgium in 1977. reports from other countries including the netherlands, germany, france, bulgaria, hungary and switzerland, followed soon. in belgium, mortality rates in neonates on breeding farms varied considerably. they could be as high as 80% (large variation from 30 to 80%) and the average was 50%. variation in mortality in neonatal pigs was litter bound, not explained at that time, but also farm bound where it appeared to be associated with farm size (still many small family farms at that time), farm struc-ture (one or several farrowing units), number of neonatal pig litters present at the start of the outbreak, number of pregnant sows due to farrow within one week of the appearance of disease signs and possibly other factors. differences in virulence of virus isolates was not given any attention.this new evolution to ed2 with the involvement of baby pigs and its larger economic impact yielded better opportunities for collecting material for etiological studies, for experimental reproduction of the disease and for the development of virological and serological techniques. in 1978, chasey and cartwright (1978) reported the detection of virus like particles, and pensaert and debouck (1978) described the isolation of a new coronavirus-like agent (cvla) from diarrheic pigs, with both research groups succeeding in reproducing diarrhea in experimental pigs. soon after the isolation of this new coronavirus, extensive pathogenesis studies were performed in colostrum deprived pigs with one of the belgian isolates, designated coronavirus cv777, (isolated in month 7 of 1977) which became the prototype strain for pedv in europe (debouck and pensaert, 1980; debouck et al., 1981) . ed2 was soon named "porcine epidemic diarrhea" (ped) caused by ped virus (pedv) a denomination which still stands at present.from the early studies with pedv in neonates (debouck and pensaert, 1980; debouck et al., 1981) it was soon clear that the pathogenesis resembled very much that of tgev. experience gathered from research with tgev helped much in the approach to study this new enteric disease. lack of success to cultivate the virus in cell cultures forced to produce clean virus stocks by oral inoculation of colostrum deprived pigs, performing surgery 18 h later and rinsing the in vivo produced virus from the lumen of the infected small intestines during 12 h while keeping the pig in the incubator (debouck and pensaert, 1980) . such "clean" pig adapted virus stocks served for experimental pig inoculation experiments and to produce an hyperimmune serum for the preparation of a conjugate for an immunofluorescence (if) conjugate to detect the virus in tissues. serological tests were developed to detect antibodies by elisa and to study possible relationship with other coronaviruses by immuno-electron microscopy . genome analysis of the ped isolate(s) was not available at that time.by immuno-electron microscopy and if, pedv was not related to any of the known porcine coronaviruses (tgev, haemagglutinating encephalo-myelitis virus) . some discrete relationship with members of the genus alpha-coronavirus was later demonstrated using other and more sensitive tests. the origin of pedv was thus unknown and no potential parent coronavirus could be indicated.an elisa test was soon used for routine serology . a crucial question was whether or not the ed1 agent and ed2/pedv were related or whether ed2/pedv was totally new. infectious material containing the ed1 agent from earlier outbreaks was not available. a retrospective serological survey was carried out on sow sera that had been collected in slaughterhouses in belgium starting in 1969 and thus prior to the emergence of ed1 in 1972 on the european continent. antibodies to pedv were not found in sera collected in 1969 but were present in 7% of the sows collected in 1971, in 42% of the sows in 1975 and in 32% of the sows in 1980. these results indicated that the coronavirus ped had been responsible for first ed1 outbreaks, for the ed2 outbreaks and thus it can be accepted that pedv emerged in 1971 but later widened its host tropism from growing and adult swine towards neonatal pigs. this finding was interesting from an evolutionary point of view.thus, pedv that presumably started as a cause of diarrhea in 1971 in feeders, fatteners and adult swine, had suddenly acquired tropism for neonatal pigs and now became a rather devastating disease. but even after the emergence of ed2/pedv, some outbreaks on breeding-finishing farms still did not involve neonatal pigs. while it was assumed that both ed1 and pedv were co-circulating in the swine population, it is also possible that some farms had experienced an earlier ed1 infection and that immune sows protected their offspring against pedv by lactogenic immunity while groups of fattening pigs had become susceptible. it must, however, be mentioned that cross-protection between ed1 and pedv has never been studied. also, after a first epidemic phase of the new pedv, the virus often persisted on breeding-finishing farms in weaned and feeder pigs (endemic ped). the sow population was immune, protecting its offspring, while feeder pigs became susceptible after loosing their maternal protection. the highly variable and mixed clinical picture was, at that time, ascribed to the possible co-circulation of the original ed1 agent and its presumed variant pedv in the population. genome analysis was not available and ed1 infectious material is also now no longer available to retrospectively examine this issue.ed2/pedv is likely a variant of ed1. that variants of pedv relatively easy emerge is not unusual as animal coronaviruses are known to easily undergo genetic alterations.recombination and insertions and deletions have repeatedly been demonstrated in pedv by genome analyses of isolates during more recent outbreaks in asia and in the usa (fan et al., 2012; li et al., 2016; jarvis et al., 2016; vlasova et al., 2014; oka et al., 2014) .even now (2016) in recent cases of ped in europe, varying types of clinical manifestations, either with or without affection of neonatal pigs, are observed (see later).the question on the origin of pedv (and thus of its presumed ancestor ed1 agent) in 1971 is unanswered. there are no indications for a possible evolution from another known so called "parental" coronavirus, even after comparative studies with the known coronaviruses using detailed genome analyses of different genes including the s gene. so far, only discrete antigenic relationship involving the n protein but without any cross protection was detected with some of the other animal members of the genus alphacoronavirus such as feline infectious peritonitis virus (fipv), tgev, porcine respiratory coronavirus (prcv), canine coronavirus (ccov) and mink coronavirus (mcv). by the use of monoclonal antibodies to the n proteins of the human alphacoronaviruses nl63 and 229e, no cross reactivity was detected with pedv (sastre et al., 2011) . the only alphacoronavirus in which also the m proteins cross reacts with pedv is mcv (have et al., 1992) .the nucleotide sequence of the pedv nucleocapsid gene and of typical coronavirus motifs show that pedv, within the region of the genome sequenced, shows indeed greatest homology to the human 229e, tgev, prcv, fipv, ccov and feline enteric coronavirus (fecv) (bridgen et al., 1993) . it is interesting to mention that, similar to pedv, several of the other alphacoronaviruses, including the human 229e, tgev, prcv, ccov, fecv and fipv use the cellular receptor aminopeptidase n (apn) for virus entry into cells in their host (weiss and navas-martin., 2005) and this seems to be a common evolutionary characteristic. still, the genetic and antigenic diversity between pedv and the other alphacoronaviruses is very largealso, no cross-reactivity has been reported between pedv and the coronaviruses belonging to the beta, gamma or delta genera.the genomic data presented above and the use of the same cellular receptor suggest a common origin of some of some of these alphacoronaviruses. a carrier-wild animal species as source of the virus, as often described with other coronaviruses, cannot be excluded.soon after its detection, experimental studies in neonatal pigs revealed that target cells of pedv were limited to the epithelium covering the intestinal villi and the pathogenesis was thus highly similar to that of tgev (debouck and pensaert, 1980; debouck et al., 1981) . cv777 virus infection in the villous enterocytes in neonatal pigs caused rapid cell desquamation throughout the small intestine within 24-36 h after inoculation which was somewhat slower than observed with tgev. still, the villous atrophy induced by pedv was so abrupt and extensive that rapid and severe dehydration occurred leading to death in neonatal pigs. due to this similarity in pathogenesis with tgev, much of the scientific knowledge acquired on tge diagnosis, −immunity, −prevention could be almost invariably applied to ped. an apparent difference with tgev, probably of minor importance from a clinical point of view, was that epithelial cells on colonic villi were also infected but desquamation was not observed. still now, it is a question if this colonic site of replication contributes to disease severity. ped diarrhea in fatteners and sows is often accompanied by an apparent belly ache, a clinical sign not seen with tge, and the question arises if the colon infection may contribute to this clinical manifestation.results of pathogenesis studies obtained in caesarean derived, colostrum deprived neonatal pigs upon inoculation with the european prototype strain cv777 of the seventies, were practically identical to those observed more recently in asia and in the usa epidemics with the so-called "original us pedv strains" stevenson et al., 2013; kim and chae, 2003) .a point of debate in the pedv evolution, particularly since its occurrence in asia and its emergence the usa, is the arising of pedv genetic variants influencing virulence. the history in europe, here presented, allows to assume that ed2/pedv was a variant of ed1 which had acquired tropism for intestinal enterocytes in neonatal pigs. this new tropism expanded and increased the virus virulence since a vulnerable age became affected and piglets mortality became an important economic aspect of the disease. currently, two major pedv variants are described in the usa upon routine genome analyses of usa isolates. the first, also called "original us pedv ", appears to be "highly virulent" while the second, the so called s-indel strains, standing for insertions and deletions in the s gene of the virus, are associated with mild(er) clinical outbreaks. similar genotypic variants have been detected in asia, the s-indels already before 2010 and the highly virulent since 2010. when adopting this genomic identification, it appears that cv777 is classified as a s-indel isolate apparently belonging to a different cluster compared to the us indels (carvajal et al., 2015) . considering the pathogenesis and virulence of the european prototype strain cv777 of the seventies as evaluated by the sites and degree of replication and the degree of villous atrophy, no real difference exists with the more recent highly virulent (original us pedv) isolates from the usa. for example, the pig adapted c777 when experimentally inoculated in neonatal piglets, caused villous atrophy with villous length reduction from the normal value of 700-900 m to as low as 200-300 m throughout the small intestine and within 6-36 h after the start of the diarrhea coussement et al., 1982) .much depends on how virulence of pedv is determined. if virulence of a pedv isolate is considered merely from the point of view of virus-neonatal pig interaction with parameters such as duration of incubation period, rapidity and severity of enterocyte desquamation, degree and extent of atrophy of villi, production of virulent virus quantities and severity of diarrhea, then cv777 can be classified as highly virulent despite its identification with s-indel isolates.that s-indels isolates do not systematically mean low virulence was recently shown in a us study (chun-ming et al., 2015) in which 4 litters of 3-4 days old suckling pigs were inoculated with the s-indel iowa 106 strain in the presence of their ped negative mothers. the severity of clinical signs and the mortality of the pigs varied between the 4 liters (from 0% to 75%). severe clinical signs were observed in 2 of the 4 litters. two of the 4 sows developed diarrhea. it was observed that, despite similar background of sows and environment in this experiment, the severity of disease was rather variable. it appeared that the pigs' body weight at birth and the sows health conditions and lactation were influential factors. in the same experiment mentioned above (chun-ming et al., 2015) , one litter was also inoculated with an original us pedv strain of high virulence. it was concluded that virulence of the s-indel isolate was generally lower based on the longer incubation period, the shorter duration of diarrhea, more limited regions of virus infection, overall lower pig mortality (18% vs 55% for "original") and some other additional parameters.the sites and extent of the deletions or insertions and the seqence differences in the s gene may play an important role. in a recent publication (chen et al., 2016 ) the pathogenicity differences between 3 u.s.pedv prototype strains and a s-indel-variant stain were compared in conventional neonatal pigs under experimental infections and enteric disease, as evidenced by clinical signs,fecal virus shedding, gross and histopathological intestinal lesions, were significantly lower for the s-indel strain.however,the molecular basis for the virulence differences were not elucidated.since the early beginning in europe, it was clear that ped disease can show much variability even in different litters of pigs particularly when suckling their mother. such differences and the high variation in pig mortality in different litters (from 30 to 80%) was an observation also made in the seventies in europe when the first epidemic occurred and the reason was never unravelled.even more variability is experienced when virulence and severity of ped disease is related to the interaction virus-farm population and thus in field outbreaks. the result of a ped outbreak will be much more difficult to predict, to evaluate and to define since, next to possible virulence differences of the isolates and next to variation among litters in suckling pigs, many additional factors play a role in determining the clinical outcome of the infection. they include immune status of sows, dose of virus exposure on the farm, herd size and pig farming management and others, all of which may be interacting in a different way. moreover, the procedures applied for intentional infection (feed back) of the sow population to speed up the induction of immunity to be passively transfered to the litter could be considered as a potential cause of worsening of the clinical status of the suckling pigs. in fact, that practice can also be a source of other pathogens for gilts/sows and/or for newborn piglets. it is thus possible that, particularly in a fully susceptible pig population and even with pedv strains of similar virulence, the mortality rates and losses are much higher in some continents or regions or farms with extensive and highly industrialised pig farming. the overall health status of the population apparently also plays an important role.while genomic changes surely will occur in ped virus isolates, it is advised to be careful when associating them with virulence changes. when a different clinical picture is observed on farms, it is often too hastily concluded that variants with varying virulence have arisen based on genome analysis only and without testing for virulence factors in experimental pigs.while genome analysis is certainly useful and may be directional, repeated comparative animal inoculation experiments with so called new isolates, clinically denominated as candidate "virulence-variants", need to be carried out in a standardized way before solid conclusions about virulence are made. this is indicated by the large variations very often observed with one and the same isolate. the neonatal, non suckling pig, preferably colostrum deprived, is reliable and even essential for this purpose. parameters as duration of incubation period, a timewise follow up of site and degree of villous affection in the small intestine are needed and must be repeated before calling a pedv isolate a variant with impact on virulence. it should be stressed that pig adapted virus strains should be used as it is known that major genomic modifications can arise when pedv is cell culture passaged, as well in porcine as in non-porcine cells, such as in vero cells.the epidemiology of ped in europe has been and still is quite puzzling. pedv outbreaks in the late seventies and early eighties occurred both on breeding and fattening swine farms. acute outbreaks with neonatal pig mortality were encountered in the breeding-fattening farms which became infected for the first time. pedv often became endemic. in farrowing-finishing farms, successive groups of pigs became infected upon weaning and after losing their lactogenic protection from their immune mothers, so that the virus could persist. whether the virus persisted or not after the original outbreak was somewhat unpredictable, as it could also disappear from the farm. the farm size (number of sows) and its structure (number of units) played a role. also ped persistence regularly occurred in fattening farms using the system of continuous introduction of feeder pigs originating from numerous and different breeders. a typical case of persistent diarrhea caused by pedv lasting 10 months on a breeding-finishing farm was described in the netherlands (pijpers et al.,1993) and this was a feature regularly observed in europe in the eighties. recent experience in the usa (2013) (2014) (2015) , has shown that management practices adopted in the epidemic phase of the infection can turn ped to a endemic/enzootic and long lasting form (jung and saif, 2015) .pedv infections were a regular cause associated with viral diarrheal picture in weaned and feeder pigs. in a serological study in belgium in 1986, pedv was associated with diarrhea in 13 out of 16 groups of feeder pigs after arrival in fattening farms (callebaut et al., 1986) but, the virus remained prevalent in the swine populations of western europe during the eighties. a serosurvey in belgian sows using sera collected in slaughterhouses, and thus mostly originating from different farms, showed pedv antibodies 32% in 1980 and 19% in 1984 . similar percentages of sows were positive in germany (on 3 regional locations), france, spain, the netherlands and bulgaria while no antibodies were found in scandinavia, northern ireland, usa or australia . in 1982, antibodies were detected in sera received from taiwan (the first evidence of the presence of pedv in asia).as the eighties advanced, fewer outbreaks on breeding farms were seen even though the virus was still detected but the general economic impact of ped had become lower. in belgium in 1992, 17 groups of feeder pigs from 15 commercial finishing herds, using the all in-all out production system, were examined for serocoversion to pedv and tgev. none of the groups seroconverted to tgev while 7 seroconverted to pedv with diarrhea observed in all 7 (van reeth and pensaert, 1994) . in an hungarian study published in 1996, 5.5% of 92 faecal samples from weaned pigs with diarrhea tested positively for pedv (nagy et al., 1996) .during the nineties, an acute ped outbreak which was described in spain involving a fattening unit of 5000 pigs with diarrhea starting in 7-9 weeks old pigs in one barn affecting pigs from 20 to 90 kg and subsequently spreading to the other barns (carvajal et al., 1995) . an isolated outbreak was described, in 1998 in england, in a large finishing herd where weaners were brought in over a 2 month period and positive sows were found in the breeding herds supply-ing the weaners (pritchard et al., 1999) . but, no further epidemic of ped occurred despite a very low pedv seroprevalence as only 1.9% of fatteners from 64 different finishing units were positive for antibodies to pedv(may 1996 -january 1997 .interest from a disease and economic point of view became very low in europe and no further research was performed on ped. practically no serosurveys were carried out. a serological survey in sows from farrow to finish herds carried out in belgium in 1996 revealed that gilts were positive for pedv antibodies in only 2 of the 144 considered farms, and in 1997, 72 fattening farms were examined for pev antibodies and none were positive (pensaert, unpublished) .it appeared that pedv, except for a focal case, was disappearing from the european swine population towards the turn of the century. for this reason, no attention or follow up was given anymore to this viral infection while its field of interest had fully moved to asia.however, a somewhat atypical ped outbreak occurred unexpectedly in the po valley in northern italy in 2006, (martelli et al., 2008) . it occurred between may 2005 and june 2006 in an area densely populated with pigs. the outbreak started with four cases occurring in fattening farms from may to july. no clinical cases were detected during august and september. in october, two new cases appeared: the first in a fattening unit and the second in the nursery of a three-site production unit. the disease spread during the winter of 2005-2006, affecting more than 60 farms including fattening units as well as farrow-to-finish or farrow-to-weaner farms. some pedv positive farms were still detected between mid-2006 and the end of 2007, but the disease progressively disappeared (sozzi et al., 2014) . from 2008-2014, only sporadic outbreaks were observed in grower and finisher herds (efsa, 2014) . this epidemic in italy in 2006-2007 inclined us to forecast a new episode of ped epidemics in europe but it did not occur.recently and due to an increased attention following the 2013 epidemic in the usa, single or limited ped outbreaks have sporadically been diagnosed in europe. one case in ukraine, (dastjerdi et al., 2015) occurred in a 5000-sow farm (240 farrowings a week) and mortality in pigs less than 10 days old approached 100%. the virus was closely related to "original us" strains reported form north america (sequence identity of 99.8%).isolates from other cases reported from belgium (theuns et al., 2015) , holland (van der wolf et al., 2015) , france (grasland et al., 2015) , germany hanke et al., 2015) and portugal (mesquita et al., 2015) and italy were, on the basis of genetic sequence, closely related to each other. when sequenced, they were classified as s-indel strains, and the german isolate showed 99.4% identity to the oh851 strain isolated in the usa in january 2014 . the size and clinical disease in these outbreaks were very variable. the outbreak involved in belgium: 1 fattening farm (no mortality), in france: 1 farrow to finish farm (mortality 12% in pigs at one week and 25% at weaning), in germany: 4 farms (2 fattening with 1.5% and 2% mortality, 2 breeding with 70% and no mortality, respectively) and in portugal where it started in one farm (with pig mortality, but not further defined) and where the virus spread to 43 other pig farms during a period of 3 months. from these data, it can be seen that, again, there was much and unexplained variation in ped clinical disease and outcome. except for the possibility of the outbreak in ukraine, it is very doubtful that the other european isolates have anything to do with those involved in the us epidemic. similar focal cases must have occurred in europe before the us outbreak but were, most likely, neither recognized nor diagnosed nor reported as ped. s-indel strains have been present in europe as cv777 appears to be the earliest known representative (carvajal et al., 2015) .it is remarkable that, in many european countries, no large epidemic occurred despite several indications that the breeding population in their densely populated swine raising regions is negative for antibodies to pedv and thus presumably fully susceptible.it is difficult to understand why a virus such as pedv has gradually regressed in the swine population in europe in the absence of any special control measures. vaccination has not been applied and no control programmes have been installed. the puzzling aspect is that, during the last decennia, pedv was and still is focally present in europe and did not cause an epidemic despite the high numbers of susceptible-seronegative farms and despite the very dense swine populations in some regions.one would expect that a virus such as pedv, which replicates to very high titers in swine and which can easily and rapidly spread from one swine farm to another, would be able to maintain itself in the swine population. as previously explained, once an outbreak has occurred on a breeding farm, pedv virus could persist easily when successive litters of pigs, after losing their lactogenic protection at weaning, become a susceptible target for infection. in fact, persistence for a virus such as pedv would be almost as a "natural" feature similar to the endemic character observed with other porcine enzootic enteric viruses such as swine rotaviruses, swine enteroviruses and others. tgev cannot serve as an example here because, in europe, it has largely been eliminated from the swine population due to the emergence, in the early eighties, of the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (prcv). prcv is a tgev deletion mutant which has acquired respiratory tropism and shows an epidemiological advantage of rapid aerogenic spreading while causing a protective immunity to tgev. endemic prcv has thus "replaced" tgev in europe.it would be interesting to study the mechanisms behind the regression/waning of pedv in europe. could it be that the virus has a non swine ancestor which has temporarily become adapted to swine but which is not really swine-borne? such evolution would not be unique for animal coronaviruses. could it be that the virus can maintain itself in the population only when present at a sufficient high dose allowing it to continue the infection chain but once reaching a low level quantity,e.g on a farm basis, is not longer able to do so? the waning of pedv has apparently not occurred in parts of asia within its 2-3 decennia of presence on that continent to the same degree as it did in europe, and it will be intriguing to closely follow the epidemiological course and evolution of pedv in the usa, once the epidemic phase has passed.coronavirus disease-19 is the disease caused by 2019-ncov/sars-cov-2, a novel β coronavirus of group 2b [1] . the illness ranges from asymptomatic or mild infection to severe respiratory tract infections in humans such as those seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). presentations include fever, coughing, dyspnea, watery diarrhea, myalgia, severe lymphopenia, prolonged coagulation profiles, cardiac disease, and sudden death [2, 3] .since the emergence in wuhan, hubei province, china in december 2019, covid-19 has increased rapidly in china and progressed worldwide. on january 30, 2020, who declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (pheic). as of may 27, 5,488,825 cases have been confirmed globally, including in americas, europe, eastern mediterranean, south-east asia, and africa, and 349,095 deaths have been reported [4] . coagulopathy was reported, and d-dimer elevations were seen in 3.75-68.0% of the covid-19 patients [2, 5, 6] . previous studies in community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients have shown that d-dimer level is higher in severe cases and may be used as a prognostic biomarker [7] [8] [9] , and d-dimer > 1 μg/ml is one of the risk factors for mortality in adult inpatients with covid-19 [6] . however, the role of d-dimer in covid-19 patients has not been fully investigated. in this study, we showed d-dimer levels in patient groups stratified by clinical severities, imaging staging, in-hospital death, and assessed the role of d-dimer as a biomarker for disease severity and clinical outcome.we enrolled patients of confirmed covid-19 referred to the renmin hospital of wuhan university (wuhan, china), a designated center prioritized in treating critical illness, from january 28 to march 08, 2020. confirmed cases were defined as those with epidemiological history, consistent with two clinical manifestations, and microbiological evidence (respiratory or blood specimens positive for sars-cov-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay or virus gene sequencing) according to the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guideline (6th ed.) (in chinese) published by the national health commission of china [10] . symptom onset is determined by the earliest clinical manifestations consistent with covid-19, such as fever, cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, diarrhea, and fatigue, recorded in medical history taken upon admission. exclusion criteria included pregnancy, cancer, hematologic malignancy, chronic liver disease, acute coronary syndrome, surgery or trauma within 30 days, and patients without d-dimer testing upon admission. we retrospectively collected demographic, clinical data, laboratory parameters, chest ct imaging, and prognosis through electronic nursing and medical records using standardized data collection form. this study was approved by the institutional ethics board of renmin hospital of wuhan university (no. wdry2020-k048).complete blood count, coagulation profile, renal and liver function, creatine kinase, electrolytes, myocardial enzymes, cd4 and cd8 cell counts, c-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were collected routinely on admission. d-dimer level is tested using immunoturbidimetric assay with reference range of 0-0.50 mg/l (sysmex, cs5100). doppler ultrasound and ct pulmonary angiography were done for any patients with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (pe/ dvt). chest ct scan was done for all inpatients.clinically, severity of the covid-19 patients was classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill according to the novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guideline (6th ed.) by the national health commission of china (supplement  table 1 ) [10] . radiologically, the area of affected lungs consistent with viral pneumonia in each patient's first chest ct after admission was measured and classified into ≤ 30%, 31-50%, and ≥ 50% of total lung area. according to oxygenation index (oi) at admission, patients were grouped into 4 groups (group 1, oi ≥ 400 mmhg; group 2, oi 300-399 mmhg; group 3, oi 200-299 mmhg; group 4, oi < 200 mmhg). the scores of sofa, qsofa, itsh for disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic), curb-65 for communityacquired pneumonia and wells' rule [11] , and the revised geneva score [12] for assessing pulmonary embolism (pe) risk for each patient were documented.continuous data accorded with normal distribution and homogeneity of variance were expressed as mean ± sd and compared by independent samples t test or expressed as median (25-75th percentile) and compared by wilcoxon rank sum test. categorical variables were expressed as number (percentage) and compared by chi-square tests or fisher's exact test. to explore the risk factors associated with mortality, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used. considering the total number of deaths (n = 17) in our study and to avoid overfitting in the model, we excluded variables from the univariable analysis if their betweengroup differences were not significant and if the number of events was too small to calculate odds ratios. therefore, we chose age, sofa, qsofa, isth-dic score, curb-65, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer as the seven variables for our multivariable logistic regression model. correlations of d-dimer with clinical staging, chest ct staging, oxygenation index, and in-hospital mortality were evaluated by kendall's tau-b coefficient analysis. to assess the predictive value of d-dimer for mortality, receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis was conducted with calculations of the area under the roc curve (auc), sensitivity and specificity. statistical analyses were performed with spss (v.22.0; spss inc., chicago, il, usa), and p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.as a designated referral center for the novel coronavirus infection, all the patients hospitalized were confirmed with rt-pcr. after excluding subjects using the exclusion criteria, we included 248 consecutive inpatients between january 28 and march 8, 2020, in the final analysis. the mean age of the 248 patients was 63.0 ± 13.4 years, ranging from 27 to 88 years. the average time from symptom onset to admission was 11.5 ± 5.1 days. nearly one third of the patients had comorbidities, with hypertension being the most common (31.5%), followed by diabetes mellitus (17.7%). mild to moderate cases, severe cases, and critically ill cases accounted for 36.3%, 43.5%, and 20.2% of the patients, respectively. average length of hospital stay was 30.8 ± 12.4 days. using the revised geneva score, none belonged to the high probability group for risk of pe. four patients belonged to the high probability group using the wells' rule. fortunately, they were ruled out of pe/vte by doppler ultrasonography and ct pulmonary angiography. seventeen patients died during hospitalization. d-dimer elevation (≥ 0.50 mg/l) was seen in 74.6% (185/248) of the patients.since all patients with normal d-dimer (< 0.5 mg/l) at admission survived, patients were grouped into ddimer levels of < 1, 1-2, and > 2 mg/l in the univariable and multivariable logistic regression models (table 1 ). in univariable analysis, age, sofa score, qsofa score, isth-dic score, curb-65, lymphocytopenia, and elevated d-dimer were associated with death. when these variables were included in the multivariable logistic regression model, d-dimer greater than 2 mg/l at admission was the only variable associated with increased odds of mortality [or 10.17 (95% ci 1.10-94.38), p = 0.041].the comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics between the normal d-dimer group and elevated d-dimer group are shown in table 2 . major laboratory markers and chest imaging features upon admission were recorded (table 3) . 35.5%, 31.0%, and 33.5% of the patients had affected lungs of ≤ 30%, 31-50%, and ≥ 50% of the total area. the predominant changes seen were ground glass opacity (54.0%), followed by patchy consolidation (21.4%), fibrous stripes (12.9%), and irregular consolidated nodules (11.7%). 67.7% of the patients received oxygen therapy, including nasal cannula/face mask (52.0%), non-invasive mechanical ventilation (10.5%), invasive mechanical ventilation (5.2%), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in one patient. anticoagulation therapy was prescribed in 34.3% of the cases.the distributions of d-dimer levels among patients with different clinical staging, chest ct staging, and who survived and deceased during hospitalization are presented in figs roc analysis identified d-dimer > 2.14 mg/l upon admission as the optimal cutoff level to discriminate survivors from non-survivors (area under the roc 0.85, standard error 0.037; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.77-0.92, p = 0.000; fig. 5 ). 32.7% of the included patients had a d-dimer of > 2.14 mg/l. for predicting in-hospital mortality, d-dimer level above 2.14 mg/l had a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 71.3% (table 4 ).we demonstrated that in patients diagnosed with covid-19, d-dimer elevation upon admission was common and was associated with both increased disease severity and in-hospital mortality. d-dimers are one of the fragments produced when plasmin cleaves fibrin to break down clots. the assays are routinely used as part of a diagnostic algorithm to exclude the diagnosis of thrombosis. however, any pathologic or non-pathologic process that increases fibrin production or breakdown also increases plasma d-dimer levels [13] . examples include deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and conditions such as pregnancy, inflammation, cancer, chronic liver diseases, post trauma and surgery status, and vasculitis. among adults admitted to the emergency room, infections, instead of vte/pe, are the most common reason for d-dimer elevation [14] . in the present study, no patient had confirmed pe/dvt, which supports the application of d-dimer in covid-19 not just as a diagnostic tool for thromboembolism. in addition, only three patients in the elevated d-dimer several studies have shown that d-dimer levels are associated with severity of community-acquired pneumonia and clinical outcome [7, 15] . however, ddimer has not been used as a biomarker for viral pneumonia [16, 17] . though d-dimer elevation has been observed in articles describing the clinical features of covid-19, whether the level of d-dimer is a marker of severity has not been examined.in the present study, there is a significant correlation between d-dimer levels and disease severity stratified by the area of affected lungs on chest ct, oxygenation index, as well as clinical staging according to the interim guideline. in addition, a higher percentage of d-dimer elevation was seen in the present study than previously reported [2, 5] . this may be due to the higher percentage of severe/critically ill cases referred to our hospital, which is another demonstration of the correlation between d-dimer level and disease severity. this suggests that the assay may be used early as a marker of severity before chest ct scans or as a complement to ct and clinical staging.in-hospital mortality was also associated with increased d-dimer levels, suggesting that the assay may be used as a single useful biomarker for clinical outcome in patients with covid-19. zhou et al. reported that d-dimer > 1 μg/ml is a risk for mortality [6] . the study objective, design, population, and statistical analysis of zhou's study and those of ours are different. zhou's study was a retrospective cohort study to describe risk factors for mortality and clinical course, which included patients who had been discharged or had died by january 31, 2020. the mortality rate was higher compared to that in our study (28.3% vs. 6.9%). to explore risk factor for mortality, zhou et al. chose age, coronary heart disease, sofa score, lymphocyte, and d-dimer as variables for multivariable logistic regression model. d-dimer was defined as a categorical variable in the analysis, and levels of ≤ 0.5 μg/l, > 0.5 to ≤ 1 μg/l, and > 1 μg/l were chosen. the laboratory method for d-dimer assay was not described. in the present case control study, we focused on the predictive value of d-dimer for in-hospital deaths using receiver operating characteristic analysis. in the analysis, d-dimer is defined as a continuous variable. testing used immunoturbidimetric assay with reference range of 0-0.50 mg/l (sysmex, cs5100). despite the differences in study design and analysis, the findings and conclusions of the two studies are not inconsistent. zhou et al. concluded that the potential risk factors of older age, high sofa score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/l (instead of levels of ≤ 0.5 μg/l, or > 0.5 to ≤ 1 μg/l) could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis. we found that when using the cutoff value of 2.14, d-dimer levels upon admission for in-hospital mortality has an auc of 0.846. the sensitivity and specificity are 88.2% and 71.3%, respectively. the findings of this present study suggest that an elevated d-dimer level on admission (> 2.14 mg/l) may identify patients at higher risk for in-hospital mortality and therefore inform physicians about suitable candidates for intensive care and early intervention.it is worth noting that the findings suggest associations between d-dimer levels and disease severity and mortality only. evidence is still lacking as to the causal mechanisms and whether the associations are specific effects of sars-cov-2 infection or are consequences of systemic inflammatory response. in sars-cov-2 infection, dysregulation of coagulation/anti-coagulation cascades results in worsening lung pathology [18] . in influenza, the pathogenesis by augmenting viral replication and immune pathogenesis can be attributed to an aberrant coagulation system, including both the cellular and protein components [19] . the pathological features of covid-19 include diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation, pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, which greatly resemble those seen in sars and mers coronavirus infection [20, 21] . presumably, the observed d-dimer elevation signify a hyperfibrinolysis state and increased inflammatory burden induced in sars-cov-2 infection. in our logistic regression model to estimate risk factors associated with mortality, systematic anticoagulation therapy was not significantly associated with reduced risk of mortality. however, in a recent observational study including 2773 hospitalized covid-19 patients, paranjpe et al. found that treatment dose anticoagulant was associated with a reduced risk of mortality, especially among patients who required mechanical ventilation [22] . and longer duration of treatment was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (adjusted hr of 0.86 per day, 95% ci 0.82-0.89, p < 0.001). whether anticoagulation fig. 4 a 59-year-old male diagnosed with covid-19 who presented with fever, coughing, and hemoptysis. chest ct upon admission showing ground glass opacities and patchy consolidation (a). he had an elevated d-dimer level of 9.43 mg/l. wells' score, geneva score, and curb65 score were 7, 7, and 2 respectively. wells' score suggested high probability of pulmonary embolism. ct pulmonary angiography (b, c) and doppler ultrasonography (d) were then carried out and ruled out pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities therapy confers a survival benefit in patients hospitalized for covid-19 needs further research with prospective randomized trials. currently, the potential benefits need to be weighed against risk of bleeding.this study has some limitations. first, the current study was done in a single center. the overall mortality (6.9%) was lower compared with that reported in other studies done in wuhan [2, 6] and considerably higher than those reported by other provinces [5, 23] . further researches may be needed when extrapolated to wider patient population. second, the study is retrospective in nature. the patients included were not systematically assessed for the presence of pe/dvt but only when clinically suspected. third, we did not look into the value of serial d-dimer monitoring in assessing covid-19 patients.in conclusion, d-dimer levels are commonly elevated in patients infected with sars-cov-2. significantly higher levels are found in those with critical illness and may be used as a prognostic marker for inhospital mortality.supplementary information accompanies this paper at

system to predict mortality risk in covid-19 patients.methods: a cohort of 1,663 hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan, china, of whom 212 died and 1,252 recovered, were included in the present study. demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on admission were collected from electronic medical records between january 14, 2020, and february 28, 2020. clinical outcomes were collected until march 26, 2020.multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between potential risk factors and covid-19 mortality. the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to predict covid-19 mortality risk. all analyses were conducted in april 2020. the independent risk factors for covid-19 mortality included older age, male sex, history of diabetes, lymphopenia, and increased procalcitonin, which could help clinicians to identify covid-19 patients with poor prognosis at an earlier stage. the covid-19 mortality risk score model may assist clinicians in reducing covid-19-related mortality by implementing better strategies for more effective use of limited medical resources.in december 2019, several pneumonia cases of unknown origin were identified in wuhan, hubei, china. 1, 2 the pathogen has been identified as a novel coronavirus, belonging to the βcoronavirus genus, and has been renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2, previously named 2019-ncov). 3 this novel virus shared 87.99% sequence identity to bat sars-like coronavirus, and 79.5% of its sequence with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov). 4,5 sars-cov-2 has a strong affinity for angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptors, which was an early indicator of its potential for becoming a pandemic threat. 6 the clinical characteristics of covid-19 have been well described, 1, [8] [9] [10] [11] but there are few published analyses focused specifically on covid-19 mortality. 12 in addition, there have been limited studies exploring the potential risk factors for covid-19 mortality. therefore, the present study examines potential risk factors for covid-19 mortality and aims to establish a covid-19 mortality risk prediction model at a single-center hospital.the authors obtained the medical records of 1,663 hospitalized patients with laboratoryconfirmed diagnosed covid-19 from tongji hospital between january 14, 2020, and february 28, 2020. as of march 26, the clinical outcomes of the total hospitalized patient population were collected. after exclusion of patients who were still hospitalized (n=196) or transferred to other hospitals (n=3), a total of 1,464 eligible patients were included in the final analysis. patients missing procalcitonin (pct; n=324) and lymphocyte count (ly; n=117) data were further excluded leaving 1,140 and 1,347 patients included in the analyses of pct and ly with covid-19 mortality, respectively. the study population selection is shown in appendix figure 1 .a laboratory-confirmed case of covid-19 was defined as a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) test result assay obtained through oral pharyngeal swab specimens. investigators collected demographic information, exposure history, medical history, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, chest computed tomography, laboratory findings on admission, and clinical outcomes from electronic medical records. laboratory results (blood count, chemical analysis, and coagulation testing) were included in laboratory testing.the date of disease onset, sars-cov-2 laboratory confirmation, hospital admission, discharge, and death were also recorded. the study was approved by tongji hospital ethics committee.oral pharyngeal swab samples (stored in 5-ml virus preservation solution) were collected for sars-cov-2 viral nucleic acid detection. virus rna was extracted within 24 hours by tianlong pana9600 automatic nucleic acid extraction system (tianlong, china referring to previous studies, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] age (<65 years, ≥65 years), sex (female, male), history of hypertension (yes/no) and diabetes (yes/no), lymphopenia (<1.1×10 9 /l, ≥1.1×10 9 /l), increased alanine aminotransferase (<40 u/l, ≥41 u/l), increased lactate dehydrogenase (<214 u/l, ≥214 u/l), increased d-dimer (<0.5 mg/l, ≥0.5 mg/l), and increased pct (<0.05 ng/ml, ≥0.05 ng/ml) were included in multivariable logistic regression model. in the analysis of pct and ly with covid-19 mortality, pct and ly were categorized into three groups according to the tertile of distribution. the p-value for trend was calculated from group medians. the association of pct concentration with risk of covid-19 mortality was also evaluated using restricted cubic splines, with 3 konts defined at the 5th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the pct concentrations; the reference value (or=1) was 0.05 ng/ml for pct concentrations; data from the <5th and >95th percentiles were deleted. variables that were at a statistically significant level (p<0.05) in the multivariable logistic regression were included in the prediction model. the receiver operating characteristic curve was used for prediction of covid-19 mortality, and the youden index was used to identify the optimal cut off point. 17 the novel scoring model was established, and the mortality risk scores were determined by multivariate logistic regression to reflect their weights of impact on the covid-19 mortality. the mortality risk score was calculated according to the ors and rounded to the nearest integer. 18 the total risk score was the sum of the scores of each variable (age, sex, history of diabetes, lymphopenia, and increased pct). spss version, 13.0 and sas, version 9.4 were used to conduct all statistical analyses. all analyses were conducted in april 2020. two-sided statistical tests were considered significant at p<0.05.baseline characteristics of the recovered patients (n=1,252) and patients who died from covid-19 (n=212) are shown in table 1 compared with recovered patients, those who died from covid-19 were more likely to be male, older, and tended to have a shorter time from onset of symptoms to death and shorter time of hospital stay (all p<0.01). in addition, patients who died from covid-19 had a higher proportion of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease (all p<0.01) and the presence of clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue (all p<0.01).more than 50% of patients had decreased ly (50.5%), and increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (75.8%), increased c-reactive protein (79.9%), and increased d-dimer (62.9%).increased pct (49%), mononucleosis (26.2%), increased alanine aminotransferase (20.3%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (19.9%) were observed. additionally, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased creatinine, increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased d-dimer, prolonged thrombin time, and increased pct were significantly different between recovered patients and those who died from covid-19 (all p<0.05). table 2 table 1 ). further adjustment for lymphopenia, increased alanine aminotransferase, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and increased d-dimer did not substantially change the association. a 1-sd (sd=0.6 ng/ml) increase in pct concentration was associated with a 3.91-fold increased risk of covid-19 mortality after adjustment for potential confounders (or=3.91, 95% ci=2.22, 6.91).further, spline regression analysis indicated that the association between pct concentrations and covid-19 mortality was nonlinear (p=0.0004 for nonlinearity) (appendix figure 2 ).the association of ly levels with risk of covid-19 mortality is presented in appendix table 1 table 1 ). after further adjustment for increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased creatinine, increased d-dimer, and increased pct, ly t1 had marginally higher risk of covid-19 mortality, when compared with t3 (or=1.64, 95% ci=0.95, 2.84; p=0.08 for trend) (appendix table 1 ). a 1-sd (sd=0.52 ×10 9 /l) decrease in ly concentration was associated with a 31% increased risk of covid-19 mortality after adjustment for potential confounders (or=1.31, 95% ci=1.03, 1.67) (appendix table 1 ). the categorical variable model for covid-19 mortality prediction is shown in table 3 . age (<65 years, ≥65 years), sex (female, male), history of diabetes (yes/no), and increased pct (<0.05 ng/ml, ≥0.05 ng/ml) were significantly associated with covid-19 mortality, and lymphopenia (<1.1×10 9 /l, ≥1.1×10 9 /l) had marginal association with covid-19 mortality. in order to more fully inform clinical utilization, the authors developed a novel scoring system for covid-19 mortality risk ( table 4 ). the optimal cut off point for covid-19 mortality risk was 3, and the area under the receiver operating curve of the covid-19 mortality risk score was 0.765 (95% ci=0.725, 0.805) (appendix figure 3 ).in this study of hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan, china conducted between mid-january to late march 2020, the authors found patients who were male, elderly (>65 years), and had a history of diabetes, lymphopenia, and increased pct tended to have higher odds of mortality. after further adjustment for potential confounders, significant independent associations were observed between older age, male sex, history of diabetes, lymphopenia, and increased pct and higher risk of covid-19 mortality.the age (median=64.0 years, iqr=51.0-71.0 years) of the overall population in the present study was higher than that of individuals in other studies, which might be related to the fact that more serious patients were admitted to tongji hospital. consistent with a previous study, 13 the current study found that increased age was positively correlated with risk of covid-19 mortality. prior studies report older age was an independent predictor of mortality in sars and mers. 19 ,20 a macaque model found that older macaques tended to have stronger host innate responses to sars-cov infection compared with younger macaque. 21 additionally, with increased age, t-cell and b-cell function become potentially more defective with overproduction of type 2 cytokines, which might be implicated in the poor clinical prognosis with covid-19 infection. 13, 22 these findings might help explain the relationship between older age and covid-19 mortality, as was observed in this and other studies.compared with female patients, male patients had higher odds of covid-19 mortality after adjustment for potential risk factors, which was inconsistent with the findings from another study based on 191 patients from two different hospitals. 13 this might due in part to difference in the size of the study sample and different sociodemographic composition of the study populations.however, other studies have also found that male patients tended to have higher risk of covid-19 mortality, 12,23 consistent with the present study. moreover, previous studies have reported that more men than women were affected by sars and mers infection. 19, 24 compared with men, women may tend to have healthier lifestyles and behaviors combined with gender differences in immune response, which might explain the potential mechanism behind this observed sex difference. 25 findings from the present study indicated that patients with a history of diabetes had higher odds of covid-19 mortality after adjustment for potential risk factors. previous studies found that the presence of diabetes increased morbidity and mortality in patients with covid-19, which was consistent with the present findings. 12, 26 in addition, a prior study found that plasma glucose levels and diabetes were independent predictors for mortality and morbidity in patients with sars. 27 patients with diabetes tended to have higher affinity cellular binding and efficient virus entry, decreased viral clearance, diminished t cell function, and increased susceptibility to hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm syndrome, which could all be contributing factors to greater susceptibility to covid-19 among diabetics and their generally poorer prognosis. 28 no studies have yet investigated whether pct is an independent risk factor for covid-19mortality. this study showed that pct concentrations were positively correlated with covid-19 mortality after adjustment for potential risk factors. although the inflammatory mediator pct is an established marker of bacterial infection and antibiotic stewardship, 29, 30 pct has been reported to be associated with clinical prognosis in myocardial infarction, cancer, sepsis patients, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 15, 16, 31 in addition, previous studies have found that a high pct concentration was an independent prognostic biomarker of mortality risk in both healthy populations and critically ill patients. 15, 16, 32 in sepsis, pct promotes inflammation and immunosuppression, and can play a dual role as a biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis as well as a disease mediator. 33 in vitro, liappis et al. 34 therefore, pct-increased covid-19 mortality might be implicated in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines although the exact mechanism behind this requires further investigation.previous studies have shown that deceased patients with covid-19 tended to have lower lymphocyte count, which is consistent with the findings of the present study. 12, 13 however, zhou and colleagues 13 did not find a significant association between lymphopenia and covid-19 mortality after adjustment for potential risk factors. different sample size of the study population and their sociodemographic composition again might explain some of these observed differences. the present study revealed that patients with lymphopenia had higher risk of covid-19 mortality whereas a prior study found the percentage of lymphocytes in the blood was negatively correlated with the severity and prognosis of covid-19. 36 sars-cov-2 might contribute to the destruction of lymphatic organs, cause lymphocytic dysfunction, induce apoptosis or necrosis of lymphocytes, and suppress lymphocytes via disordered metabolic molecules, which might work collectively to result in lymphopenia. 36 further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanism.the strengths of present study include the relatively large sample size, and the ability to investigate the associations between potential risk factors and covid-19 mortality with moderate statistical power. this study is the first that the authors are aware to report that male sex, increased pct levels, and lymphopenia are independent risk factors for covid-19 mortality. additionally, a novel scoring system was established to predict mortality risk in covid-19 patients in the present study.nonetheless, some limitations should be taken into consideration. first, the present study was performed in single medical center; thus, the findings may not be representative of the general population. second, the authors have not yet collected information on treatments in the present study. the mechanism between risk factors and covid-19 mortality still requires further study.this study of hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan, china, found many patients had at least one comorbidity with hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease as the most common pre-existing conditions. older age, male sex, history of diabetes, lymphopenia, and increased pct on admission had significant associations with covid-19 mortality. these independent risk factors can assist clinicians in identifying patients who are likely to have a poorer prognosis at an early stage in the clinical course of disease. in addition, the covid-19 mortality risk score model developed in this study is intended to help clinicians reduce the covid-19 related mortality by implementing better strategies for more effective use of limited medical resources.this work was supported by the grants from the hust covid-19 rapid response call (no.

disease 2019 (covid-19) is a current pandemic disease caused by the positive-sense rna virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). along with the highly infectious capacity of the virus, the mortality rates have been reported to range from 1% to >5%. 1 it has been reported that patients with covid-19 and hypertension may have an increased risk for adverse outcomes in unadjusted epidemiological studies summarizing the characteristics of the covid-19 epidemic in china. despite limited sample sizes, previous studies have reported that hypertension had a hazard ratio (hr) of 1.70 [95% confidence interval (ci) 0.92- 3.14 ] to 3 .05 (95% ci 1.57-5.92 ) for mortality, respectively. 2, 3 however, neither of these previous studies has adjusted for confounding factors, for example, age, which is emerging as the strongest predictor of covid-19-related death. 3, 4 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is required for viral entry of sars-cov-2. 5 ace2 is widely expressed in the human body, with expression found in the gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney, and alveolar cells in the lungs. 6, 7 angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (aceis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs) are the two types of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) inhibitors widely used for treating hypertension, and heart and renal failure. there are reports in animal models 8 and humans 9 suggesting that the expression of ace2 may be increased after treatment with an acei or arb (some reports incriminated only arbs 10 ), which might augment patients' susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. 11 although the effects of aceis or arbs on ace2 in humans are still inconclusive, previous findings have led to a growing concern that aceis or arbs may increase (or decrease) mortality in patients with covid- 19. 12,13 therefore, evidence of the impact of these medications in patients with covid-19 is urgently needed.here, we investigated 2877 consecutive patients admitted to huo shen shan hospital, which is a hospital dedicated solely to the treatment of covid-19, in wuhan, china. we tested the hypothesis that treatment of hypertension, especially with raas inhibitors, might impact on the mortality of patients with covid- 19 .this is a retrospective observational study comparing the association of both hypertensive status and antihypertensive treatment class with mortality among hospitalized patients with covid- 19 14, 15 in brief, clinical manifestations of covid-19 are defined as the development of fever and/or respiratory symptoms; computed tomography (ct) imaging showing characteristics consistent with covid-19; or normal or decreased white blood cell (wbc) count, and normal or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of the disease. patients with a suspicious epidemiological history (i.e. contact with novel coronavirus-infected people or patients from wuhan who have fever or respiratory symptoms) plus any two clinical manifestations or no clear epidemiological history but with all three clinical manifestations were considered as possible covid-19 case. patients who were considered as possible covid-19 cases, with or without laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection, were admitted to the huo shen shan hospital.the confirmation of sars-cov-2 infection was defined as suspect cases with one of the following serological findings; (i) real-time fluorescent reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) positive for new coronavirus nucleic acid; (ii) viral gene sequence highly homologous to known new coronaviruses; and (iii) sars-cov-2-specific igm or igg are detected in serum, or sars-cov-2-specific igg is detectable or reaches a titration of at least a four-fold increase during convalescence compared with the acute phase.this study was approved by the national health commission of china and the institutional review board at huo shen shan hospital (wuhan, china). written informed consent was waived by the ethics committee of the designated hospital for patients with emerging infectious diseases.patients' demographic characteristics and clinical data (symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and outcomes) during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records by two investigators (r.z. and y.c). all data were independently reviewed and entered into the computer database by two analysts (c.g. and y.c.).the primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. other endpoints included the time elapsed between onset of symptoms and discharge, the rates of use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and the severity of covid- 19 . the severity of covid-19 was categorized as mild, severe, or critical. mild included non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases. severe was characterized by dyspnoea, respiratory frequency > _30/min, blood oxygen saturation < _93%, pao 2 /fio 2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 h. critical cases were defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanic ventilation, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure. 1, 16 the final date of follow-up was 1 april 2020 and the median duration of follow-up (hospitalization) was 21 (12-32) days.the diagnosis of hypertension was given by the patient's physician prior to the infection with sars-cov-2. these data were collected from patients' documented medical files (e.g. the diagnosed patients with antihypertensive drugs and blood pressure <140/90 mmhg upon admission were still identified as 'with a history of hypertension'). there was no impact of antihypertensive treatments in covid-formal committee to adjudicate the status of hypertension; however, these diagnoses were rechecked by two individual investigators (r.z. and y.c) during data collection, using office systolic blood pressure > _140 mmhg and/or diastolic blood pressure values > _90 mmhg 17 as the criteria. figure 1 shows the flow chart of the study. the antihypertensive regimens were in principle unchanged during hospitalization whenever the patients had previous prescriptions before admission. discontinuation or alteration of the antihypertensive treatment during hospitalization was at the physician's discretion. those who required antihypertensive medication during hospitalization with no prior prescription, or those who had discontinued the medications prior to admission, were treated with calcium channel blockers (ccbs) or diuretics. the cohorts of 'without antihypertensive' and 'with antihypertensive treatments', as well as the cohorts of 'raas inhibitors' (acei/arbs) and 'non-raas inhibitors' (beta-blockers, ccbs, or diuretics) , were stratified at the time of their admission and according to their pre-admission medications. there were 15 patients (no death events) taking spirolactone but were categorized in the 'non-raas inhibitors' group in the analysis. patients were included in the raas inhibitor cohort whenever at least one raas inhibitor (an acei or arb) was prescribed, disregarding whether or not they were treated with a beta-blocker, ccb, or diuretics. nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis was performed by including patients who were treated solely with one medication (supplementary material online, table s3 ).continuous variables with normal distribution are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (sd), and those with skewed distribution are expressed as median ± interquartile range (iqr). categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages. means of two continuous variables were compared by independent student's t-test or mann-whitney u-test when appropriate. the frequencies of categorical variables were compared using fisher's exact test. survival was estimated by the kaplan-meier method ( figure 2 ). the variances in outcomes between exposure cohorts were assessed by the multivariable cox proportional hazards model. the covariates in the multivariable model included age (as a continuous variable), sex, medical history of diabetes, insulin-treated diabetes, myocardial infarction, treatment by percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) or coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg), renal failure, chronic heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive coronary disease (copd), and stroke (as binary variables). cox proportionality assumptions were checked by using the schoenfeld residuals against the transformed time, and the assumptions were met in all models. there was no formal correction for multiple testing, taking into account the observational nature of the analysis. 18 the details of statistical approaches for the meta-analysis are provided in supplementary material online, methods. analyses were performed using the r-project (r foundation, vienna, austria). a two-sided p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.in total, 2877 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed covid-19 were enrolled in the study. the median time from symptom onset to discharge (last follow-up) was 39 (30-50) days. baseline characteristics are presented in table 1 . the results of the laboratory tests are presented in the supplementary material online, tables s6-s8 . among these patients, 29 .5% (850/2877) had a medical history of hypertension. when compared with patients without hypertension, those with hypertension were older, more often had a prior history of diabetes, angina, stroke, renal failure, or previous revascularization (pci or cabg), and were receiving more medication for diabetes and hypertension. the spectrum of symptoms of covid-19 at admission between the two cohorts did not differ significantly. there were 710/850 (83.5%) patients with hypertension taking antihypertensive medications. the medical history, symptoms onset, and blood pressure at admission did not differ significantly between patients with no antihypertensive medications and those with medications, except that patients with antihypertensive medications were treated more often with oral medication for diabetes. there were 183 (25.7%) patients treated with raas inhibitors and 527 (74.2%) treated with beta-blockers, ccbs, or diuretics (non-raas inhibitors) (supplementary material online, table s1 ). the medical history and blood pressure at admission did not differ significantly between the raas inhibitor-treated [raasi (þ)] and non-raas inhibitor-treated patients [raasi (-)]. there were 14 patients who reported shivering at admission in the raasi (-) cohort, compared with none in the raasi (þ) cohort ( table 1) .a total of 34/850 (4.0%) patients died in the hypertension cohort and 22/2027 (1.1%) died in the no hypertension cohort (crude hr 3.75, 95% ci 2.19-6.41, p < 0.001; figure 1a ). after adjustment for confounders, hypertension was still associated with a two-fold increase in the risk of mortality as compared with no hypertension (adjusted hr 2.12, 95% ci 1.17-3.82, p = 0.013; table 2 ). the time from symptom onset to discharge was comparable between the two cohorts; however, patients with hypertension had the propensity to develop more severe/critical covid-19 disease (p for trend < 0.001) and were more likely to receive invasive mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001) ( table 3) .for the patients with hypertension, those without antihypertensive treatment (11/140) had a significantly higher rate of mortality compared with those with antihypertensive (23/710) treatments (7.9% vs. 3 .2%, hr 2.52, 95% ci 1. 23-5.17 , p = 0.012; figure 1b ; table 2 ). after adjustment, the risk of mortality was still higher in patients without antihypertensive treatment (hr 2.17, 95% ci 1.03-4.57, p = 0.041).there were 183 (25.7%) patients treated with raas inhibitors and 527 (74.2%) with beta-blockers, ccbs, or diuretics (non-raas inhibitors). the numerical difference in rates of mortality between the raas inhibitor and non-raas inhibitor cohorts were nonsignificant before or after adjustment (2.2% vs. 3 .6%, adjusted hr 0.85, 95% ci 0.28-2.58, p = 0.774). the time from symptom onset to discharge, the severity of the covid-19, and percentage of ventilation were all similar between the two cohorts.to understand whether aceis and arbs had distinct effects on outcomes, we have also compared the influence of aceis and arbs with those of non-raas inhibitors. compared with non-raas inhibitors, the risks of mortality in patients with arbs or aceis were both numerically lower. since the sample size was small in both groups, any results could be largely due to play of chance; however, these results did not show an obvious propensity that arbs and aceis had an adverse hr (>1) as far as the mortality is concerned (supplementary material online, table s2 ).to further explore the potential risk factors for mortality, we performed a multivariable cox regression analysis with backwardsstepwise selection to identify the predictors of mortality. a total of seven variables were identified, namely fatigue, age, hypertension, myocardial infarction, renal failure, respiratory rate, and chronic heart failure. these results are shown in the supplementary material online, tables s4 and s5; figure s1 .most recently, there are three other groups in china who have reported their data regarding the influence of raas inhibitors in covid-19 patients. we have summarized all the available data in a meta-analysis. [19] [20] [21] together with our current data, we found that compared with non-raas inhibitors, raas inhibitors were associated with a lower risk of mortality (relative risk 0.65; 95% ci, 0.45-0.94, p = 0.02), regardless of the model used.the main findings of this analysis can be summarized as follows: (i) after adjustment for confounders and compared with the nonhypertensive patients, the hypertensive patients continued to demonstrate a two-fold relative increase in the risk of covid-19 mortality; (ii) the patients with a history of hypertension but without antihypertensive treatment were associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with those with antihypertensive treatments; and (iii) the relative rates of mortality, the severity of covid-19, and percentages of ventilation were not statistically different between the patients treated with raas inhibitors and non-raas inhibitors. however, in the meta-analysis, raas inhibitors tend to be associated with a lower risk of mortality.patients with covid-19 and hypertension have been reported to have an increased risk of adverse outcomes. chen et al. suggested that chronic hypertension was more frequent among patients who died compared with recovered patients. 22 in line with this finding, wu et al. found that hypertension has an hr of 1.70 for death in 201 patients with covid-19, 2 and zhou et al. found hypertension had an hr of 3.05 for in-hospital mortality in 191 patients with covid- 19. 3 meanwhile, there was also a study which enrolled 416 patients which suggested that after the adjustment for confounders, hypertension was no longer an independent risk factor for covid- 19. 23 in the current study, we found that after adjustment for confounders, patients with hypertension still had a significantly two-fold higher risk of mortality when compared with patients with no hypertension.so far, there is limited clinical evidence demonstrating that antihypertensive treatments could influence the prognosis of covid- 19. despite the lack of evidence, the council on hypertension of the european society of cardiology (esc) recommends that physicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual antihypertensive therapy. 24 our analysis showed that patients with antihypertensive treatments pre-admission had a lower rate of mortality compared with those without treatment of hypertension. these data support esc's recommendation stating that patients should not discontinue or change their antihypertensive treatment, unless instructed by a physician.recently ace2 has been identified to be necessary for viral entry for sars-cov-2. as ace generates angiotensin ii from angiotensin i, ace2 degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin (1-7), which, after binding to the mas receptor, shifts the balance from vasoconstriction with angiotensin ii to vasodilation. under normal circumstances, the circulating levels of soluble ace2 are low and the functional role of ace2 in the lungs appears to be relatively limited, 25 but may be upregulated with certain medications or clinical states. this has led to a two-fold concern whereby aceis and arbs might affect the severity and mortality of covid- 19. 12,13 one is that aceis could directly inhibit ace2. however, despite substantial structural homology between ace and ace2, their enzyme active sites are distinct. as a result, aceis in clinical use do not directly affect ace2 functions. 26 in addition, there is the concern that the use of aceis and arbs will increase the expression of ace2 8 and therefore increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. conflicting and limited evidence stemming from laboratory or clinical studies has shown changes in serum or pulmonary ace2 levels in response to aceis or arbs. 12 however, even if an acei or arb could actually modify ace2 levels or activity (or both) in target tissue beds, evidence is still lacking to indicate whether this would facilitate greater involvement of spike protein and cell entry of sars-cov-2.given the uncertainty due to lack of clinical data, there are both advocates and objectors toward the use of raas inhibitors during the covid-19 pandemic. in our study, we found that the risks of mortality after adjustment were not significantly different between raas inhibitors and non-raas inhibitors. furthermore, after pooling with previously published data [19] [20] [21] in a study-level meta-analysis, we found that patients with raas inhibitor use were possibly associated with a lower risk of mortality (take home figure) .the underlying mechanism of why patients could eventually benefit from raas inhibitors during covid-19 is putative. however, results from laboratory studies reported that after the initial engagement of sars-cov-1 spike protein, ace2 abundance was downregulated on cell surfaces. 27 the down-regulation of ace2 and the dysregulation of its activity in the lungs may facilitate the initial neutrophil infiltration in response to bacterial endotoxin and may result in unopposed angiotensin ii accumulation and local raas activation. 28 an animal study has also shown that in mouse models, exposure to sars-cov-1 spike protein induced acute lung injury, which is limited by raas blockade. 27 therefore, some researchers have hypothesized that high ace2 expression could be deleterious during the contamination phase, whereas the high ace2 expression could, in contrast, be beneficial during the inflammation phase 27 and may possibly prevent organ injury in covid- 19. 29,30 to further verify our results, as well as this hypothesis, we have also designed a randomized controlled trial, which is ongoing, investigating this issue (nct04330300).as described above, these data showed that untreated hypertensive patients are at the highest risk. there are remaining questions: (i) which kind of medication should be given to those patients (ccbs or raas inhibitors); (ii) could such medications mitigate the risk of these patients; and (iii) will the use of raas inhibitors affect the risk of infection when equally exposed to the virus? limitations i. the multivariable-adjusted cox proportional hazard models were performed in an attempt to estimate the true treatment effects of antihypertensive medications. however, the usual deficiency of observational studies exists, such as the inability to include all relevant confounders, especially those unmeasured, causing bias that cannot be adjusted. ii. although the current study enrolled 2877 patients, to our knowledge so far one of the largest cohorts reported, only 183 patients with raas inhibitors and 527 patients with non-raas inhibitors were compared. statistically underpowered, our findings should be interpreted cautiously. iii. as a retrospective study, some data such as electrocardiogram and echocardiography were not recorded in detail in the study owing to the limitations imposed in the isolation ward and the urgency of containing the covid-19 epidemic. iv. the data in this study permit a short-term assessment of the clinical outcomes of the impact of antihypertensive treatments. long-term prospective studies investigating the effects of these treatments are still needed.while hypertension is independently associated with mortality from covid-19, the discontinuation of the antihypertensive treatment is suspected to be associated with an increased risk of mortality. patients with raas inhibitors were not exposed to a higher risk of mortality in our study and, after pooling previously published data in a study-level meta-analysis, the use of raas inhibitors was shown to be possibly associated with lower risk of mortality. nevertheless, due to the observational nature of the study, the results should be interpreted cautiously and considered as no obvious additional risk to continue raas inhibitors in patients with covid-19 infection.since december 2019, a cluster of pneumonia have attacked all human beings [1] .the pathogen was designated as sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses, and this pneumonia was named as coronavirus disease2019 by world health organization (who) [2] . nowadays, there were more than one million confirmed cases and over 100000 deaths occurred in 208 countries/territories according to the report of who until april 12 th , 2020. the rapidly increasing of patients, especially the critical or mortal patients, brought a big challenge to the public health. lai [3] et al. found that mortality was correlated with country health care resources. however, in many countries, the invasive ventilator and intensive care unit (icu) were far from adequate for the treatment of critical patients.clinical workers should pay attention to the risk factors of covid-19 critical disease and death, identify critical patients early, allocate medical resources rationally and timely adjust the treatment plan to enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of death.in this article, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with critical/mortal illness and non-critical illness in 13 literatures with 3027 patients, to identify the risk factors for covid-19 patients to develop critical disease or death, in order to effectively predict the progression of the disease, make early treatment response and allocate medical resources in a better way.this systematic review and meta-analysis is reported in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses( prisma)statement.we selected relevant studies published between jan 1, 2020 and mar 20, 2020, by data extraction and the evaluation of literature quality were conducted independently by 2 investigators (z.z.h&t.w.l). microsoft excel database was used to record all available information, including baseline details, comorbidities, clinical manifestations. any disagreement was resolved by another investigator (p.f). the minors [4] was used to assess bias risk.all analyses were performed using microsoft excel, state software version 15.0 and revman software version 5.3. the results of the included studies were performed with fixed-effect models (mantel-haenszel method) or random-effect models in cases of significant heterogeneity between studies. we used the i 2 statistics to assess the magnitude of heterogeneity: 25%, 50%, and 75% represented low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively. the chosen of the proper effect model was based on the analysis results: the fixed effect model was used if i 2 ≤ 50% and the random effect model was used if i 2 ＞50%. if there was statistical heterogeneity among the results, a further sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the source of heterogeneity. after the significant clinical heterogeneity was excluded, the randomized effects model was used for meta-analysis. p < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.based on the previous search strategy, 523 studies were searched from the online database. after deleting duplicate records, a total of 343 records were retained. then, 311 articles were excluded by the titles and abstracts, and 19 of the remaining 32 articles were deleted for various reasons. the last 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis. finally, a total of 13 studies with 3027 patients were included [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] (   figure 1 ).all of the selected studies were published in 2020 with different sample patient sizes that ranged from 27 to 1099 patients. clinical outcome was defined as icu admission in 3 studies [6, 8, 12] , refractory in 1 study [7] , severity in 2 studies [9.11] , sp0 2 ＜ 90%in 1 study [13] , onset of ards in 1 study [14] and death in the remaining investigation [5, 10, [15] [16] [17] . the risk of bias and applicability concerns included studies are showed in table 1 . over all, none of the studies was considered to be seriously flawed according to the minors assessment. the 13 included studies scored between 18 and 21. all studies were considered to have a low risk of bias for selection.the demographical characteristics of the included studies are shown in table   2 .the results from the 13 included studies (with a total amount of 3027 patients) showed that the proportion of male was significant higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group [male: or = 1.77, 95% ci (1.43, 2.19) , p < 0.00001]( figure 2 ).the median ages ranged from 49 to 70.5 years old in the critical/mortal group across the enrolled studies. the median ages ranged from 37 to 62 years old in the non-critical group(table1). the median ages were generally higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group. furthermore, age over 65 years was analyzed as a subgroup by guan [8] and tian [11] (with a total amount of 1273 patients).meta-analysis showed that the proportion of patients older than 65 years was higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group. [age over 65 years old: or = 6.01, 95% ci (3.95, 9.16) , p < 0.00001]( figure 2 ).five studies showed that the proportion of current smoker was statistically significant higher in critical/mortal group compared to the non-critical group [current smoking: or = 2.04, 95% ci (1.32, 3.15), p = 0.0006]( figure 2 ).there was no heterogeneity in the estimates of male, age over 65 years old and current smoking among the identified studies with i 2 = 0.the comorbidities of patients of the included studies are shown in table 3 . we then compared the difference of the prevalence of the comorbidities between critical/mortal patients and non-critical patients. for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, the heterogeneity test results were calculated as i 2 = 45%, 37% and 50%. thus, the fixed-effect model was used for further analyses. the proportion of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease was statistically significant higher in critical/mortal group compared to the non-critical group [diabetes:0r = 3.68, 95% ci (2.68, 5.03), p < 0.00001;cardiovascular disease: or = 5.19, 95% ci (3.25, 8.29) , p < 0.00001; respiratory disease: or = 5.15, 95% ci (2.51, 10.57), p < 0.00001]( figure 3 ). for hypertension, the heterogeneity test showed that i 2 = 72%. given that the severity of illness and severity of epidemic might contribute to the heterogeneity, we classified the studies into two subgroups according to whether the study site was located in wuhan. however, heterogeneity still exists. so the random effect model was used. the result indicated a higher proportion of hypertension in critical/mortal group[or = 2.72, 95% ci (1.60,4.64), p = 0.0002] (figure 3 ).for malignancy, the fixed-effect model(i 2 = 0) meta-analysis showed that the proportion of malignancy was higher in critical/death group yet without statistical significance[or = 1.60, 95% ci (0.81, 3.18), p = 0.18] (figure 3 ).the study of clinical manifestation included 13 studies, a total of 3025 cases. the clinical features are showed in table 4 and the results of meta-analysis are showed in table 5 . for fever (temperature ≥ 37.3°c), the proportion of fever was statistically the laboratory examination of the included studies(4 studies, a total of 1286 cases) are shown in table 6 . for "wbc < 4x10 9 per l", the analysis results of the fixed effect-model(i 2 = 0)showed that the proportion of "wbc < 4x10 9 per l" was statistically lower in critical/mortal group[0r = 0.30, 95% ci (0.17, 0.51), p < 0.00001](figure4). for "ast > 40u/l" , "cr ≥ 133μmol/l" and "hs-ctni > 28 pg/ml", the heterogeneity test results were calculated as i 2 = 0%, 0% and 34%. we used the fixed-effect model for further analyses. the proportion of "ast > 40u/l", "cr ≥ 133μmol/l" and "hs-ctni > 28 pg/ml" was statistically significant higher in critical/death group compared to the non-critical group ["ast > 40u/l":0r = 4.00, 95% ci (2.46, 6.52), p < 0.00001;"cr ≥ 133μmol/l":0r = 5.30, 95% ci (2.19, 12.83) , p = 0.0002; "hs-ctni > 28 pg/ml":0r = 43.24, 95% ci (9.92, 188.49), p < 0.00001] ( figure 5 ).the i 2 value of "pct > 0.5 ng/ml", "ldh > 245u/l" and "d-dimer > 0.5mg/l" was, respectively, 52%, 59% and 72%. so the random effect model was the results of meta-analysis showed that male, aged over 65 and smoking patients might face a greater risk of developing into the critical or mortal condition and the comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease or respiratory diseases could also greatly affect the prognosis of the covid-19. we found that patients with shortness of breath/dyspnea were more likely to develop into critical illness or even die, but patients with fever progressed better than those without fever. laboratory examinations such as wbc, ast, cr, hs-ctni, pct, ldh and d-dimer could imply the progression of covid-19.coronavirus is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded rna virus [18] . at present, six human coronaviruses have been identified. and the sars-cov-2, which isolated from the lower respiratory tract of pneumonia patients with unknown causes in wuhan, is identified as the seventh human coronaviruses [19] . sars-cov-2 attacks the alveolar epithelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2). ace2 is the ace of isozyme, mainly distributed in cardiovascular, kidneys, testes, lung and colon, and other organizations [20] . the main role of ace2 is to incise ang ii to generate ang 1-7, which mediates the protective effects of vasodilation, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferation, to antagonize ang ii-induced vascular smooth muscle contraction, cell proliferation, fibrosis promotion and vascular inflammation [21] [22] [23] . when sars-cov-2 binds to ace2 receptor on the surface of alveolar epithelial cells, the expression of ace2 in alveolar epithelial cells is down-regulated by mechanisms such as internalization, shedding and viral replication [24] . then the increased concentration of ang ii leads to inflammatory response, and exudation of neutrophils, macrophages and fibrinous, resulting in loss of pulmonary ventilation function and difficulty in maintaining oxygenation [25] . at the same time, viral infection will cause the imbalance of t helper-1 and t helper-2 responses, and induce an inflammatory storm by increasing the levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-4, interleukin-10 and interleukin-6 [26] . inflammatory storm in critical patients releases cytokines, causing systemic immune injury, which may be an important cause of multiple organ failure and even death [27] .studies have found that women are less susceptible to viral infection than men, possibly because of the protection of x chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity [28] . at the same time, men tend to be associated with bad lifestyle habits such as smoking and underlying diseases. as a result, the majority of critical or mortal patients are male. as the body's immunity declines with age, elderly patients are more likely to develop critical illness or even die. therefore, when the patient is male, over 65 years old and smoking, the patient has a higher risk of developing critical illness or death.when patients are combined with basic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, the body is in a state of stress for a long time and the immunity tends to be low. moreover, the long-term history of diabetes and hypertension will damage the vascular structure, and it is more likely to develop into critical disease in infection.patients with chronic heart disease are more likely to be infected due to their weakened heart function and low immunity. when infected with sars-cov-2, they are more likely to have acute cardiovascular events and develop into severe diseases.when the patient has previous respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient's lung function is damaged. they have lower resistance to the virus and are prone to developing ards. thus, underlying diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease are risk factors for disease progression. this is consistent with the analytical results in this paper.the common clinical manifestations of covid-19 patients are fever, cough and sputum [6] . when the patient's immune response is low, it may manifest as normal body temperature. shortness of breath or dyspnea suggests poor lung function and lacking of oxygen. therefore, when the patient is found to have difficulty in breathing or no fever, it is necessary to be alert for further deterioration of the patient's condition.viral infection will cause inflammation in human body. various inflammatory factors produced by the inflammatory storm can cause systemic immune damage and even cause multi-organ failure. when the patient's laboratory indicator shows pct > 0.5 ng/ml, there is a higher risk of progression to critical illness. study showed that the total number of wbc in the early stage of the disease is normal or reduced [6] .however, wbc < 4x10 9 /l means a better clinical outcome in this paper. therefore, when the total number of wbc is found to be higher than the previous one, the patient may be associated with other infections that aggravated the disease. at this moment, the clinicians might pay more attentions to these patients and improve treatment.when ast > 40u/l, ldh > 245u/l and cr ≥ 133 mol/l, it indicates that the liver and kidney dysfunctions have been involved, and corresponding treatments should be taken in time to prevent further deterioration of the disease. current studies have shown that up to 20% of covid-19 patients have abnormal coagulation function [6] .monocytes and tissue cells are activated after injury, causing the release of cytokines and the expression of tissue factors, and finally causing the hypercoagulability of blood. it will increase the risk of thrombosis and more likely to cause ischemia and hypoxia due to the embolization of the viscera, which leads to the progression of the disease to critical disease or death. when the d-dimer > 0.5mg/l, it indicates the hypercoagulability of blood and suggests the deterioration of patients. at the same time, sars-cov-2 can cause myocardial injury by direct and/or indirect action. the direct injury is to infect cardiomyocytes by identifying ace2 receptor, while the indirect injury may be caused by inflammatory storm inducing by immune response and/or oxygen supply imbalance inducing by acute respiratory distress syndrome.when hs-ctni > 28pg/ml, it strongly suggests the possibility of further deterioration of the patient's condition.the quality of the literature included in this study is high, the analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions drawn by the study are highly credible. however, this meta-analysis also has some limitations: (a) most of the studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional studies with insufficient demonstration ability. (b) most of the patients in our meta-analysis were chinese, and our aim was to use the findings of this study to predict the overall profile of patients, including other countries and races; (c) more detailed patient information, such as iconograph and oxygen at ion index, was not available in most studies at the time of analysis. the conclusions of this meta-analysis still need to be verified by more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.this study analyzed the risk factors for progression to critical illness or death in covid-19 patients to help assessing patient status and identify critical patients early.pay close attention to these risk factors, and when relevant laboratory risk value appears, timely and personalized treatment regimens are needed to enhance the efficacy and reduce the risk of death. fig. 1 flow diagram of the study selection process table 1 minors rating scale:①a clearly stated aim;②inclusion of consecutive patients; ③prospective collection of data;④ endpoints appropriate to the aim of the study;⑤unbiased assessment of the study endpoint;⑥follow-up period appropriate to the aim of the study;⑦loss to follow up less than 5%;⑧ prospective calculation of the study size.⑨appropriate selection of control group;⑩synchronization of control group; ⑪baseline comparable between groups ⑫appropriately statistical analysis. the global ideal score being 24 for comparative studies.huang c heterogeneity analysis was carried out using q test, the among studies variation (i 2 index). forest plots depict the comparison of the incidences of male, age＞65 years old and current smoking in critical/mortal and non-critical patients. figure 4 : meta-analysis for laboratory examination in covid-19 cases. fix-effect model for "wbc < 4x10 9 per l" "ast > 40u/l" "cr ≥ 133μmol/l" and "hs-ctni > 28 pg/ml". random-effect model for "pct > 0.5 ng/ml" "ldh > 245u/l" and "d-dimer > 0.5mg/l". heterogeneity analysis was carried out using q test, the among studies variation (i 2 index). forest plots depict the comparison of the incidences of the laboratory examination in critical/mortal and non-critical patientssevere and critical disease was defined according to 7th version of the guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 issued by the national health commission of china as follows: (a) severe disease, met anyone of the following criteria: shortness of breath, respiratory rate (rr) ≥30 times/min; finger pulse oxygen saturation ≤93% in resting state; arterial partial oxygen pressure (pao 2 )/oxygen absorption concentration (fio 2 ) ≤300 mm hg (1 mm hg = 0.133 kpa); pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions progressed more than 50% within 24-48 hours. (b) critical disease, met anyone of the following conditions: respiratory failure and need mechanical ventilation; shock; and other organ failure requiring icu monitoring and treatment.clinical data of severe and critical covid-19 patients were re- and (d) the nucleic acid test of respiratory samples such as sputum and nasopharynx swab was negative twice in a row (the sampling time interval was at least 24 hours).the continuous variable of normal distribution was represented as mean ± standard deviation (sd), while the continuous variable of non-normal distribution was represented by median (interquartile range [iqr]). the categorical variable was displayed as count (percentage). the chi-square test was used to compare the mortality rate between or among groups. spss 25.0 statistical software (ibm) was used for the statistical analysis. p < .05 was considers as significant. table 2 . table 3 . table 4 .a total of 50 (31.06%) patients died, while 78 (48.45%) patients healed and discharged, and the last 33 (20.50%) patients remained in hospital (table 5) the mortality rate was 24.13%, 34.69%, 36.00%, and 24.24% in patients aged ≤44 years, patients aged 45-59 years, patients aged 60-74 years, and patients aged ≥75 years, respectively; further comparison analysis revealed that no difference was found among these four group patients (p = .525) (figure 1) . notably, ards (p < .001) and mods (p = .008) correlated with increased mortality rate, while electrolyte disorders (p = .249) and hypoproteinemia (p = .248) did not associated with mortality risk (figure 2 ).in meanwhile, an earlier study focusing chinese covid-19 patients observes their median age is around 41 years. 4 our study disclosed that the mean age of severe and critical covid-19 patients was 59.38 years, indicating the severe and critical disease is more popular in aged population, which might result from that the elders had poor immunity and increased basic diseases. in terms of gender, we found that the proportion of men was about twice as that of women in severe and critical covid-19 patients, which might be due to the men were more commonly outside and in public place instead of women in severe and critical covid-19 patients, and the complications such as lung diseases were also more common in men. so as to medical history, we observed that hypertension and diabetes were most common in severe and critical covid-19 patients, which was in line with the conditions of mers. 5 with regard to the clinical symptoms of severe and critical covid-19 patients on admission, we observed that fever and dry f i g u r e 1 mortality rate among different age-subgroups f i g u r e 2 correlation of common complications post-admission with mortality rate. ards, acute respiratory distress syndrome; mods, multiple organ dysfunction cough were the most common symptoms, which were in accordance with findings in previous studies of covid-19, 6 and were similar to patients with mers-cov and sars coronavirus infection. 7, 8 in terms of laboratory indexes, we discovered that blood routine indexes, hepatic and renal function indexes, and inflammation indexes were commonly abnormal in severe and critical covid-19 patients, these might be account of that (a) covid-19 mainly acted on lymphocytes, especially t lymphocytes, which was similar to sars-cov 9 and mers-cov, 10 patients, and therefore, it was essential to timely monitor and prevent ards and mods potency. however, electrolyte disorders and hypoproteinemia were not associated with prognosis, but the latter was previously reported to be independent risk factor for severe mers-cov infection 14 and serum albumin could reflect nutritional status therefore related to severe and critical covid-19.in aspect of treatment regimen, all the treatment procedures were set according to the guidelines and accumulating clinical experience, based on antiviral drugs and other supported treatments.and among the antiviral drugs, the most commonly used was lopinavir and ritonavir tablets.the clinical outcome of covid-19 patients is an essential issue to be explored. according to a previous meta-analysis, the mortality rate of covid-19 patients ranges from 2.0% to 4.4%. 15 meanwhile, the severe covid-19 patients present with a higher mortality rate of 8.1%, but at the time of this study disclosed, 89.0% patients were still in hospitalization, and therefore, the mortality rate might be greatly underestimated. 16 as to outcome of critical-ill covid-19 patients, seldom report is disclosed. in this study, we found that the mortality rate was as high as 31.06% in severe and critical covid-19 patients, which was higher than previous studies. these might be to be: (a) the longer follow-up duration of our study and (b) critical-ill patients were also included in our study. furthermore, the previous study reveals that the mortality rate of severe mers is around 43.75%, 5 which is higher compared to severe and critical covid-19 patients in our study. as to healed and discharged rate, 48.45% severe and critical covid-19 patients realized it, which was acceptable. notably, we observed that a small proportion of patients who were discharged in accordance with the current discharge standard were tested positive for the new type of coronavirus nucleic acid again within 14 days of isolation and returned to hospital for treatment. therefore, we suggested at least three consecutive negative tests were a necessity for discharge.some limitations existed in this study: firstly, since this was a retrospective study, potential bias and residual confounding might exist; secondly, all the patients were retrieved from icu database, and therefore, these patients might not represent all general severe and critical covid-19 patients; thirdly, there were still a proportion of patients in hospitalization, and therefore, the mortality rate and discharged rate might be influenced.in summary, severe and critical covid-19 presents with high mortality rate, and occurrence of ards or mods greatly increases its mortality risk. therefore, it is essential for early intervention to prevent mild/moderate covid-19 from progressing to severe and critical covid-19, and early prevention of ards and mods is also important, as so to improve the prognosis of covid-19.yiping yin https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2288-4260s ince the beginning of this year 2020, several studies regarding the epidemiological, physiopathological, and clinical aspects of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) have been published in rapid manner. this has greatly contributed to a fast understanding of this novel disease, and rapidly helped physicians, and relatedhealth care workers and policy makers for a better comprehension of covid-19. this novel disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). to date may 5, 2020, this disease has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide with 3,679,499 laboratory-confirmed cases and 254,199 deaths. there is increasing evidence of higher mortality risk associated to the presence of cardiovascular involvement in patients with covid-19. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 appears to be easily transmittable, more contagious, with greater infectivity, and somehow similar or higher morbidity and mortality depending on the area considered, as compared with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers). [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] until now, there has been a rapidly increasing incidence of patients with sars-cov-2 who have developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular compromise, or multiple organ failure and death. cardiovascular diseases (cvd) are still the number one killer in the world, and represent the leading noncommunicable epidemic. since numerous patients with cvd are using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (acei) or angiotensin receptor blockade (arb) drug agents, clinical studies may be necessary to explore the potential associations of these pharmacological drugs with the susceptibility and prognosis of covid-19. despite the theoretical concerns and physiological uncertainties concerning the effect of ace inhibitors and arb on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), ace inhibitors and arb should be continued in patients with covid-19 in otherwise stable condition. this is a position supported by multiple medical and scientific societies that needs to be further explored by randomized clinical trials to search for the potential associations of these pharmacological drugs with the susceptibility and prognosis of covid- 19 .the exact mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with covid-19 still remains uncertain. however, different possible mechanisms manifested in recent studies can be elaborated. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] nonischemic events and ischemic myocardial involvement are the 2 main pathophysiological mechanisms of acute cardiac injury in covid-19 patients. 3 it is believed that nonischemic myocardial injury is predominant and is secondary to multiple mechanisms that will be analyzed in this article. huang et al 1 reported recently that 12% of patients had covid-19-associated acute cardiac injury manifesting as myocardial inflammation with troponin i (tni) elevation and decreased left ventricular systolic function. wang et al 2 recently reported their findings on 138 patients hospitalized with covid-19. they found that 7% of their patients developed acute cardiac injury, and those patients in the intensive care unit were more likely to have cardiac alterations (22%) than those non-icu patients. cardiac arrhythmias were seen in 17%. patient with known coronary artery disease and heart failure patients were at higher risk than others. there was higher mortality when covid-19 was associated with acute myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and rapid-onset heart failure. 1 this observation clearly suggests that cardiovascular involvement and especially cardiac injury is possibly associated with the morbid clinical outcomes of covid-19.therefore, to assess the potential mechanisms of cardiac injury and its association with inflammation in covid-19 patients, we aim to analyze the effect of different serum biomarkers of inflammation and cardiac involvement on the incidence of clinical outcomes and mortality to delineate their importance in guiding the therapeutic management for better cardiovascular outcome especially in hospitalized patients with covid-19.we conducted an electronic search of pubmed, medline, web of science, and scopus to identify journal articles published in english from december 2019 to april 2020, using the medical subject heading or text words "coronavirus disease 2019" "covid-19", or "sars-cov-2" or "cardiac injury" or "biomarkers" or "inflammation and cardiac involvement" (fig. 1) . we search for articles that reported on observational studies or clinical trials promoting any relation between cardiac involvement, inflammation, and covid-19. we considered articles eligible for initial inclusion if they focused on this subject. citations of relevant articles were reviewed to capture additional studies. we also manually searched the reference of previous reviews and all records that received a full-text review. few additional articles before our search years were included if they were referenced in existing articles and included pertinent important data for this present article. no randomized trials neither interventional studies, were available at this time in this investigation, hence, observational studies, long-term prospective cohort studies, case-control, or cross-sectional studies were also included in this article. to be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be written in english, be published in a peer-reviewed journal, provides outcome data on cardiac injury, inflammation, and covid-19. this study was in accordance with the ethical standards of our institutional research committee and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. the included studies were first categorized by whether the study compared clinical outcomes between cardiac involvement and inflammation in covid-19 patients. after the initial search, the authors separately screened all abstracts based on the eligibility criteria. any abstracts or articles for which there was disagreement or uncertainty were reviewed again and discussed until consensus was reached.due to the lack of prospective, randomized, controlled clinical studies on inflammation and cardiac involvement, the exact mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with covid-19 still remains uncertain. however, different possible mechanisms manifested in recent clinical and observational studies can be elaborated and further discussed ( table 1) . [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis alhogbani 11 described the evidence from a coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, manifested as myocardial edema and acute myocardial injury of the apical and lateral walls of the left ventricle. this regional myocardial injury may result from direct viral myocardial infection and inflammation. however, according to a recent pathological study performed by xu et al, 17 there was scarce interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates in the myocardial tissue without substantial cardiac muscle tissue damage in their patient with covid-19, suggesting that the coronavirus might not directly impair on the other hand, in the study performed by guo et al, 5 plasma troponin t levels were positively linear correlated in a significant manner with plasma high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (crp) levels, indicating that myocardial injury may be closely associated with inflammatory pathogenesis during the progress of disease. considering that most of the patients were elderly people with a probable association of coronary heart disease, whether the myocardial injury was directly associated with sars-cov-2 infection is still unclear. direct evidence demonstrating that sars-cov-2 infects the myocardial tissue or pericardial effusion liquid in patients with covid-19 is currently lacking. of interest is that with hundred of thousands of bodies available for autopsy studies, no prospective investigation has been reported so far. elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future proper treatment in case of renewed outbreaks.another plausible mechanism involves the ace2. the latter is a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the virus spike protein of sars-cov-2. since ace2 is also highly expressed in the heart, it is reasonable to hypothesize that covid-19-induced cardiac injury might be mediated by ace2. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] ace2 is a key counter regulatory enzyme that degrades angiotensin ii to angiotensin-(1-7), thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis. although angiotensin ii is the primary substrate of ace2, that enzyme also cleaves angiotensin i to angiotensin- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) and also participates in the hydrolysis of other peptides. ace2 is expressed broadly, including in the heart and kidneys, and the lung alveolar epithelial cells. [20] [21] [22] the complexity underlying the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) clearly shows the different responses to different modulators in the presence of sars-cov 2 infection (fig. 2) . the enzyme active sites of ace and ace2 are distinct. therefore, ace inhibitors in clinical use do not directly affect ace2 activity. 23 experimental animal studies have shown mixed findings with respect to the effects of ace inhibitors and arb on ace2 levels or activity in tissue. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] some studies have shown that arb may increase messenger rna expression or protein levels of ace2 in tissue 24, 30 while others showed no effect. 27 these ostensibly inconsistent results demonstrate the complex raas responses and emphasize the notion that findings from experimental animal studies may not extrapolate to similar physiological responses in humans. this fact shows the importance and relevance of human studies performed on this matter to shed more light for comprehension.at least theoretically, the drug-induced increased ace2 expression produced by acei, or arb might aggravate lung injury of patients with covid-19. however, henry et al, 31 in a previous clinical study, showed a beneficial effect of acei in patients admitted with viral pneumonia. they retrospectively investigated the impact of ace inhibitors and statins on the rates of intubation and death in 1055 adult patients with a positive respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction test. they found lower rates of death and intubation in those patients with continued use of ace inhibitors [odds ratio ¼0.25; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.09-0.64] during the hospital stay. moreover, those patients on ace inhibitors before hospital admission and subsequently discontinued the medication had a higher mortality than those patients who were not on ace inhibitor before admission. they observed a significantly reduction of the pulmonary inflammatory response and cytokine release caused by virus infection. 31 in addition, mortensen et al 32 found a significant decrease in mortality, length of stay, and mechanical ventilation in patients taking ace inhibitors, or arb who were hospitalized with pneumonia and compared with a matched cohort.the study done by kuba et al 33 provided the first genetic proof, a molecular evidence for the severe lung failure and mortality associated with sars-cov. they demonstrated that infections with sars-cov resulted in ace2 downregulation through binding of sars-cov spike protein to ace2 which contributed to the severity of lung pathologies. they further showed that this severity could be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway. 33 as the authors mentioned, the fact of providing a molecular link between sars-cov pathogenesis and the role of the raas in lung failure, envisioned a novel target in the therapeutic management. recombinant ace2 protein could not only be a treatment to block virus spreading but modulation of the renin-angiotensin system could also be utilized to protect patients with covid-19. the beneficial effect of acei/arb may be related to a compensatory increase in ace2. 18 however, the evidence regarding the use of acei/arb in patients with covid-19 infection is still emerging, and larger prospective, randomized clinical studies are required. at present, for patients with covid-19 who previously used acei/ arb, the use of these drug agents may not need to be discontinued based on current data.another possible mechanism involved in cardiac injury may be the increased cytokine secretion during covid-19. in a previous research, 46 patients with established clinical diagnosis of sars-cov were prospectively studied by li et al. 18 they found significantly higher left ventricular index of myocardial performance (0.42 ± 0.13 vs. 0.33 ± 0.09; p < 0.001), longer isovolumic relaxation time (102.9 ± 15.7 vs. 81.6 ± 14.7 milliseconds; p < 0.001), lower flow propagation velocity (69.6 ± 15.7 vs. 83.8 ± 19.7 cm/s; p < 0.011), and doppler-derived cardiac output (4.69 ± 1.01 vs. 5.49 ± 1.04 l/min; p < 0.001) were observed during acute infection when compared with those at 30 days. a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction correlated moderately with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (r = −0.605; p < 0.001), whereas a higher index of myocardial performance correlated weakly with an increase in creatine kinase level (r = 0.38; p = 0.016). in this 30-day echocardiographic follow-up study, they found that reversible, subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment appears to be a common finding in acute sars-cov infection, even among those patients without underlying cardiac disease. they suggested that left ventricular dysfunction in the acute phase of the disease might be attributable to the cytokine storm syndrome resulting from an overaggressive host immune response to sars-cov infection. 18 huang et al 1 found that severely ill patients with covid-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit had higher plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukin (il)-2, il-7, il-10, granulocytecolony stimulating factor, and igg-induced protein 10. they also had higher plasma levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor α. indeed, this is a serious life-threatening disease with clinical features of systemic inflammation, methemoglobinemia, hemodynamic instability, and multiple organ failure. the trademark clinical endorsement of cytokine storm syndrome is a severe, uncontrolled and, dysfunctional immune response involving the continuous activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages. some other markers of inflammatory response, such as crp, procalcitonin, and leukocytes, were also found to be significantly increased among patients who suffered from cardiac injury. 1 the infection-related increased cytokine release is identified by an elevated plasma level of several inflammatory biomarkers. various inflammatory serum markers that are shown to be elevated in patients with covid-19-related cardiac injury are crp, procalcitonin, ferritin, d-dimer, il-2, il-7, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, igg-induced protein 10, chemokine ligand 3, and tumor necrosis alpha. therefore, the storming activation and secretion of these inflammatory cytokines can lead to apoptosis or necrosis of myocardial cells in covid-19. [1] [2] [3] in this regard, huang et al 1 demonstrated an imbalance of t helper 1 and t helper 2 responses resulting in a cytokine storm, which may have contributed to myocardial injury in patients with covid-19. the release of inflammatory cytokines after infection may cause reduction in coronary blood flow and decreased oxygen supply.another interesting factor to consider is the presence of preexisting cvds might also render patients to be more susceptible to covid-19-induced heart injury. shi et al 3 demonstrated that patients with cardiac injury had a history of coronary heart disease (30%) and hypertension (60%), which were significantly more prevalent than in those patients without cardiac injury. wang et al 2 found very similar percentages in their patients who were critically ill with covid-19, 25% had underlying heart diseases and 58% had hypertension. it is reasonable to assume that patients with predisposing cvds such as coronary artery disease or heart failure are susceptible to cardiac injury, and once such patients are infected with covid-19, myocardial ischemia or infarction, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction are more likely to occur, ultimately leading to a sudden deterioration. the intrinsic inflammatory process within the atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary walls is exacerbated during the systemic inflammatory response in covid-19, making them susceptible to fissure initiating an acute coronary syndrome. 19altered myocardial demand/supply ratio in association with increased cardiometabolic demand in the myocardial tissue can result in myocyte hypoxia. this alteration in the context of systemic infection associated with acute respiratory illness-related hypoxia can further impair myocardial oxygen demand/supply relationship and lead to acute myocardial injury. 16 in addition, the systemic inflammation also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases the procoagulant activity of the blood, which can further contribute to the formation of occlusive thrombi over a ruptured coronary plaque. in the context of inflammation and hypoxemic state in covid-19, atrial fibrillation may supervene worsening the prognosis and developing heart failure. 19several observational studies reported evidence of higher morbidity and mortality risk associated to the findings of inflammation and cardiovascular involvement and especially cardiac injury in patients with covid-19 ( . therefore, they concluded that cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with covid-19, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. 3 this is the first study showing that cardiac injury was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19. unfortunately, this study lacks imaging evidence from nuclear magnetic resonance, ct scans, or echocardiography to determine the features of myocardial injury and inflammation. hence, due to the current limited evidence based on clinical investigation of observational studies, the question of whether this novel coronavirus can directly injure the cardiac tissue requires further investigation and demonstration. in this context, there are 3 recent case reports documenting myocardial inflammation and damage with mri and histological studies in patients with covid-19. 36-38 these 3 recent case reports highlight the importance of clinical surveillance and laboratory testing directly targeting serum troponin levels, to guarantee appropriate rapid identification of atypical cases with acute illness of covid-19 to proceed with prompt isolation of patients and eventually to reduce further transmission.viral diseases can harm myocardial cells through direct myocyte damage by the virus, and by systemic inflammatory responses. han et al 34 studied and analyzed in detail the main laboratory markers associated to cardiac injury in covid-19 patients and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease. they specifically analyzed serum levels of creatine kinase isoenzyme-mb, myohemoglobin (myo), cardiac tni (ultra-tni), and n-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp), in 273 covid-19 patients. their patients were divided into 3 groups according to strict diagnostic criteria of their clinical condition: mild (198 cases), severe (60 cases), and critical (15 cases). the positive rate of myo, ultra-tni, and nt-probnp was higher in severe cases and critical cases as compared with mild cases, the differences among the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05).these findings showed that higher concentrations in venous blood of creatine kinase isoenzyme-mb, myo, ultra-tni, and nt-probnp were associated with the severity and mortality of covid-19. of note, the authors analyzed these 4 cardiac injury parameters between the death (n = 24) and alive patients (n = 249). all 4 parameters were significantly higher in the death than in the alive group (p < 0.001). therefore, the authors concluded that careful monitoring of the myocardial enzyme profiles is of great importance in reducing the complications and mortality in covid-19 patients. 34 in this context, an interesting meta-analysis was performed by lippi et al 39 in a total number of 341 patients. they found that tni plasma values were significantly increased in patients with severe covid-19 compared with those patients with milder forms of the disease. therefore, it seems rational to assume that initial measurements of serum biomarkers of cardiac injury should be performed immediately after hospitalization for covid-19 patients, and further in-hospital monitoring may help identifying a subset of severe cases with possible cardiac involvement and consequently predict progression towards a worse clinical scenario.guo et al 5 performed a retrospective single-center case series study to analyzed 187 patients with confirmed covid-19. the mean age was 58.50 ± 14.66 years. they evaluated the association of underlying cvd and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with covid-19. of 187 patients, 144 patients (77%) were discharged from the hospital and 43 patients (23%) died. overall, 66 (35.3%) patients had underlying cvd including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated troponin t (tnt) levels. the mortality during hospitalization was 7.6% for patients without underlying cvd and normal tnt levels, 13.3% for those with underlying cvd and normal tnt levels, 37.5% for those without underlying cvd but elevated tnt levels, and 69.4% for those with underlying cvd and elevated tnts (fig. 3) . patients with underlying cvd were more likely to exhibit elevation of tnt levels compared with the patients without cvd (54.5% vs. 13.2%). plasma tnt levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity crp levels (β = 0.530; p < 0.001) and nt-probnp levels (β = 0.613; p < 0.001). during hospitalization, patients with elevated tnt levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (71.2% vs. 51.1%) and mechanical ventilation (59.6% vs. 10.4%) were higher compared with patients with normal tnt levels. the mortality rates of patients with and without use of acei/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% and 25.6%. therefore, the authors concluded that myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying cvd but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury. interestingly, these authors demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin t and plasma high-sensitivity crp levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively (fig. 4) . guo et al 5 observed 52 (27.8%) patients who exhibited myocardial injury as demonstrated by elevation of troponin t levels, and the mortality was markedly higher in these patients with elevated tnt levels than in those with normal tnt levels (59.6% vs. 8.9%). there was nearly 70% mortality in those covid-19 patients who had underlying cvd and elevated troponin t levels. in addition, their data on nt-probnp showed that its serum elevation and the presence of malignant arrhythmias were significantly more common in patients with elevated tnt levels. moreover, the serum levels of nt-probnp were significantly correlated with tnt levels. in this respect, gao et al 35 studying 54 patients with covid-19 reported that the best cutoff value of nt-probnp was 88 pg/ml for predicting in-hospital death. they found it to have an excellent sensitivity and good specificity (fig. 5) . patients with high nt-probnp values had a significantly increased risk of death comparing to those with low values. after adjustment for potential risk factors, nt-probnp was independently correlated with in-hospital death. 35 the results of these 2 latter studies argue in favor of the concept that the greater the cardiac injury, the greater the ventricular dysfunction in covid-19 patients. also, patients with underlying cvd are more prone to experience myocardial injury during the course of their covid-19.there is no known direct association between the sars-cov-2 itself and the qt interval prolongation in the electrocardiogram of covid-19 patients. however, there is known association to prolonged qt interval and cardiac arrhythmias among certain drug agents that may be utilized in the therapeutic management of covid-19. hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been utilized as potential pharmacological agents in the prophylaxis or therapeutic management in covid-19. both drug agents are known to provoke malignant ventricular arrhythmias in certain patients. [40] [41] [42] hydroxychloroquine acts on the entry and postentry stages of sars-cov-2 via effects on endosomal ph and the resulting underglycosylation of ace 2 receptors that are required for viral entry. since it may prolong the qt interval and develop ventricular arrhythmias, it should be given with extreme cautious in association with other qt interval prolonging drugs (fig. 6 ). there are case reports of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus showing hydroxychloroquine-induced qt interval prolongation and developing torsade de pointes. 43, 44 azithromycin is increasingly recognized as antibiotic that may cause qt prolongation, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, non-pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, torsade des points, and increased risk for sudden cardiac death. 45 there are very limited data evaluating the safety and clinical outcome of combination therapy with these 2 pharmacological agents, and the effect of their combination on qt interval or arrhythmia risk has not been studied. therefore, multiple randomized clinical trials are currently ongoing studies. table 3 shows certain care and safety considerations to consider.the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 appears to be more transmittable, with greater infectivity, and somehow similar or higher morbidity and mortality depending on the area considered, as compared with sars and mers. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] so far, there is a greater incidence of patients with sars-cov-2 who have developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular compromise, or multiple organ failure and death. oudit et al 46 previously demonstrated that the sars-cov genome was positively detected in the myocardial tissue in 35% of the patients with sars-cov infection. this raises the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus itself. sars-cov-2 may share the same mechanism with sars-cov because the 2 viruses are highly homologous in genome. 47, 48 animal experimental studies have shown that some strains of coronavirus infection may seriously affect the heart. for example, coronavirus infection may induce cardiomyopathy that results in cardiac chamber dilatation and impairment of systolic function simulating dilated cardiomyopathy in rabbits. 49 in this context of cardiomyopathy, it is interesting to note that dong et al 50 reported 4 end-stage heart failure patients who were infected with covid-19, 2 of them with severe illness presentation. all 4 patients were male, had typical lymphopenia, and had significantly increased crp level. three patients had elevated tni in the later evolution period, and tni increased significantly a few days before death. moreover, the levels of crp and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher. an interesting finding was that the tni level of the 2 critically ill patients increased significantly by more than 20-fold, indicating important myocardial injury. patients with end-stage heart failure seemed to be older, have more comorbidity, poor general condition, a greater myocardial injury, and higher mortality rate after covid-19.according to the novel knowledge acquired from recent studies on covid-19, those patients who manifested cardiac injury presented with more severe acute illness requiring noninvasive or invasive ventilation compared with patients without cardiac injury. they also manifested clearly abnormal laboratory, radiographic findings, and mortality in half of the hospitalized patients. it is worth comparing these cardiovascular findings in covid-19 with those of sars of about 15 years ago. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] yu et al 10 studied the cardiovascular complications of sars in 121 hospitalized patients. they observed that hypertension occurred in 50.4%. of these patients, 71.9% developed persistent tachycardia, including 40% with continued tachycardia during outpatient follow-up. therefore, tachycardia could not be explained by fever which had already subsided by then. it was neither explained by coexisting hypotension, which was only present in a comparatively small number of patients. although tachycardiarelated cardiovascular complications were common in patients with sars, they were generally self-limiting and not associated with mortality. other types of cardiac arrhythmias were uncommon in patients with sars. transient atrial fibrillation occurred in only 1 patient who had no history of cardiac disease. therefore, the cardiac arrhythmia-associated effect of the coronavirus that causes sars is low. in total, 47 (39%) patients developed arterial desaturation that needed oxygen therapy. however, only 18 (15%) patients were admitted into intensive care unit. only 6 (5%) patients died and, all of them due to pneumonia. 10 in contrast with that from sars findings, more than half of the patients with cardiac injury experienced in-hospital death with covid-19 indicating that this novel coronavirus-induced cardiac injury is associated with major adverse clinical outcomes and worse prognosis. 3 indeed, cardiac injury was found to be independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19.myocardial injury and common pathways of inflammation are significantly associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality and figure 6. hydroxychloroquine therapy according to cardiovascular risk. hcq, hydroxychloroquine; qtc, corrected qt interval. reprinted with permission from ind pac electrophysiol j 2020.overall fatal outcome of covid-19. we identified several potential mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, namely, coronavirus-associated acute myocarditis, ace2 receptor binding affinity to the virus spike protein, increased cytokine secretion, and hypoxia-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis. myocardial injury was found to be related to cardiac dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias, and it was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19. inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. there was a high and significantly positive linear correlation between troponin t and plasma high-sensitivity crp levels, biomarkers of cardiac injury and systemic inflammation, respectively. although, there are several possible mechanisms of myocardial tissue damage, the exact mechanism of cardiac injury needs to be further explored in well-designed clinical studies. strong efforts and continued research of the cardiovascular complications and identification of risk factors for poor prognosis in covid-19 are steadily needed. given the high infectivity and lethality of covid-19 and the enormous economic and social impact of the worldwide outbreak, elucidation of the disease pathogenesis and prospective histopathological studies are crucial for future treatment in case of renewed outbreaks.cvds are still the number one killer in the world, and represent the leading noncommunicable epidemic. since numerous patients with cvd are using acei/arb drug agents, clinical studies may be necessary to explore the potential associations of these pharmacological drugs with the susceptibility and prognosis of covid-19. despite the theoretical concerns and physiological uncertainties concerning the effect of raas inhibitors on ace2, ace inhibitors and arb drug agents should be continued in patients with covid-19 in otherwise stable condition. [51] [52] [53] this is a position supported by multiple medical and scientific societies that needs to be explored by randomized clinical trials to search for the potential associations of these pharmacological drugs with the susceptibility and prognosis of covid-19.the high morbidity and mortality of covid-19, its monumental economic burden and social impact, the despair of a new pandemic outbreak, and the thread of potential utilization of novel sars-cov-2 as biologic weapons make it a preponderant necessity to better comprehend the therapeutic management of this lethal disease. emerging as an acute infectious disease, covid-19 may become a chronic epidemic because of genetic recombination. therefore, we should be ready for the reemergence of covid-19 or other coronaviruses in the near future.nothing to declare.considerations [40] [41] [42] a series of pneumonia cases of unknown origin emerged in wuhan, the hubei province of china, in december 2019, and the clinical presentations were most similar to viral pneumonia [1] . this pneumonia is a newly recognized illness that has spread rapidly across the country and around the world. a few days after the initial outbreak, chinese scientists managed to identify a novel coronavirus [1] , which was later named severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). this virus is classified as a ß cov of group 2b and has at least similarity in genetic sequence to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (sars-cov-1). sars is a zoonosis caused by sars-cov-1, which first appeared in china in 2002 and spread to 29 countries in 2003, causing a global outbreak with 8903 cases [2] .coronaviruses are viruses with single-stranded rna enveloped by a fat-coated substance. this virus belongs to the coronaviridae family and is encountered in humans and mammals. although coronavirus infection is generally mild, the previous two betacoronavirus epidemics, namely sars-cov-1 and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), has caused a cumulative case of 10,000 patients with a 10% case fatality rate for sars-cov-1 and 37% for mers-cov [3, 4] .the clinical spectrum of sars-cov-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill cases. the previous studies reported only the epidemiological findings, the clinical presentation, and the clinical outcomes. however, more specific information identifying critically ill patients remains unknown. recently, cardiac injury has been reported to be associated with mortality [5] . the mortality of critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia is substantial [6] . older patients with comorbidities and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards) are at increased risk of death [6] . therefore, studying the association of acute cardiac injury with the mortality in covid-19 is essential and justified for prevention and preparation in the hospitals facing these global pandemics.in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the association between acute cardiac injury and mortality, the need for intensive care unit (icu) care, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), and severe covid-19 in patients with covid-19.this meta-analysis was accomplished in agreement with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (prisma) statement [7] .we included all research articles in adult patients diagnosed with covid-19 with information on hs-ctnl, cardiac injury, and clinical grouping or outcome of the clinically validated definition of mortality, the need for icu care, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), or severe covid-19. the following types of the article were excluded: articles other than original research (e.g., case report or series, review articles, letters to editor, editorials or commentaries), duplicate publication, and non-english articles.we systematically searched pubmed, scopus, europepmc, proquest, and cochrane central databases with the search terms "covid-19" or "sars-cov-2" and "cardiac disease" and "cardiovascular disease" and "acute cardiac injury" and "ards" and "critically ill covid-19"; search results were limited to the year 2020. duplicate results were removed. the remaining articles were independently screened for relevance by its abstracts with two authors. the remaining investigators read full selected articles that met the requirements and provided final suggestions. these articles were thoroughly read, and those that fulfilled our criteria were included in the study. the final inclusion of studies was merely based on the agreements of all investigators; then, any disagreement was resolved by consensus.the full text of residual articles was assessed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. the search was finalized on march 29th, 2020.data extraction was performed independently by two authors, and we used standardized forms that include authors, year of the study, study design, age, gender, hs-ctnl (including its cut-off point), history of hypertension, history of coronary artery/cardiovascular diseases, cardiac injury, mortality, ards, need for icu care, and severe covid-19.definition of cardiac injury follows that of the included studies, which includes highly sensitive cardiac troponin i (hs-ctnl) n99th percentile, regardless of electrocardiography and echocardiography. as a result, studies that reported elevation of hs-ctnl above the 99th percentile were considered as a cardiac injury.the primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were ards, the need for icu care, and severe covid-19. acute respiratory distress syndrome was defined as per the world health organization (who) interim guidance on severe acute respiratory infection (sari) of covid-19, including the acute onset, chest imaging, origin of pulmonary infiltrates, and oxygenation impairment [8] . severe covid-19 was defined as patients who had any of the following features at the time of, or after, admission: (1) respiratory distress (≥30 breaths per min); (2) oxygen saturation at rest ≤93%; (3) ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (pao2) to the fractional concentration of oxygen inspired air (fio2) ≤300 mmhg; or (4) critical complication (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) [9] .to perform a meta-analysis, review manager 5.3 (copenhagen: the cochrane collaboration, 2014) and stata version 16 (statacorp lp, texas 77845, usa) were used. the continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations (sds) and were calculated using the inverse-variance method. dichotomous variables were calculated using the mantel-haenszel formula. random effects models were used regardless of heterogeneity. mean differences (mds) and risk ratios (rrs) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (cis) for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. the p-value was two-tailed, and the statistical significance set at ≤0.05. sensitivity analysis by leave-one-out was performed to single out heterogeneity.heterogeneity was assessed with the q-statistic test and the i 2 test. the i 2 statistic measured the percentage of total variation across the studies due to clinical or methodological heterogeneity instead of chance. if the significant q statistics (p b 0.05) indicated heterogeneity across the studies, a random effect model was utilized for metaanalysis. otherwise, a fixed-effect model was utilized. substantial heterogeneity was represented by i 2 for n50% [10] .to assess the small-study effect and publication bias, we performed the regression-based egger's test for continuous variable and harbord's test for a binary outcome. we also performed qualitative assessment for publication bias by using inverted plot analysis, an asymmetrical shape indicates publication bias.we found a total of 157 records, and 147 remained after the removal of duplicates. one hundred and twenty-one records were excluded after screening the title/abstracts. after assessing 26 full-text for eligibility, we excluded 13 full-text articles because: 1) no dichotomous outcome of interest (elevated troponin/cardiac injury) and/or hs-ctni (n = 11), and 2) specific population (myocarditis and cardiovascular manifestation) (n = 2). we included 13 studies in qualitative synthesis and 12 in meta-analysis (fig. 1 ). there were a total of 2389 patients from 13 studies [5, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . the baseline characteristics of the included studies are presented in table 1 . all of the studies were retrospective observational. most of the included studies defined cardiac injury as hs-ctni elevation above 99th percentile. there are studies that did not specify their definition of cardiac injury, however, these studies presumably used similar definition to the existing studies (fig. 2) .this meta-analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (rr 7.95 [5.12, 12.34] , p b 0.001; i 2 : 65%, p = 0.009). sensitivity analysis showed that heterogeneity for mortality outcomes the level of hs-ctni was higher in patients with primary + secondary outcome (mean difference 10.38 pg/ml [4.44, 16.32] , p = 0.002; i 2 : 0%, p = 0.92) (fig. 4) .the funnel-plot analysis showed an asymmetrical shape for all outcomes (fig. 5a, b, and c) , indicating possible publication bias. regression-based harbord's test showed no indication of small-study effects for mortality (p = 0.882). egger's test showed an indication of small-study effects for sensitive troponin i and primary + secondary outcome (p = 0.035).this meta-analysis demonstrated that acute cardiac injury, represented by elevated troponin concentration, was associated with increased mortality, the need for icu care, and severe covid-19. although the association between cardiac injury and ards did not show statistical significance, it is essential from a clinical standpoint. these findings are beneficial and should be considered in clinical management, prevention, and preparation for patient safety issues in the hospital in the setting of the covid-19 global pandemic. as previously reported, the mortality of critically ill patients with covid-19 fig. 3 . cardiac injury and secondary outcome. cardiac injury was associated with an increased need for icu care and severe covid-19. the association was not significant for ards. ards: acute respiratory distress syndrome, icu: intensive care unit. pneumonia is high. the survival period of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1 to 2 weeks after icu admission. elderly patients with comorbidities and ards are at increased risk of mortality. consequently, the severity of covid-19 pneumonia poses a high burden to hospital care resources, and a shortage of medical personnel [25] .previously, a letter to the editor reporting a meta-analysis of 4 studies showed that troponin levels were associated with the severity of the disease (presented as standardized mean difference). the result from the subgroup analysis of cardiac injury and severe covid-19 further supported this notion. to the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis that evaluates the relationship between cardiac injury and mortality in covid-19 and presents the effect estimate in dichotomous form as rr (also applicable for the secondary outcome). the present meta-analysis showed that cardiac injury is associated with rr of 8 for mortality. this result gave clinicians more information on the impact and clinical importance of cardiac injury.mortality from covid-19, as shown in the study, is likely due to cytokine storm syndrome and fulminant myocarditis. fulminant myocarditis is primarily caused by a viral infection. it arises quickly, progresses rapidly, and results in severe heart failure and circulatory failure. the clinical presentation is hypotension and cardiogenic shock, with a mortality rate as high as 50%-70% [26, 27] . in a portion of patients with covid-19, interstitial mononuclear cells were shown to infiltrate myocardium in autopsies [28] . case reports on covid-19-induced myocarditis are also available [29, 30] . while the exact mechanism is still unknown, myocardial damage might be due to the direct injury from the virus and exacerbated by the host's secondary immune response. such a phenomenon has been observed in viral myocarditis of other causes and possibly also applies to covid-19 [31, 32] .following spike protein activation by transmembrane protease serine 2 (tmprss2), the viral surface spike (s) protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) [33] . the receptor-binding domain (rbd) in the sars-cov-2 s protein has a higher binding affinity for human ace2 and is significantly higher compared to sars-cov-1 [34, 35] . although ace2 is only slightly expressed in the cardiomyocyte, it was highly expressed in the pericytes. covid-19 may attack pericytes, which is essential for endothelial stability, causing capillary endothelial dysfunction, which leads to microcirculatory disorders [36] . this explains why, although ace2 is only slightly expressed in the cardiomyocytes, covid-19 may cause cardiac injury. patients with cardiovascular comorbidity such as heart failure are thought to be more susceptible to cardiac injury due to significantly increased ace2 expression [36] ; this is further reflected by a meta-analysis of six studies showing that patients with cardiovascular, metabolic disease were at risk for increased severity [37] . however, the rise of troponin in cardiac injury was also paralleled by the increase in inflammatory biomarkers which may indicate the role of cytokine storm in addition to direct cardiac injury [38] . such manifestation may explain why the cardiac injury is potentially linked to ards, which might a be a surrogate marker for cytokine storm or vice versa [39] .our meta-analysis suggests elevated troponin and cardiac injury were associated with poor outcomes. nevertheless, troponin and cardiac injury can be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with covid-19. we simply encourage the inclusion of troponin when constructing a prognostication model for a patient with covid-19. during a 4 . highly-sensitive troponin i and primary + secondary outcome. elevated hs-ctni was associated with poor outcome. hs-ctni: highly-sensitive troponin i. pandemic, risk stratification in triage is necessary, and troponin can be a potential indicator of high-risk patients.the limitation of this study is first, the presence of publication bias; this is possibly due to the shortage of studies pertinent to the issues. most of the articles included in the study were preprints; nevertheless, the authors have made exhaustive efforts to ensure that only sound studies were included. most of the studies are from china; the patients might overlap across the reports. second, the included studies were also mostly retrospective in design.cardiac injury is associated with mortality, need for icu care, and severity of disease in patients with covid-19. the high mortality in covid-19 is very likely due to cytokine storm and fulminant myocarditis. in december 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology emerged in wuhan, central china with a population of 11 million people and was thought to be related to an exposure from huanan seafood wholesale market [1, 2] . this condition was later confirmed to be the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). different from normal pathogens, this virus is powerful and has extended rapidly to other chinese cities and countries, thus leading to the widespread of pneumonia [3] [4] [5] . the number of covid-19 cases has sharply increased in china and by 13 times outside china, and the number of affected countries tripled. consideration its alarming levels of spread and severity, the world health organization characterized covid-19 as a pandemic on march 11, 2020. covid-19 poses a great public health and clinical burden worldwide.the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 have been reported. sars-cov-2 infection has a wide clinical spectrum, including asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory disease, and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory failure and even death. hematological changes, including lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, have been reported in patients with covid-19 similar to sars in 2003 [6, 7] . abnormal coagulation is a common complication of covid-19 and is manifested by pulmonary vascular leakage, intravascular thrombosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. thrombocytopenia is also a common clinical manifestation associated with poor outcome in patients with communityacquired pneumonia [8] . platelets not only contribute to hemostasis, but also participate in inflammation and host defense response. the latter is especially important when the lungs are infected. although many cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients with severe viral pneumonia and thus is a suggestive clinical characteristic of covid-19, the association of baseline platelets and changes with adverse covid-19 outcome remains unclear.here, a hospital-based cohort study was conducted in all patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 to evaluate the association between platelets at admission and mortality, particularly the dynamic changes of circulating platelets and its role in the disease progression.a retrospective cohort study was conducted on 383 patients with covid-19 in the central hospital of wuhan from january 2, 2020 and followed to march 1, 2020. covid-19 was diagnosed according to the world health organization interim guidance [9] . only patients with laboratory-confirmed human infection from throat swab specimens were enrolled, and those with malignant tumors, post craniocerebral operation, died on admission, treatment with anti-platelet drugs, and transferred to other medical institutions were excluded. all enrolled patients were followed up until discharge or death. the requirement for informed consent was waived due to the urgency to collect data on the emerging sars-cov-2. this study was approved by the ethics committees of the central hospital of wuhan.case report forms, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological characteristics were reviewed by a team of physicians who treat patients with covid-19. demographic characteristics (gender and age), comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease), clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes (discharge/ death) were extracted from electronic medical records. laboratory data, including white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, c-reactive protein, procalcitonin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, fibrinogen, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and arterial blood gases (lactate and pao 2 /fio 2 ratio), were collected at admission. additional platelet parameters, including plateletcrit (pct, %), mean platelet volume (mpv, fl), platelet distribution width (%), and platelet larger cell ratio (p-lcr, %) were also gathered. according to the test projectmanual and reagent instructions of the central hospital of wuhan, the normal reference interval of platelet count was 125-350 × 10 9 /l. therefore, thrombocytopenia was defined as a blood platelet <125 × 10 9 /l, and non-thrombocytopenia was defined as a blood platelet >125 × 10 9 /l. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii scores (apache ii), sequential organ failure assessment, and curb-65 criteria were determined within 24 h after admission. data on all treatment measures, including antibiotic, antivirus, glucocorticoid, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and respiratory support, were acquired during hospitalization. throat swab samples were collected from all suspected patients at admission, and the laboratory confirmation of sars-cov-2 was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol (beijing genomics institution and geneodx biotechnology co., ltd.). repeated tests for sars-cov-2 were performed in confirmed patients to verify viral clearance before hospital discharge.baseline characteristics as continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (interquartile range) and n (%), respectively, and examined by mann-whitney u test, χ 2 test, or fisher's exact test where appropriate. the association between baseline platelet parameters and mortality risk was estimated by cox proportional hazards regression models in terms of the following confounders: age, sex, baseline comorbidities (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease). glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin might affect the hematopoietic system, and these treatments are common in clinical practice. in addition, decreased lymphocyte count represents the progression of the disease, c-reactive protein represents the overall inflammation, and augment blood lactate represents acute lung injury, tissue hypoxia and/or oxygen debt and associated mortality critical patients [10] . therefore, we also considered these in regression models. smoothing spline presenting the association of baseline platelet levels and platelets change with subsequent mortality was generated by utilizing the generalized additive model. survival curve was plotted using the kaplan-meier method and examined using the log-rank test. all statistical analyses were performed using r software (the r foundation, http://www.r-project.org, version 3.6.1) and empowerstats (http:// www.empowerstats.com, x&y solutions, inc., boston, ma) unless otherwise indicated. a two-sided significance level of p = 0.05 was used to evaluate statistical significance.among the 383 covid-19 patients with median 18 days (range 4 to 50 days) follow-up period, 334 (87.2%) were discharged and survived, and 49 (12.8%) died. the clinical characteristics of all patients stratified by admission platelets are presented in table i . the median age was 46 years, and 162 (42.3%) patients were male. no significant differences in comorbidities were observed between patients with thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia. patients with thrombocytopenia at admission were likely older and had a higher apache ii score than those with non-thrombocytopenia. most patients were administered with antibiotics, and some were treated with ribavirin (88.3%), oseltamivir (25.6%), and arbidol (20.9%). empiric systemic glucocorticoid therapy (58.2%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (56.1%) were used for anti-inflammatory treatment. noninvasive ventilation was used on 51 patients (13.3%). the thrombocytopenia group had a higher proportion of noninvasive ventilation therapy (26.5% vs. 10.5%) and mortality rate (30.9% vs. 8.9%) than those without thrombocytopenia. the dynamic changes in platelet count from day 1 to day 14 after the onset of the disease were tracked to determine the major clinical features observed during covid-19 progression. compared with that for non-survivors, the level of platelets showed an increasing trend for survivors after admission (p < 0.05, figure 1 ). additionally, platelets were negatively associated with apache ii score, higher of which indicates the higher disease severity at admission ( figure 2 ).at admission, patients with thrombocytopenia had lower white blood cell, neutrophil, and lymphocyte count and higher levels of procalcitonin and c-reactive protein compared with those without thrombocytopenia (table i) . remarkable differences were found in the levels of total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and d-dimer. these indicators were significantly higher in patients with thrombocytopenia than in those without thrombocytopenia. decreased levels of pao 2 :fio 2 were observed in the thrombocytopenia group compared with those in the non-thrombocytopenia group. analysis of platelet parameters revealed that patients with thrombocytopenia had lower levels of platelets and pct and higher levels of mpv and p-lcr than those without thrombocytopenia.cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for several death-related risk factors at admission, including age, sex, baseline comorbidities, lymphocyte count, blood lactate, c-reactive protein, glucocorticoid therapy, and intravenous immunoglobulin. the results revealed that after adjustment for potential confounders, platelets and pct were independent risks for mortality (table ii) . in dose-response analyses, per 50 × 10 9 / l increment in platelet count were significantly associated with abbreviations: apache ii, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii; copd, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; fio 2 , a fraction of inspired oxygen; iqr, interquartile range; pao 2 , partial pressure of oxygen a p values indicate differences between thrombocytopenia and non-thrombocytopenia patients. (table iii ). in the analysis of 261 patients with a platelet count below 200 × 10 9 /l, the association was still robust. a smoothing spline was further plotted to visually present the non-linear relationship between platelets at admission and mortality. we observed the mortality decreased with elevating platelet count, and the curve gradually tends to be gentle when platelet count >200 × 10 9 /l (figure 3a ). continuous tracking of the changes in platelets within the first 7 days after admission revealed that when platelets increased, the risk of death decreased during the treatment and vice-versa ( figure  3b ). further analysis showed that the worst outcome was noted in the subgroup of patients with a platelet level <200 × 10 9 /l at admission and decrease in 7 days, followed by patients with a platelet level <200 × 10 9 /l at admission and increase in 7 days, patients with a platelet level >200 × 10 9 /l at admission and decrease in 7 days, and patients with a platelet level >-200 × 10 9 /l at admission and increase in 7 days (figure 4 ).patients with covid-19 usually have a rapid progression of pneumonitis and even develop ards and death. among the 383 covid-19 patients enrolled, most were admitted with platelets in the normal range, and a few had thrombocytopenia. although the majority of current studies revealed a decreased number of platelets in groups with severe covid-19 [6, 7] , no research has investigated the dynamic changes of platelets and estimated the association of baseline platelets and platelets change with subsequent mortality in patients infected with sars-cov-2. in the present study, clinical characteristics were compared between patients with and without thrombocytopenia. cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to adjust for several death-related risk factors at admission. our study highlights the following: (a) thrombocytopenia at admission was associated with mortality that is almost three times higher than that in patients without thrombocytopenia; (b) platelet count was an independent risk factor for covid-19 mortality; and (c) the dynamic changes of platelets were closely related to death during treatment. our study highlights that platelet monitoring might be important for covid-19 prognosis. data are presented as hazard ratios (hr) and 95% confidence intervals. p trend was estimated using the median value of each quartile. model 1 adjusted for age, sex, and baseline comorbidities (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease); model 2 adjusted for model 1, plus glucocorticoid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, blood lactate, c-reactive protein, and lymphocyte count enhanced platelet activation leading to platelet deposition in damaged pulmonary blood vessels has been supported by various clinical studies, and thrombocytopenia is an important feature of sars [11, 12] . thrombocytopenia has exceeded 50% incidence rate in patients with sars and is an important indicator of poor prognosis [13] [14] [15] . a meta-analysis with 1779 covid-19 patients reported that thrombocytopenia was associated with threefold-enhanced risk of severe covid-19 and an lower platelet count was observed with mortality [16] . similar to this study, the current work confirmed that thrombocytopenia at admission is associated with death in patients with covid-19. platelets in patients with sars are negatively correlated with their svcam-1 levels. svcam-1 is involved in adhesion and chemotaxis and contributes to early vascular injury and suppression of t cell function. vascular injury or immunosuppression may explain the poor outcome [17] . by using the cox regression model for multivariate analysis, we found that platelets and pct are independent risk factors that predict death. although platelets were routinely measured daily, the role of platelets and pct in predicting the outcome of patients with covid-19 has not been previously reported, and the correlation between platelet dynamics and disease prognosis has not been studied. different platelet thresholds have been used in epidemiological studies for the incidence, risk factors, and consequences of thrombocytopenia among critically ill patients [18, 19] . in our cohort, a nonlinear relationship between platelets at admission and mortality was observed, and the trend tends to be gentle when platelet count >200 × 10 9 /l (figure 3a ). further analysis showed that patients with a platelet level <200 × 10 9 /l at admission and decrease in 7 days had the highest mortality rate, whereas those with a platelet level >200 × 10 9 /l at admission and increase in 7 days had the lowest mortality rate. moreover, thrombocytopenia had a close relationship with prognosis even within the normal reference range. the dynamic changes of platelets within the first 7 days after admission were negatively correlated with the prognosis. cox proportional hazards regression models displayed a 40% decrease in mortality risk for every 50 × 10 9 /l increase in platelets. in summary, platelet count is an important prognostic marker for patients with covid-19, and the dynamic levels of platelets during treatment are closely associated with death. pct was calculated from platelet count, and its levels at admission still retained a detrimental effect on clinical outcome [20] .the mechanism of sars-cov-2 on thrombocytopenia is poorly understood, but several potential explanations are considered [21] . histological examinations of lung necropsy from patients with covid-19 revealed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates as dominated by lymphocytes; this finding has raised the possibility of immunopathological damage for lung tissues [22] . damaged lung tissues would cause platelet activation and aggregation in the lungs, and thrombi formation at the site of the injury may lead to the consumption of platelets and megakaryocytes. in addition, sars-cov-2 induces a low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulopathy state characterized by the elevation of d-dimers and fibrinogen and further table iii . association between the increase of platelet per 50 × 10 9 /l and mortality

consumption of platelets in damaged lungs. the lungs may be the sites of platelet release from mature megakaryocytes [23] . inflammation and long-term oxygen treatment also result in extensive alveolar damage and other pulmonary pathological changes. the pulmonary capillary bed is morphologically altered, thus further affecting the lung megakaryocyte fragmentation and megakaryocytopoiesis. the increased consumption and decreased production of platelet may affect thrombocytopenia. similar to sars coronavirus, sars-cov-2 thrombocytopenia may involve other mechanisms. this new condition may directly infect hematopoietic precursor cells and inhibit their growth. cd 13 and cd66a are expressed on human bone marrow cd34 + cells. sars-cov-2 may induce growth inhibition by binding to the cd13 or cd66a of hematopoietic cells and bone marrow stromal cells, resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis and immunodeficiency [21] . the body undergoes immune-mediated hematopoietic stem cell damage, thereby further leading to thrombocytopenia. this study is subjected to several limitations. first, as an observational study, we cannot conclude that the reported associations between platelet parameters and mortality are causal. second, we cannot exclude the possibility of remaining residual confounding or unmeasured potential confounders. third, the pathological mechanism of platelet parameters in the progression of covid-19 remains poorly defined, and further clinical and basic research are necessary to clarify this issue. although this study is the first to identify the association between platelet parameters and mortality risk in patients with covid-19, a large-scale and multi-center study is warranted to confirm these findings.this hospital-based cohort study among 383 confirmed patients with covid-19 revealed an association of baseline platelets and platelets change with subsequent mortality. hence, monitoring platelets during hospitalization may be important in the prognosis of patients with sars-cov-2.the novel coronavirus (covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to international health system and economy. this study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (covid-19) infections. the data on the global outbreak of covid-19, were obtained from world health organization (who), worldometer, centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and research institutes. the information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in pub med and institute of scientific information (isi) web of science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to covid-19 infection outbreaks. the results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus covid-19. during the period of december 29, 2019 through march 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. the infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age. the mean growth rate index for total number of cases from january 23 to march 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. there was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (r2=0.996). the novel coronavirus covid-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. it is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. the global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. however, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the covid-19 epidemics.biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus covid-19diabetes mellitus (dm) is a complex chronic disease characterized by high blood glucose, absolute and relative insulin deficiency. it includes type1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and special type diabetes. among them, the morbidity of type 2 diabetes was the highest. the global prevalence of t2 dm in 2017 is estimated to be 4.63 billion. [1] in 2017, the total number of deaths caused by high fasting plasma at all ages was 6.5 million, of which type 2 diabetes accounted for 1 million deaths. [2] novel coronavirus pneumonia (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is seriously endangering human life and health and property safety. march 11, 2020 by the world health organization (who) announced as a global pandemic. [3] many early studies have found that patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes are more severe and have worse prognosis. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] a number of retrospective analysis of patients with covid-19 showed that the prevalence of diabetes patients increased in varying degrees, and the condition was usually more serious than that of general patients. [9] [10] [11] the analysis in china by chinese center for disease control and prevention (cdc) shows that the mortality combined with diabetic patients is 7.3%, while the overall mortality is 2.3%. [12] the national institutes of health in italy reported that the prevalence of diabetes in patients who died of sars-cov-2infection was 35.5%. [13] according to the preliminary data from the american centers for disease control and prevention on march 28, 2020, diabetes is the most common basic health condition among the people infected with sars-cov-2, about 10.9%. furthermore, it is estimated that yy and wz contributed equally to this work and are co-first authors. this project is funded by treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (covid- 19) with integrated traditional chinese medicine and western medicine. (2020yfs0013). the sponsors are not involved in design, execution, or writing the study.the authors report no conflicts of interest.data sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study. 32% of the patients who need to be admitted to icu. [14] diabetic patients are more likely to suffer from serious infection due to hyperglycemia, chronic inflammatory state, microcirculation damage and other factors. [15] it was found that type 2 diabetes may increase the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) in the lung. [16] the novel coronavirus pneumonia is promoted by ace2 as a binding site of sars-cov-2, but the decrease of ace2 expression may result in severe lung injury after infection. [17] serious infections, serious diseases and glucocorticoids can damage insulin sensitivity, so infectious diseases lead to high mortality of diabetic patients. [18] however covid-19 mortality combined with diabetes is still not clear. the duration, age, gender, race and blood glucose control of diabetes may have effect on the mortality of covid-19. our study will solve that by meta-analysis and it is very necessary.the report of this system review plan is in accordance with the preferred report item of the system review and meta-analysis plan (prisma-p) guidelines. [19] [20] this study will be conducted in accordance with the prisma extension statement of nma. [21] population: adult dead from covid-19 will be included in our study. there are no restrictions on the region, gender and age of patients.intervention: this study will investigate comparisons of diabetes and non-diabetes covid-19 patients. according to whether diabetes mellitus is combined, they are divided into diabetes group (trail) and no diabetes group (comparison). patients who do not die will be excluded.outcomes: the primary outcome will be the mortality ofcovid-19 patients. secondary outcomes will include the blood glucose control level and inflammatory markers.study design: all studies on mortality of covid-19 will be included in this study.the mortality of covid-19 fbg (fasting blood glucose) pbg (postprandial blood glucose) hba1c (glycated hemoglobin) crp (c-reactive protein)computer retrieval three english database including pubmed, embase, the cochrane library, and 4 chinese databases including china national knowledge infrastructure (cnki) database, wanfang data knowledge service platform, the vip information resource integration service platform (cqvip), china biology medicine disc (sino med) will be searched from their inception to april 30 2020, with a language limitation of english and chinese. in addition, google scholar and baidu scholar will be used to find out potential missing papers. there is no time limitation about literatures. novel coronavirus pneumonia, covid-19, mortality, prognosis, and blood glucose control, diabetes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, new coronavirus pneumonia, crp, are the key words for search. to identify other eligible studies, reference lists of relevant publications will be reviewed for a manual search. an example of search process is presented in table 1 .based on the pre-determined inclusion criteria, two independent reviewers will evaluate all titles and abstracts to exclude papers that are not considered relevant. the remaining provisions will be included in a further assessment. reviewers will carefully examine the full text of each potentially relevant article. the process of study identification and exclusion will be described by prisma flow chart. differences in research options will be resolved through consultation, and record in excel file (fig. 1.) .two researchers independently screened literature, extracted data and cross checked them. in case of any difference, it shall be settled through discussion or consultation with a third party. in the process of literature selection, the first step is to read the title. after excluding the obviously irrelevant literature, the second step is to read the abstract and the full text to determine whether to include it. if necessary, contact the author of the original study by email or phone to obtain the uncertain but very important information for this study. the content of data extraction includes:1. basic information: the first author, publication time, research location, sample size, sex ratio, age, research type; 2. outcome indicators of concern; 3. relevant elements of bias risk assessment. bias risk assessment included in the study: 2 researchers independently assessed the bias risk of the included study with nos scale, and cross checked the results.data analysis will be conducted in review manager version 5.3 and stata 14.0 software for mac. the risk ratio (rr) was used as the analysis statistic and 95% ci was provided. the heterogeneity of the results was analyzed by x 2 test (the test level was a = 0.1), and the degree of heterogeneity was determined byi 2 . if there is no statistical heterogeneity between the results of each study, the fixed effect model is used for meta-analysis; if there is statistical heterogeneity between the results of each study, the source of heterogeneity is further analyzed. after excluding the influence of obvious clinical heterogeneity, the random effect model is used for meta-analysis. the level of meta-analysis is set as a = 0.05. significant clinical heterogeneity was treated by subgroup analysis or sensitivity analysis, or only descriptive analysis.if there is substantial heterogeneity between studies, then we will conduct subgroup analysis to explore the heterogeneity. to avoid post hoc analysis, the subgroup analysis will be conducted according to 3 hypotheses: race, course of diabetes, glucose level. to further improve the reliability of subgroup analysis, we will evaluate the credibility of our subgroup analysis according to the guidance for credible subgroup analysis. if there are enough studies included, then meta-regression will be conducted to further explore the heterogeneity. those subgroup effects that occur simultaneously in subgroup analysis and regression analysis will be considered credible.draw funnel chart for all-cause mortality outcome indicators of diabetes and no diabetes covid-19 patients. to ensure the stability of the results, we will conduct sensitivity analysis of the results by excluding each of the studies included in the analysis one by one, then re-analyzing the results, and comparing the differences between the re-obtained results and the original results. in this way, we will be able to assess the impact of individual studies on overall outcomes and their robustness.the integrity of the studies is an important factor affecting the accuracy of the results and conclusions of meta-analysis. the integrity of the included studies is mainly measured by reporting bias, of which publication bias is the most common. therefore, this study will identify report bias by publication bias assessment.a funnel plot will be drawn to investigate the publication bias. funnel plot will be asymmetric when publication bias exists, such as when research with small sample and no statistically significant results are not published. the more obvious the asymmetry of funnel plot is, the more likely there is publication bias [22] and then egger test will be conducted for statistical assessment the publication bias. the publication bias is considered to exist if p < .05 . [23] 2.12. patient and public involvementno patients or public will participate in the study.since confidential patient data will not be involved in this study, formal ethics approval is not required. the frame-work of the prisma statements for nma will be applied to guide review authors to perform this study. the results will be disseminated by a peer-reviewed publication.covid-19 is widespread all over the world, causing great casualties and property losses. it is a battle related to all mankind. this study is a comprehensive and systematic review, aim to compare the mortality of covid-19 between diabetes and nondiabetes. we will analyze the sex, age, course of disease, race and blood glucose control level of covid-19 dead patients. so that the prognosis of patients with new diabetes mellitus will be predicted and the blood glucose control should be strengthened in the clinical treatment. the epidemiology of covid-19 incidence, severity of illness and mortality seem to be shifted towards older people particularly those with diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. [24] considering research costs and data arrange our study did not analyze diabetes related complications. next study will consider providing a systematic review of the role of diabetes complications in the development of covid-19. meanwhile this is of great practical significance to clarify the harm of diabetes to public health. it can also provide reference for clinicians.if any modification is required, we will update our protocol to include any changes in the entire research process.conceptualization: yan yang, wen zhong, chunguang xie. data curation: xiaoxu fu. formal analysis: yan yang, wen zhong. funding acquisition: chunguang xie.according to the world health organization (who) records, on 31 december 2019 a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in wuhan, china was first reported to the who country office in china. on the 20 th of january 2020 the media around the world report the news of the human-tohuman transmission of this new coronavirus, while on the 30 th of january the who declares the outbreak a public health emergency of international. while italy, iran and south korea had already experienced a significant outbreak of the new coronavirus, it was only on 11 march 2020 that the covid-19 was declared a pandemic by who. there are now confirmed cases of covid-19 in every continent except antarctica.what is particularly worrying about the new coronavirus is its high degree of transmissibility and infectivity along with its great potential to develop into severe illness and death (wang et al. 2020) . indeed, to minimise the impact of covid-19 pandemic on public health, over 100 countries worldwide had impose strict restrictions on movement of people and social gatherings (hale et al. 2020) following the drastic measures taken in china in an attempt to 'flattening the curve'. italy, the first country outside china to experience a large-scale health impact of covid-19, imposed a (partial) nationwide lockdown since 9 march 2020. whilst the italian government was praised by who for an implementation of such a measure (never employed in modern democratic nations since wwii), given the evidence that the virus spread under-detected in the northern part of the country already since late january 2020, strict measures might have been imposed too late. as a consequence, the outbreak has put unprecedented strain on the italian healthcare system, resulting in an exceptionally high number of coronavirus deaths, currently the second highest in the world after the us.as the covid-19 outbreak spread aggressively in other countries like spain, france, the uk, the us, country disparities in covid-19 deaths became distinct. in particular, italy is shown to have the highest case fatality rate while germany, austria and norway are among the countries the lowest rate (global health 5050 2020). accordingly, the media has constantly trying to dig out the underlying reasons behind the country differentials in covid-19 deaths. comparing covid-19 deaths across countries, however, is challenging for several reasons, ranging from disparities in testing coverage, the criterial for defining a covid-19 death to practice in post-mortem examination (garcía-basteiro et al. 2020) . one way to overcome the inconsistency in the differences in measurement of incidence and fatality is to consider excess mortality. data on weekly or daily excess deaths, for instance, would allow scientists to compare the observed deaths in 2020 with the mortality patterns typically observed in previous years (leon et al. 2020) .exploiting daily death registrations data published by the italian statistical office (istat), this paper provides the first evidence-based assessment of the impact of covid-19 on mortality and life expectancy in the first hardest hit epicentres outside china. three main features characterise the present analysis. first, covid-19 deaths are estimated using excess mortality measures rather than relying on the official report of the number of deaths attributed to covid-19. this way the mortality estimation does not suffer from biases related to sampling in testing and reporting policies. second, the analysis focusses specifically on bergamo and brescia, the two hardest hit provinces in lombardy, northern italy. the two provinces were sometimes compared to wuhan given their position as epicentres of the outbreak, which experienced a rapid escalation in the number of infections resulting in an insufficiency of healthcare resources and intensive care units (porcheddu et al. 2020 ).the highly clustered nature of local transmission results in high concentration of severe illnesses and deaths in one area (jia et al. n.d.) . therefore, the direct impact of covid-19 on mortality and average life expectancy is likely to be felt at a sub-national level rather than in a whole country. finally, at the moment of writing, the epidemics in bergamo and brescia appear now to have been contained given that the epidemic curve has presented a downward trend in the first wave of infections. the results presented here are thus based mainly on hard number observed in these regions rather than on some forms of simulations with underlying assumptions. focusing on the areas where the outbreak appears to have slowed down allows us to capture a fuller picture of the impact of the virus on mortality and life expectancy. hence, by using complete and reliable data on the number of deaths for the first largest-scale outbreak outside china, this paper provides the first unbiased account of the mortality impact of covid-19 and its consequence on life expectancy.in the analysis, we compare mortality rates in 2015-2019 and 2020 across age and gender categories and provide estimations of how life expectancy changes following the covid-19 pandemic. the motivation driving our analysis is discussed in the next session, where the main methodological choices regarding the measures and the geographical areas are discussed in depth. in the background section, we provide a short description of the policy measures implemented for tackling the epidemic. next, the set of results are divided in two parts. first, rough excess mortality rates are presented. these values are the used to construct potential life expectancy based on different assumptions for the rest of the year 2020. in the final discussion part, we underline the most important lessons to be drawn from the evidence and conclude.this paper aims to provide the first evidence-based assessment of the human life consequences of the covid-19 pandemic based on unbiased weekly death registrations data. in particular, the choice of using overall daily mortality rather than official covid-19 figures is motivated by two major concerns. first, during the last couple of months it has become clear that there exists no uniform way of classifying covid-19 death. there is a variation across countries in counting mortality "from" and mortality "with" covid-19. italy, for instance, include any persons who tested positive for the virus when they died in the official covid-19 death toll statistics regardless of the pre-existing diseases that may have caused death (onder et al. 2020) . likewise, whilst countries like belgium and france after 2 nd april 2020 include coronavirus deaths outside hospitals in its official daily report, countries like the uk, italy or spain do not. some countries such as belgium, the uk and the us record covid-19 deaths also from suspected cases and do not require a positive laboratory diagnosis like in germany and the netherlands (roser et al. 2020 ). in addition, when the epidemic worsens, the counting of fatalities becomes more difficult. people dying at home or in long-term care facilities might indeed not be tested at all simply because resource allocation prioritises emergency operations. even within the same country, it is difficult to compare the number of cases and deaths in different regions given disparities in regional policies and testing strategies and capacities . therefore, weekly death registrations data from all causes are more comparable across countries and regions (leon et al. 2020) . this is important given the need to share generalisable information in order to track the progress of the epidemics, to guide the implementation of prevention and control measures as well as to plan when to relax social distancing measures.a second advantage of using overall mortality measure is that it allows us to capture the negative spillovers associated with the drop in supply of hospital-based services due to covid-19. the reduced access to hospitals, emergency rooms (often closed during the outbreak), acute hospital beds and clinical activities could contribute to peaks in mortality for other medical conditions that are not directly related to the epidemic. obviously, these deaths should be considered as death as an indirect consequence of covid-19. in other words, a study that consider excess all-cause all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the

during the period of the epidemic like ours provides a complete assessment of the impact of covid-19 on population health and human life.most of the existing literature has relied on mortality measures, especially case-fatality rates (cfr) (cdc covid-19 response team 2020; giangreco 2020; khafaie and rahim 2020; onder et al. 2020 ), which are not informative for international and historical comparisons. since case-fatality rates are calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases, the absence of accurate estimation of the infection rates in a reference population makes the denominator in the cfr relies heavily on testing strategies and capacities . although much of the attention from the media and who has been devoted to increasing the number of coronavirus testing to as many people as possible (who 2020), little has been said about a sampling strategy. the only possible way to obtain reliable information about infection rates is through selecting and testing a representative sample of the population (galeotti and surico 2020) , an approach only very few countries have actually implemented. only recently in april 2020, iceland and austria were the first countries to carry out a random-population screening test. this is understandable, since testing has been used as a measure of containment through isolating infected patients (together with tracing). however, testing only suspected cases implies a selection bias in a sampling approach which fails to provide unbiased estimates of infection rates in a population, no matter how many tests a country runs. the figures on infection rates based on unrepresentative sample testing thus are likely to be misestimation of the true prevalence.another important feature of the present study is its specific geographical focus on bergamo and brescia, the two hardest hit, relatively small provinces in lombardy, northern italy. due to the clustering nature of the virus outbreak, an analysis at the national level would underestimate the scale of the impact of covid-19 on mortality and life expectancy. with a total population of approximately 2.3 million in the two provinces, a large-scale excess mortality can indeed affect life expectancy of a population in these small areas. in addition, the containment measures through lockdown were introduced too late given that the virus had already been circulated undetected in the region as early as in january 2020 (l'eco di bergamo 2020; reuters 2020). this allows the epidemic to develop in its "purest" form, showing the potential impact of the virus in absence of any intervention measures to reduce its spread. hence, when indicators like life expectancy are calculated, the reference population should naturally be the one experiencing the consequences of the epidemic. on the contrary, if the national data are considered and the outbreaks have been contained, the negative impact of the epidemic on potential years of life loss might end up being heavily underestimated.finally, our study extends beyond current studies on the health impact of covid-19 which typically focus on mortality by focusing on life expectancy related measures. whilst studying covid-19 mortality rates are certainly important, they need to be collapsed in an index which is universal enough to provide a reliable measure of human life lost. in this regard, life expectancy is a consistent, objective measure of human development since it represents overall wellbeing of populations in a simple and non-bias form (ghislandi et al. 2019; sen 1998) . furthermore, reliable measures of life expectancy are available for some countries since the nineteenth century. this makes it possible to use life expectancy for historical comparisons of the human costs associated to major eventsin the early morning of the 20 th february 2020, the first severe local case of covid-19 was diagnosed in europe, in a small hospital in codogno, a municipality south east of milan. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license

but it soon became clear that identification of a patient zero would be difficult, if not impossible. indeed, later studies have shown that covid-19 was present in the lombardy region since the first half of january 2020 (cereda et al. 2020 ; l'eco di bergamo 2020; reuters 2020). the area around codogno was immediately declared a "red zone" and a complete lockdown was enforced in 11 municipalities, while universities and schools in lombardy were immediately closed. the region was about to enter what is probably the most serious public health and economic crisis after-wwii period. however, in the ten days following the presence of patient one, the nature of the epidemic was downplayed by most media and authorities, including some health experts. testing strategies changed in due course, with only patients showing a combination of symptoms being tested. lockdowns were gradually and slowly introduced only when it became clear that important outbreaks were on the way. on 8 march 2020 the whole lombardy was declared "orange zones", just one day before the rest of italy. non-essential activities were however stopped only on 23 rd march 2020.the nature and the adequacy of the response to the covid-19 epidemic has been discussed elsewhere and is still ongoing (winfield 2020) . in this context this brief excursus is useful in order to understand the timing and the geographic distribution of the events. specifically, the timing is crucial here. bergamo has been the first and hardest hit province in lombardy. by 14 march 2020, all beds in intensive care units (icus) of the main hospital of the city were already filled. as it will become clear later, the wave of hospitalizations and deaths started around the very first days of march. indeed, it has already been noticed that bergamo is a case where the "flattening of the epidemic curve" policies were introduced too late, and hence not being very effective. a similar situation, with a few days delay, can be said for brescia.we rely on a compendium of administrative data provided by the italian national institute of statistics (istat). we use daily death counts for all causes at the municipality level, disaggregated by sex and age class (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, …, 95-99, 100+). they cover the period between 1 st january and 30 th april for the years 2015-2019, while for 2020 the observation period extends up to 4 th april. importantly, istat does not collect and release data on daily death counts for all municipalities 1 . as of today, these data are available only for municipalities which meet the following three criteria: (i) have been included in the recently established national register of resident population (anpr), (ii) have recorded at least 10 deaths between 1 st january and 4 th april, and (iii) have recorded an increase of at least 20% in the number of deaths registered between 1 st march and 4 th april 2020 compared to the 2015-2019 average over the same period. in both our areas of interest, i.e. the provinces of bergamo and brescia, about 72% of municipalities are included in the anpr, totaling to 175 and 149 respectively. out of these, istat has released daily death data relative to 2020 for 122 municipalities in the province of bergamo and 101 municipalities in the province of brescia.in addition to this dataset, we rely on four further sources of information. first, we make use of annual death counts at the municipality level, disaggregated by sex and by age class (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, …, 95-99, 100+). these data extend up to 2017. second, we obtain data on resident population at the municipality level, disaggregated by sex and single-year age classes (0,1,…,100+), on january 1 of years 2015-2019. we reclassify age classes so as to match the 1 these data have been collected and released by istat ad hoc to better document the evolution of local mortality upon the covid19 epidemics outbreak. as such, istat has been focusing so far on a subgroup of municipalities where excess mortality in 2020 is most likely attributable to the epidemics. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the

level. these data are available up to december 2019. finally, we collect data on monthly death counts, disaggregated by sex, at the municipality level. these data are available up to december 2019.we estimate the resident population by age and sex in the provinces of bergamo and brescia on 1 st january 2020 by the following steps. first, we aggregate resident population data by year, age class and sex at the province level. then, we estimate the female and male resident population in each age class at the provincial level on 1 st january 2020 by means of linear extrapolation based on years 2015 to 2019. likewise, we use available data on monthly live births between january 2015 and december 2019 to estimate monthly births over 2020 in the provinces of bergamo and brescia.we measure excess mortality at any time t of 2020 as the difference between the observed and the expected number of deaths in 2020 in t. we defined the expected number of deaths in t as the average number of deaths observed in t over the period 2015-2019.we calculate seasonal life expectancy between 1 st january and 4 th april for the years 2015-2020 (separated for men and women). for this purpose, we calculate seasonal age-specific mortality rates for each year. the numerators (i.e. the death counts) are recorded daily. thus, aggregation over the period 1 st january and 4 th april at the provincial level is straightforward. the corresponding exposures (i.e., the denominators) were estimated as follows. starting from the estimated resident population on 1 st january in 2020, we counted age-specific person-days up to 4 th april. theoretically, these counts are a function of four demographic events, namely births, ageing, migration, and dying. the daily inflow of births is estimated by using monthly birth data and assuming that these births are uniformly distributed over each month. the effect of ageing, i.e. individuals might transition in-and out of a given age interval, is modeled by giving each individual the probability of 1/365 for turning one year older during the observation period. the outflows due to deaths are straightforward as age-specific death counts are known on a daily basis. we neglect migration because the population under study is quarantined. in sum, the exposed population at day t in age group x is given by the population alive at day t-1 in age group x plus those who age into age group x at day t minus those who either die in age group x or age out of the age group x in day t. we express the obtained daily exposure values in terms of person-years by multiplying them by 1/365 (1/366 for leap years). then, we derive age-specific mortality rates for the period 1 st january to 4 th april. finally, life tables are built following standard procedures outlined by the human mortality database protocol. we estimate confidence intervals for life expectancies by bootstrapping using monte carlo simulation methods, assuming death counts follow a binomial distribution (andreev and shkolnikov 2010; chiang 1984) . further, the method proposed by arriaga (1984) allows for decomposing changes in life expectancy into agespecific contributions. we applied this approach in order to assess, which age-groups have primary contributed to the change in seasonal life expectancy between 2019 and 2020.when estimating life expectancy at the end of the year, harvesting (i.e. the reduction in mortality rates following peak mortality associated to shock events) should be taken into consideration. hence, we estimate life expectancy for the entire 2020 considering two alternative scenarios, which we define as "conservative" and a "business as usual". in the conservative scenario (full harvesting), we assume the mortality rate at the end of the year will be the same as in 2017. in this approach, the main effect of covid-19 would be to anticipate mortality to the first quarter of all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was

https://doi.org/10. 1101 the year 2020. this scenario is probably not a very likely one, but it represents a clearly defined upper bound for life expectancy in 2020. in other scenario, harvesting is set to zero and we assume that after the end of the epidemic, mortality rates will go back to the average levels recorded in the previous years. there are good reasons to assume that mortality will not reduce substantially after the end of the first wave of covid-19 infections. for example, because of most of the resources and health services have been directed to covid-19 patients, people with other medical conditions such as cancer were under-treated. likewise, although most vulnerable people have been doing self-isolation and locking themselves inside, it is highly possible that they would get the virus later after restriction measures are lifted. as a matter of fact, mortality after the epidemic wave might actually increase, especially among the working age population, as a consequence of the lockdowns and the likely economic recessions as has been observed, for example, in greece (laliotis et al. 2016 ). however, for this paper, we are not making assumptions on the indirect impact of covid-19 pandemic on mortality after the epidemic ends. therefore, if anything, years of life lost due to covid-19 for the year 2020 may in fact be underestimated.based on the evolution of daily mortality observed until 4 th april, we posit that the epidemics in our area of interest, i.e. the provinces of bergamo and brescia, should be over by 30 th april. to estimate life expectancy for the entire 2020, we need to project the evolution of deaths after 4 th april. we use cubic spline extrapolation to project the number of daily deaths in each age class from 4 th april until 30 th april. after 30 th april, we project mortality until the end of the year based on two scenarios. in the "conservative" scenario, we assume that after the end of the covid-19 epidemics, deaths in each age class will occur such that the total number of deaths in 2020 equals the total number of deaths registered in 2017 2 . if the cumulative number of deaths by the end of the epidemics in any age class exceeds the total number of deaths registered in 2017, we assume zero deaths will occur after the end of the epidemics in that age class. in the "business as usual" scenario, we assume that mortality will return to the average levels recorded in 2015-2017. these are the most recent years for which data on annual death counts are available. thus, it is possible to derive the number of deaths occurring after 30 th april as the difference between the annual death counts and deaths registered up to 30 th april for the years 2015-2017. as we do not know the daily distribution of deaths after 30 th , we make two assumptions. for age groups <50, we assume that deaths occur uniformly over the period 1 st may -31 st december 2020. for age groups ≥50, we assume that deaths between may and december 2020 occur following the 2015-2019 average distribution of monthly deaths. we then assume that deaths distribute uniformly within each month between may and december 2020.we then proceed with the estimation of population exposure for each day between 1 st january and 31 st december 2020 under both scenarios following the same procedure detailed above. finally, we aggregate death counts and population exposure values over the entire year to derive age-specific mortality rates and life expectancies under both scenarios.bergamo and brescia represent the highest number of municipalities with an outlier number of deaths. their distribution across the provinces is displayed in figure 1 . clearly, bergamo province shows a higher number of "red" areas. in addition, figure a1 (in appendix) shows the same municipalities within lombardy, comparing the same graph with veneto, the region that, together with lombardy, was the epicenter of the very first clusters of covid-19 in the last week 2 2017 is the last year for which data on yearly death counts disaggregated by age and sex at the municipality level is available. all rights reserved. no reuse

of the losses are observable in the areas of bergamo and brescia. indeed, in the whole country no other provinces display such a monumental upward trend in mortality.the maps plot the % change in total number of deaths recorded between jan 1-apr 4, 2020 with respect to the 2015-2019 average. table 1 shows the age and sex distribution of the total excess mortality by province. compared to the average number of people that died in the same period in the five years before (2015-2019), the excess number of deaths between 1 january 2020 and 4 april 2020 for bergamo and brescia sums to 6549. 64% of mortality of this excess mortality is witnessed in bergamo. covid-19 affected slightly more men than women (56% of excess deaths) whilst at the national level 65% of covid-19 deaths involve male mortality (global health 5050 2020). however, this almost gender balance in the number of deaths does not reflect an equality in the relative mortality risk between sexes. in general, men are up to 3.5 times more likely to die from covid-19 than women. in fact, the risk of dying for men is higher than for women across all ages except for the under 50 in bergamo, where the risk ratio is slightly below one.age clearly represents the most important predictor of absolute excess mortality related to covid-19. for example, from table 1, one can deduce that in our sample a man over 70 years is 10 times and 37 times more likely to die than a person under 70 and under 60 years of age respectively. the number of people dying for covid-19 peaks in the 80-89 age interval. note that the proportional increase in mortality due to covid-19 in this age class did not spike as much as it did for the under 40 or the 40-49. in fact, for the 80-89 the expected mortality is already very high in regular times. still, in the first quarter of 2020, in bergamo the 80-89 mortality increased by 350% for males and 250% for females. similar figures are observed for the 90+ and for the 70-79. note that for the age group 90+ the gender disparity in covid-19 mortality reverses due to a naturally much higher number of women living until over 90 years of age (niu et al. 2020) . this is consistent with the outbreaks spreading in care homes, which are all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a

data of most countries (comas-herrera et al. 2020) . in brescia, the number and the relative increase in mortality for the 70+ are lower than in bergamo, with female and male mortality increasing in 2020 roughly by 190% and 220% respectively. however, a much higher than expected number of under 40, both males (1300%) and females (infinite increase) died in brescia municipalities. figure 2 shows trends in daily mortality within each of the two provinces from raw data. it is evident how the epidemic curve inflates with age and how this age effect is particularly remarkable for bergamo. it is also clear that our last day of observation is already on a downward pattern of daily mortality. indeed, on the 4th of april the epidemic wave was already towards the end in both provinces. this allows us to rely on hard data for the most part of the infection wave, reducing our reliance on modelling in the estimation of the total number of deaths related to this first wave of infection.from the graphs shown in figure 2 , it is also evident that the rumors of an unexpected peak of flu mortality in 2020 can be rejected. by mid-march the seasonal flu, which started in december 2019, was at the very final stages of its wave. however, during the first two months and a half of 2020, mortality across age classes did not show any significant unexpected peak. hence, the observed trends do not support the hypothesis that the boost in mortality could be caused by the interaction of covid-19 with seasonal flu. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified

(males and females combined). the red vertical lines show relevant dates for the evolution of the epidemic.vertical lines show four relevant dates for the evolution of the epidemic. the misalignment between drastic containment measures ("orange zone", 8 march, and closure of all non-essential activities, 23 march) is striking. if one considers that the time between infection and the development of severe and critical conditions could be as long as three weeks, it is evident that the lockdowns were imposed too late.in order to measure the human life impact of this epidemic on the two provinces, we show two set of results: 1) changes in the age structure; and 2) changes in life expectancy. as stated in the methods section, when predicting mortality for the rest of the year, two scenarios can be defined. in the 'conservative' scenario, harvesting is complete and the overall mortality rates by age at the end of the year are maintained constant with respect to the previous years (unless the number of deaths by 4 april already exceeds the overall expected deaths for 2020). in the 'business as usual' scenario, the after covid mortality drops at its regular values observed in the previous years. harvesting is thus set to zero.to the purpose of estimation, the cumulative number of people that died for covid compared to the expected annual death by age is an important information. figures a2a and a2b in the appendix report its evolution by age classes in both provinces, for men and women respectively. it is impressive to notice that in the province of bergamo the number of 70-79 men that died by 4 all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display

same municipalities in 2017.it has been argued that the impact of the covid epidemic should be understood also by looking at the age structure of a population (dowd et al. 2020) . from the evidence provided so far, it is clear that age is the main risk factor for covid related mortality. figure 3 reports the changes in the age pyramid between 1 january 2020 and: a) 4 april 2020 b) 31 december 2020, in the two scenarios.overall, the age pyramid is going to be affected significantly at the top levels. the number of "missing" people among the elderlies at the end of 2020 is going to be significant, especially in the extreme scenario. note also that elderly women seem to be the most affected by the epidemic in terms of covid. this reflects the fact that among the 80+, 63% are females.life expectancy has reduced accordingly, as shown in figure 4 . the drop at the end of the observation period is significant, especially for the men in bergamo. when seasonal life expectancy is calculated, the reduction in 2020 for males reaches 8 years. for women, the reduction is less marked, although seasonal life expectancy at 4 april 2020 is around 5 years lower than in 2019. we refer to the discussion part for the interpretation of these figures. when life expectancy is extrapolated to the whole year, the loss in life expectancy is of course diluted over a longer period and hence reduced. in the conservative case of full harvesting, nothing all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has

previous years. this is a very unlikely situation, but one that represents a potential upper bound. if mortality goes back to regular times ("business as usual"), life expectancy for males and females will drop by respectively 3.5 and 2.5 years in bergamo, and by 2.3 and 1.5 years in brescia. figure 5 shows the decomposition associated to the loss of life expectancy by april 2020, by age and sex. clearly the major role is played by older populations. the role of mortality in 60-79 years old men is particularly evident. at the same time, the 90+ women in bergamo, despite their much older age, are still responsible of more than half a year loss in life expectancy.all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has

directly and indirectly linked to covid-19 without any bias in testing coverage and classification of cause of deaths. by focusing on the two hardest hit areas in lombardy and italy, bergamo and brescia, we are able to capture the full impact of covid-19 on population health and human life.the first important piece of evidence refers to the duration of the epidemic wave. by 4 april 2020 the daily mortality in both bergamo and brescia was approaching the regular values observed in 2019. hence, the time between the first sign of an epidemic wave (first three days of march) and the (possible) return to normality is likely to be between 6 and 8 weeks, with the peak happening around two weeks from the start. it is likely that the lockdown policy might have contributed to the reduction of mortality in the late stage of the epidemic wave. however, containment policies were not implemented during the initial spread of the infections, when the virus circulated undetected in lombardy; hence they played no role in reducing mortality in the first part of the epidemic wave.regarding the demographic characteristics, two empirical regularities emerge clearly. first, the age gradient in mortality is steep and age represents the most evident risk factor for covid-19 mortality. in our sample, men aged over 70 are 10 times and 37 times more likely to die than their counterparts aged under 70 and under 60, respectively. second, gender disparities in the percentages distribution of deaths are not as large (56% deaths involve male subjects) as reported for the whole nation of italy (65%). however, this figure is misleading: the risk of dying for a male is between 1.5 to 3.5 higher than that for a female, depending on the age class and the province considered. men are thus more at risk of mortality, but since covid-19 affects the elderly the most and women are overrepresented among those aged 70+, absolute figures show a high number of deaths also among the females. this age gradient of mortality affects the age pyramid as well, with elderly women being associated to the sharpest reduction in their number by the end of 2020.in terms of life expectancy, we have shown two main set of results. first, when focusing on the period 1 jan to 4 april 2020, life expectancy in bergamo reduced by around 8.1 and 6.5 years compared to 2019 for men and women respectively (4.5 and 3.4 years in brescia). one way to understand these figures is to imagine that they represent what would happen if the 1 jan to 4 april period were to be stretched for the entire year, so that the epidemic would last around four months over twelve. fortunately, this is not the case because the epidemic wave had a limited all rights reserved. no reuse allowed

version posted may 5, 2020. . https://doi.org/10. 1101 duration. nevertheless, these figures give us an idea of the power of the epidemic wave that crushed the provinces.return to normality in bergamo and brescia is not going to be straightforward. the near future is hard to predict. for this reason, when calculating life expectancy at the end of the year we focus on very simple assumptions, i.e. focusing only on the impact of the first epidemic wave. only harvesting effect is considered as possible consequences of covid-19 epidemic on mortality. two scenarios of full harvesting (conservative) and no harvesting (business as usual) are introduced. by construction, the conservative scenario does not show significant changes at the end of the year. this is because, although the number of deaths by 4 april exceeded the expected yearly number of deaths in some age class, it did so only by a small number.on the other hand, the no harvesting scenario implies a loss in life expectancy of around 4.5 and 2.8 years for males and females, respectively in bergamo (2.2 and 2.4, respectively in brescia). although the conservative scenario represents a logical extreme upper bound to any estimation of life expectancy, the business as usual is a more realistic one.but how can we interpret these results? one good feature of the life expectancy indicator is that it provides a historical perspective over the human consequence of relevant shocks (ghislandi et al. 2019 ). looking at figure a3 in the appendix, it appears evident that such a sharp decrease in life expectancy has not been experienced in modern history since the second world war. in terms of the pandemic impact on years of life lost, we are observing a large-scale loss in life expectancy second only to the spanish flu in 1918, where, according to figure a3 , life expectancy for italy dropped by more than 15 years. for the usa, noymer and garenne (2000) estimate reduction in life expectancy of 11.8 years. the differences between the covid-19 pandemic and the 1918 flu pandemic are very distinct. first of all, the spanish flue typically killed the young, which of course, all else equal, reduces life expectancy much more. second, the outbreak of the spanish flu occurred at the same time as the first world war when no public health and preventive measures were implemented. finally, the medical technology and knowledge was much less advanced, with penicillin and other crucial pharmaceutical products not yet being available. it thus can be said that the years of life lost in bergamo and brescia, although not at the level achieved after the spanish flu, are of a substantial scale given a much more advanced medical technology and the absence of war in the present day.note that our analysis focuses on a local context. given that the covid-19 outbreaks are geographically concentrated, looking at a country level life expectancy is misleading and underestimates the actual impact of the pandemic. indeed, from our results, it is fair to conclude that this is a lifetime unprecedented shock for most of the residents in bergamo and brescia.the main limitation of the present study is related to the limited coverage of the death registrations data used, both geographically and temporally. all the information provided here has been retrieved from a number of the most affected municipalities in bergamo and brescia. so, the estimation represents an attempt to describe and measure the human cost of covid-19 among the populations that were hit the hardest in a country. this study does not represent the experiences of italy and lombardy region but also by choice, we intend to investigate the impact of covid-19 on human life in the areas where little containment interventions were put in place. from the point of view of the timing, we have enough information to actually picture the entire evolution of the epidemic wave. however, when it comes to life expectancy for the year 2020, we need to rely on harvesting assumptions and we exclude the possible negative impact of the present and future lockdown policies and global economic recessions on health and human life.in this sense, this paper only focuses on the direct impact of the pandemic and, if anything, may underestimate the years of life lost due to the covid-19.nevertheless, the timing of this paper is also its strength. indeed, the present analysis represents the first attempt to provide an evidence-based assessment of the human life impact of a frontline covid-19 outbreak. in doing so, we raise a warning for the scientific and public health community around the world: the epidemic, when undetected and not contained, can easily get out of control and cause relevant social and human consequences. in defining the lockdown strategies governments should balance the costs of limiting social and economic activities with the human costs of possible epidemic waves. vulnerable populations should be protected with a particular attention and constant monitoring of the epidemic progression. this should be given a priority in order not to get caught by surprise by devastating epidemic waves like the ones experienced in bergamo and brescia.human life in itself is a solid indicator of human development because it represents health and wellbeing of a population, which is one key priority of the sustainable development goals. so many years of life lost due to covid-19 pandemic is worrying since it sets the affected areas back to their level of human development 20 years ago. as shown in the case of bergamo and brescia, the cost of human life from a delay in public interventions to reduce the virus transmission is disturbingly high. amidst countries' preparation to ease the lockdown restrictions and social distancing measures, it is important to keep in mind the conceivable risk of viral reintroduction and a potential direct and indirect cost it can pose on human life. well-planned government measures to prevent a second wave of infections along with public collaboration in keeping physical distancing and practicing proper hygiene until a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is available are key to achieve a balance between health and economic protection.the maps plot the % change in total number of deaths recorded between jan 1-apr 4, 2020 with respect

viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the sars coronavirus (sars-cov). the origin of sars-cov is still unsettled and remains a controversial subject to date. sars-cov is phylogenetically divergent from other coronaviruses associated with human infections such as oc43, nl63, 229e, and hku1, but is closely related to civet and bat covs. 4 however, none of the currently known bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (sars-cov) is thought to be the direct ancestor of sars-cov. 5 sars was the first severe and readily transmissible new communicable disease of the 21 st century. 6 the epidemic first started around mid-november 2002 in guangzhou where at least two patients had atypical pneumonia of unknown cause. 7 the initial cases were meat handlers who had regular contact with wild game. 4 shortly after, similar cases were reported in five cities in guangdong province, however, no escalation of public health measures was announced. by february 2003, the outbreak had unfolded and there were 305 cases reported with five mortalities. 7 8 in hong kong, 1755 people were infected and 299 died; 386 infected cases were healthcare workers and eight of them died. 8, 9 no case of sars has been reported worldwide since 2004.however, suspicious cases were reported from time to time. 3 the incubation period for sars-cov is between 2 and 10 days with a mean of 5 days and up to 13 days, symptoms usually develop 2 to 10 days after the initial infection. the immune response includes immunoglobulin m (igm) antibody to the sars-cov-this peaks during the acute or early convalescent phase (week 3), and declines by week 12. igg antibody is produced later and peaks at week 12. 10 the first symptom of sars is fever of 38°c (100.4°f) or higher, followed by nonspecific flu-like symptoms such as chills/rigor, muscle aches and pain, headaches, diarrhea, sore throat, runny nose and malaise. the symptoms usually last about 2 to 7 days. affected patients may develop a dry cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia.in severe cases, the patient can develop respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). in the sars outbreak of 2003, about 9% of patients with confirmed sars infection died. 11 the mortality rate was much higher for those over 60 years old, with mortality rates approaching 50% for this subset of patients. 11 in the sars epidemic, there were around 135 pediatric sars cases reported worldwide, the majority of them in hong kong. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] in pediatric cases, the presenting features can be nonspecific, hence a postive contact history and environmental exposure became very important diagnostic clues. fever was a consistent symptom in all affected children, and lasted for a median duration of 6 days, while other common symptoms included cough (60%) and nausea or vomiting (41%). 12, 13, 17 teenage patients present with symptoms of malaise, myalgia, chill, and rigor in addition to cough and respiratory symptoms similar to those of adults, while the younger children presented mainly with cough and runny nose. 13 the symptoms and clinical course were milder and shorter in young children. lymphopenia was an important laboratory finding but more severe among teenagers. 13 the most prominent radiological features included patchy infiltrates, opacities, and areas of consolidation predominantly in the lower lobes. 14 no pediatric mortalities were reported in the literature. 12 in a case series of 43 children with sars in hong kong, five required picu care and one patient required invasive ventilatory support. 17, 18 children who were 12 years of age or younger generally had a milder illness and more favorable outcome. 12 the pathophysiology of a milder disease course in children is not clear, and proposed yet putative mechanisms include relatively low dosage of ribavirin, shorter course of corticosteroids, and a less mature immune system, resulting in less autoinflammatory injury in the young. 19 follow-up of sars patients at 6 months after the illness only showed mild residual changes in exercise tolerance and pulmonary function. 12 osteonecrosis was reported in children whose sars treatment included steroids; they remained mostly asymptomatic and managed conservatively. 16 there were two reported cases of transmission from children to adults and no reports of transmission from children to children. 6 as to vertical transmission, in all reported cases of maternal sars during pregnancy, the infants survived and no perinatal transmission was detected. 6 in summary, respiratory symptoms are milder and nonrespiratory symptoms are present in pediatric patients. the mean incubation period for mers-cov is 5.2 days, and ranges from 2 to 13 days. symptoms may range from mild to severe and include fever, cough, diarrhea, and shortness of breath.spread between humans typically involves close contact with an infected person. human-to-human transmission has been limited and mainly among family members and healthcare workers. there have been clusters of cases in healthcare facilities, where infection prevention and control practices were suboptimal, however, its spread was uncommon outside of hospitals. 20, 22 overall, 17.9% of the cases reported were healthcare workers. 21 there have been no reports of sustained human-to-human transmission; thus, its risk to the global population is currently deemed to be fairly low. 20 the high morbidity associated with mers may be spurious due to bias of inadequate sampling that had missed a much larger denominator with elusive milder cases. 23 as of 2019, there was no specific vaccine or treatment for the disease; a number of antiviral medications were being studied. 20 the who recommends that those who come in contact with camels wash their hands frequently and not touch sick camels, and that camelbased food products should be appropriately cooked. in essence, symptomatic and supportive treatments constitute therapies.of the cases reported to who, 20.8% had mild to no symptoms while 46.5% had severe disease or died. 21 mers is typically more severe in those with other health problems, more than half of the reported cases had had comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, chronic renal failure, or lung disease), which might explain the high mortality rate. 20, 21 the overall risk of death may be lower than reported as those with mild symptoms may be undiagnosed. 24 the rate of pediatric mers-cov infection is relatively low in comparison to adults. 23 a large saudi arabian study that screened for mers-cov by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) testing in a selected at-risk population, including 8032 children (<14 years old) found 0.1% who tested positive when compared with 0.7% in adults. 25 the most common source of infection was household contact and acquired infection within a healthcare facility. 26 approximately 42% of affected children are asymptomatic. 26 the most common presenting symptoms are fever (57%), vomiting (28%), diarrhea (28%), and cough (14%). 26 the severity is lower in comparison to the adult population. in one series of 31 pediatric cases, only one patient required intensive care support and there were no deaths. 26 only two fatal pediatric mers-cov cases were found in the literature, and both cases had comorbidities (infantile nephrotic syndrome and cystic fibrosis). 27 4 | covid-19the culprit of the recent pandemic in 2020, termed by the who as 30 according to wuhan health officials, the pneumonia appeared to be viral in nature and patients were placed in isolation.potential causes including influenza, avian infleuenza, adenovirus, sars-cov, and mers-cov were ruled out. 31 since there was highly suggestive evidence that the outbreak was associated with exposure in wuhan's huanan seafood wholesale market, the market was closed on 1 january, 2020. 32 the mean incubation period for sars-cov-2 is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days, with an average of 5 days. 35 there is evidence of humanto-human transmission through droplets or direct contact; and precautions should be practiced in the healthcare settings to prevent airborne transmission, which may be underestimated, among many uncertainties about this novel virus. 36 there have been confirmed cases in healthcare workers, and the reported cases were 3.8% and 20% of the total confirmed cases in china and italy, respectively. 31, 37, 38 with the ascertainment of asymptomatic carriage, the risk of transmission within the community is very high. 39 the most common symptoms include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, or fatigue. 30 in a series of 41 cases, only a few patient had prominent upper respiratory tract signs even though abnormalities in chest computed tomography (ct) images were detected among all patients. 30 ct chest scans have a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of covid-19 as compared with pcr swab samples; and the findings include bilateral, subpleural, ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms, ill-defined margins, and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe. 40, 41 indeed, ct chest abnormalities are now diagnostic criteria in the latest "novel coronavirus diagnosis and treatment plan" published by the national health commission of the people's republic of china. 42 in a report of 72 314 cases prepared by the chinese center for disease control and prevention (cdc), a majority (80.9%) of the cases were classified as mild, while 4.7% were critical cases. 31 the age group ≥80 years old had the highest case-fatality rate at 14.8%. 31 treatment is mainly supportive, as no antiviral treatment has been clinically proven to be effective against sars-cov-2 and there are no standard treatment guidelines recommended by the who.the protease inhibitors lopinavir-ritonavir can be considered, but the results of a recent clinical trial are discouraging. 43 remdesivir and chloroquine have been shown to have good inhibitory effect on sars-cov-2 in vitro. 44 remdesivir is now undergoing phase ii clinical trials in treating patients with covid-19. 45 hydroxychloroquine, sometimes in combination with azithromycin, has been widely used in both europe and the us with little evidence of efficacy, and early analyses point to increased risk and higher mortality. 46, 47 long-term outcome for covid-19 patients is yet to be de-reported that about 14% of recovered patients were tested postive for sars-cov-2 in follow-up checks several weeks after discharge. this is deemed most likely due to residual rna in clinical samples rather than reinfection. 48 given that a robust test has yet to be developed, speculations about results of the testing include false negativity at the time of discharge, inadequate specimen, less desirable site of specimen acquisition (eg, specimen taken from the throat vs the nasopharynx), testing discrepancies, new tests finding the virus in the lower respiratory tract, and reinfection. most infected children had relatively milder symptoms and recovered within 1 to 2 weeks. 53 several of the patients had no overt clinical symptoms and were found by positive screening of infected close contacts. 53 a study reviewing the epidemiology of 2135 pediatric cases in china revealed the proportion of severe and critical illness to be higher in the younger age group, in particular infants. 54 in the report by the us centres for disease control and prevention, among the aged less than 1 year with known hospitalized status, 62% were hospitalized; compared to 4.1 to 14% among those aged 1 to 17 years. 50 around 2% of the pediatric cases require admission to the intensive care, which is low comparing to the adult population. 55 there were less than 10 pediatric deaths reported worldwide. 31, 50 children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission and there were evidence of covid-19 infections in children occurring early in the epidemic. 56, 57 there is no convincing evidence hon et al.| 1587 of vertical transmission to neonates so far with only a couple of studies finding igm in neonatal blood, but no viral rna in samples from the respiratory tract. 58, 59 however, early onset covid-19 disease in neonates has been reported. 60 the reason for the decreased incidence in childhood is yet to be clarified, but it has been postulated that children are less susceptible to covid-19 because of lesser maturity and function of ace2 receptor, the cell entry receptor of sars-cov-2, compared to adults. [61] [62] [63] officials and experts compared similarities and differences of the acronyms and believed that they are all novel and impactful syndromes.they may have fever, respiratory symptoms, history of contact or travel, an animal vector and a novel coronavirus, and significant mortality and morbidity. there are relatively minimal or no differences in these acronyms except for the nomenclatures ( table 1 ). the fact that a significant number of patients with covid-19 are mildly symptomatic vs patients with sars and mers, with low mortality rates, reflects that sars-cov-2 resembles other common circulating respiratory viruses.however, the lack of any population immunity against sars-cov-2gives it the ability to cause high attack rates, which can overwhelm and cripple healthcare systems if not managed carefully.similarities and differences between sars, mers, and covid-19 are tabulated hereunder (table 1) . it is perhaps unnecessary to coin confusing and seemingly different acronyms for each of these recurring epidemics and coronaviruses. 1 the syndrome approach (as in sars) as opposed to disease approach (as in covid) has its pros and cons (table 2) • the clinical definition can be applied to any similar epidemics for surveillance without knowing the culprit pathogen.• sensitive.• the sars concept of surveillance is easy to apply in epidemics.• the acronym is used even in afebrile, asymptomatic carriers or patients with mild and extrapulmonary symptoms in some laboratory-confirmed sars patients.• stigmatizing many patients because the definition is too nonspecific or too sensitive.• may not be used for a non-coronavirus (eg, influenza or measles) or another novel coronavirus (eg, mers) even if the symptoms are severe, acute and respiratory.• may miss nonfebrile patients or patients with extrapulmonary symptoms.• contact or travel history is only good in early phase of an epidemic.• new acronym has to be coined ( | 1589 these characteristics. whether beyond the virus there might be environmental changes that have occurred over the two-decade history of these infections, that enhance its spread, such as rising temperatures, or other yet to be determined atmospheric changes. it is hoped that because of the devastation that covid-19 carries in its wake, large efforts will be invested in a search for answers to these questions, and with that, we will all be able to be wiser in dealing with the threats of the future. this will require the combined efforts of a global community, since the current events clearly manifested our interconnectedness and interdependence and hence shared vulnerability in the face of a calamity of previously unexperienced magnitude.kam lun hon

coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has affected the whole world and declared as a pandemic by world health organization (who) on march 26, 2020 1 . according to worldometer metrics, this novel virus has been responsible for approximately 6,615,298 infections, of which 3, 195 ,971 cases are recovered and 388,759 cases were died worldwide up to june 4, 2020.after months of efforts by the medical communities, there is still no specific approach for prevention and treatment against the coronavirus disease 2019 . also, competition of pandemic with infodemic has led to many controversies and challenges globally.in this regard, one of the hottest topics these days is the role of vitamin d in prevention or treatment of covid-19. several functions such as modulating adaptive immune system and cell-mediated immunity, as well as increase of antioxidative-related genes expression have been proven for vitamin d as an adjuvant in the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory infections 2, 3 . according to available investigations, it seems that such functions lead to cytokine storm suppression and avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), which has been studied on other pandemics and infectious diseases in recent years [4] [5] [6] .to best of our knowledge, unfortunately, after several months there is no adequate high-quality data on different treatments regimen, which raises questions about gaps in scientific works. in this occasion, when there is an essential need for controlled randomized trials, it is surprising to see only observational studies without a control group or non-randomized controlled studies with retrospective nature covering a small number of patients.the same issue is debatable for 25-hydroxyvitamin d (25(oh)d); hence, concerning all of the limitations and analyze difficulties, we carried out a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis with great caution and sensitivity in order to try for maximizing the use of everything that exists about the role of this vitamin in the covid-19. additionally, along with this systematic review, we also performed an ecological evaluation to find any relations between global status of vitamin d and covid-19 recovery/mortality rates. to be honest, we know that working on observational studies give an overestimation of the required value. therefore, whatever the result with the vitamin d we can present that the result, by our approaches, is also an overestimation of reality; which is very fascinating in itself to get in the current situation, especially through what we found in our ecological approach.the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guideline was considered for study plan. a systematic search through databases of pubmed, scopus, embase, cochrane library, web of science and google scholar (intitle) as well as preprint database of medrxiv, biorxiv, research square, preprints.org, search engine of sciencedirect and a rapid search through famous journals was done up to may 26, 2020. moreover, to obtain more data we considered gray literatures and references of eligible papers. the search strategy included all mesh terms and free keywords found for covid-19, sars-cov-2, and vitamin d. there was no time/location/ language limitation in this search.four researchers have screened and selected the papers independently and the supervisor solved the disagreements. studies met the following criteria included into meta-analysis: 1) comparative or non-comparative studies with retrospective or prospective nature; and 2) studies reported the role of vitamin d in confirmed covid-19 patients. studies were excluded if they were: 1) in vitro studies, experimental studies, reviews; 2) duplicate publications.two researchers (h.j and m.m) have evaluated quality assessment of the papers and extracted data from selected papers. the supervisor (d.sh) resolved any disagreements in this step. data extraction checklist included the name of the first author, publication year, region of study, number of patients, comorbidity, vitamin d status, serum 25-hydrovitamin d levels, ethnicity, mean age, medication dosage, treatment duration, adverse effects, radiological results, and mortality. the modified newcastle-ottawa scale (nos) checklist for cross-sectional studies was used to value the studies, concerning various aspects of the methodology and study process.according to risk factors such as older age, male, obesity, underlying chronic disorders, higher latitudes, darker skin pigmentation etc., which are common between vitamin d deficiency and covid-19 toward the severity of the condition, despite the various possible explanations, we hypothesize that vitamin d plays a role in severity of responses to covid-19 and vitamin d deficiency can be in correlation with covid-19 mortality rate and recovery rate.in this regard, alongside with our main objective, to find the second aim as an ecological investigation we carried out a literature search in pubmed database for identifying the national or regional studies reported the vitamin d status throughout the world. data of infection, mortality and recovery of covid-19 cases were gathered from the worldometer metrics. the meta-analysis was done between all of the published studies in each region for pooling vitamin d mean levels.in this case, according to an international conference on "controversies in vitamin d" 7 , vitamin d cut-off points were considered as follows: i-square (i 2 ) statistic was used for heterogeneity evaluation. following cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions 8 , the i 2 was interpreted as follows: "0% to 40%: might not be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. the importance of the observed value of i 2 depends on (i) magnitude and direction of effects and (ii) strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. p-value from the chi-squared test, or a confidence interval for i 2 )." thus, random-effects model was used for pooling the outcomes in case of heterogeneity; otherwise, the inverse variance fixed-effect model was used. forest plots were presented to visualize the degree of variation between studies.meta-analysis was performed using comprehensive meta-analysis (cma) v. 2.2.064 software. pooling of effect sizes was done with 95% confident interval (ci). fixed/randomeffects model was used according to heterogeneities. in case of zero frequency, the correction value of 0.1 was used.correlation of mortality and recovery rates in covid-19 patients with vitamin d status was evaluated using spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r). according to cohen's classification of effect width 9 , value of r=0.1 was considered as small effect, r=0.25 as medium effect and r=0.4 as large effect. the p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. data were analyzed using spss software version 16 (spss inc., chicago, il, u.s.a.).begg's and egger's tests as well as funnel plot was used for publication bias evaluation. pvalue less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.. cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the

preprint this version posted june 8, 2020. results of quality assessment for studies entered into meta-analysis based on modified version of nos tool for cross-sectional studies were fair.results of begg's and egger's tests in effect size meta-analysis showed no significant publication bias (pb=1.00; pe=0.44). the funnel plot for publication bias of studies presented in fig. 2 .the meta-analysis of event rates showed that 46.5% of covid-19 patients were suffering from vitamin d deficiency (95% ci, 28.2%-65.8%) and in 43.3% of patients, levels of vitamin d were lower than the normal range (95% ci, 27.4%-60.8%) (fig. 3) . table 2 .the world vitamin d distribution map and its relations with recovery rate as well as mortality are presented in fig. 4 . considering mean levels of vitamin d, sars-cov-2 infection as well as covid-19 mortality and recovery data throughout the world, spearman's rank correlation coefficient analyses indicated no correlation between vitamin d levels and recovery rate (r= 0.041) as well as mortality rate (r=-0.073) globally.in detail, in asia with overall mean levels of 57.326 25(oh)d (95% ci, 56.959-57.693) a substantial direct correlation was observed between vitamin d status and recovery rate (r= 0.317) as well as a significant reverse correlation for the mortality rate (r= -0.700). in europe, there were no correlations for both recovery (r= 0.040) and mortality rate (r= -0.035). in middle east, although there was a direct correlation between recovery rate and vitamin d status (r= 0.267); also, mortality rate was mediumly in reverse correlation with vitamin d status (r= -0.217). in north america, surprisingly, both recovery (r= 1.000) and mortality rates (r= 1.000) were highly correlated to the vitamin d levels. in sought america, both recovery rate (r=0.500) and mortality rate (r=0.500) were in a significant direct correlation with 25(oh)d levels. in oceania, unexpectedly, recovery (r= -1.000) and mortality (r= -1.000) rates were in substantial reverse correlation with 25(oh)d levels.considering latitude factor as an adjustment for countries in latitudes higher than ±50°, partial correlation analysis showed a small reverse correlation between mortality rate and vitamin d status throughout the globe (r= -0.177), but no correlation was observed for recovery rate (r= -0.072). this analysis showed a direct correlation in case of mortality rate in europe r= 0.164. although comparing global statistics of covid-19 outcomes is difficult, it is clear that the mortality rate is higher in several countries. it seems that various factors such as age, healthcare system quality, general health status, socioeconomic status, etc. nonetheless, one of the underestimated factors, which might be associated with covid-19 outcome is the vitamin d status in every populations. investigations on respiratory infections indicated that 25hydroxyvitamin d can effectively induce the host defense peptides against bacterial or viral agents and vitamin d insufficiency/deficiency can lead to non-communicable as well as infectious diseases 2, 94, 95 . the other potential role of vitamin d is reduction of inflammatory induced following sars-cov-2 infection. in fact, vitamin d affects the renin-angiotensin system pathway and promotes the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), which downregulates by sars-cov-2 96 .concerning all of the limitations and no adequate high-quality data about relation of vitamin d status and covid-19 after several months, we have conducted this systematic review and metaanalysis in order to maximize the use of every available data, which would give us an overview toward further studies like what we have done recently on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in covid-19 patients 97 , which have underestimated first, but the value was revealed after a while. we also hypothesize that vitamin d deficiency can be in correlation with covid-19 mortality rates and recovery rate, which has studied through an ecological strategy.unfortunately, there were no clinical trials and high-quality data regarding the role of vitamin d in covid-19. according to available data entered into our meta-analysis, we could only find that approximately half of the patients infected with sars-cov-2 were suffering from vitamin d deficiency and this vitamin was insufficient in about 43% of them. in case of relation between vitamin d levels and mortality/recovery rate of covid-19 patients, some researchers were reported the dependence of covid-19 morbidity and mortality to the latitude 99, 100 ; similarly, our hypothetical strategy and big data analysis resulted several direct and reverse correlations in this regard. a quick look at the fig. 5 shows that there is no regular relation for mortality or recovery rate by increasing vitamin d levels, but significant fluctuations observe regarding each country.despite the fluctuation, considering latitudes, showed a small reverse correlation between vitamin d status and mortality rate worldwide, which indicates that populations with lower levels of vitamin d might be in higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection. however, focusing on continents and countries one by one, indicates interesting findings in this case. for example, vitamin d status in asia, middle east, africa and oceania is correlated to the mortality reversely, whereas, it is in direct correlation with mortality in both north and sought america. this might attract the considerations to the racial and ethnic aspects of the subject in different regions and populations 101, 102 . in case of recovery rate, while most of the continents indicated a direct correlation with vitamin d status, africa and oceania are significantly showed a reverse correlation in this regard. considering table 2 , in africa, the highest mean levels of vitamin d is related to guinea-bissau and tanzania. this finding might be due to the numerous challenges such as human resource, health care systems budgetary, poor management, etc. in such regions [103] [104] [105] , which unavoidably affects the subject significantly. about oceania, it seems that extremely high rate of recovery in both australia and new zealand led to this statistical outcome.ultimately, to best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive systematic review that carried out a meta-analysis for investigating the role of vitamin d in covid-19 patients along with a wide ecological consideration. however, after releasing outcomes of underway mentioned rcts, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on this subject could be more conclusive and reliable.it is worth noticing that the current meta-analysis includes the following limitations:1) studies entered into the meta-analysis were observational and cross-sectional; thus, comparative analyses were not applicable in first part of study; 2) there are inevitable challenges with reliability of data due to different strategies in testing (e.g. vitamin d measurement, covid-19 test, etc.), various subpopulations, etc. in both first part and ecological part of study; 3) other immunomodulator factors (e.g. vitamin c, zinc, selenium, etc.), which might be effective in the outcome of covid-19 patients, have not considered in included studies; and 4) type ii statistical errors following studies with small sample size. eventually, to overcome the limitations and bias, results of the study should be confirmed by robustly large multicentral randomized clinical trials.the conditional evidence recommends that vitamin d might be an important supportive agent for the immune system, mainly in cytokine response regulation against pathogens. in this systematic review and meta-analysis along with an ecological approach, we found a high percentage of covid-19 patients who suffer from vitamin d deficiency or insufficiency. more importantly, our ecological investigation resulted in substantial direct and reverse correlations between recovery and mortality rate of covid-19 patients with vitamin d status respectively in different countries. considering latitudes, a small reverse correlation between vitamin d status and mortality rate was found throughout the world. altogether, it seems that populations with lower levels of vitamin d might be in higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection. however, further large clinical trials following comprehensive meta-analysis should be taken into account in order to achieve more reliable findings. additionally, due to multiple limitations, if this study does not allow to quantify a "value" of the a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 5 in late 2019, several pneumonia cases with an undetermined cause were identified in wuhan (hubei province, china), and similar cases were rapidly observed in other chinese provinces and other countries [1, 2] . on january 3, 2020, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, sars-cov-2) was isolated from these patients [1] , and the corresponding disease was subsequently named coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) by the world health organization. severe cases, including cases that resulted in death, have been observed in older patients and patients with comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [3] [4] [5] .both sars-cov-1 and sars-cov-2 require human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) to enter the host cell [6, 7] . interestingly, ace2 expression is increased in patients with diabetes [8] and after treatment using renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) inhibitors, such as ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (arbs) [9] . given that mechanism, and the fact that several chinese studies have identified more severe outcomes in covid-19 patients with comorbidities that meet the indications for ace inhibitors and arbs [3] [4] [5] , there are concerns regarding the use of these drugs in covid-19 cases [10] . in addition, sars-cov-2 appears to down-regulate ace2 expression, which is a key enzyme that counteracts raas by degrading angiotensin ii to angiotensin-(1-7) and thereby attenuates organ injury [11] . blockage of raas and increased ace2 expression attenuated lung injury induced by sars-cov in preclinical model [11, 12] . nevertheless, discontinuation of raas inhibitor treatment could lead to clinical deterioration in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and clinical data are lacking regarding the theoretical relationships between raas inhibitor use and covid-19 severity. recent chinese studies demonstrated that inpatient use of raas inhibitors was not associated with mortality in a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 6 covid-19 patients with hypertension [13, 14] . however, prehospital drug use was not evaluated in these studies, thereby questioning adequate exposure to raas inhibitors. therefore, this nationwide population-based cohort study evaluated records from the korean health insurance review and assessment (hira) database to determine whether prior use of raas inhibitors was associated with clinical outcomes among patients with covid-19.limited real-world clinical data are available to physicians and policymakers during the covid-19 pandemic. therefore, the republic of korea's government decided to share the world's first nationwide database of de-identified covid-19 patient data with domestic and international researchers [15] . the database contains claim records (including for a 5-year period before hospitalization) for 69793 individuals who were tested for covid-19 and for whom hospitals issued claims to the hira until april 8, 2020. the database includes detailed information regarding demographic characteristics, diagnoses, prescriptions, procedures, and patient outcomes. the diagnostic codes were assigned on the basis of the korean classification of diseases seventh revision (kcd-7), which is a modified version of the tenth revision of the international classification of diseases (icd-10). use of drugs was identified using anatomical therapeutic chemical codes and hira general name codes. the study protocol for analysis of de-identified patient data was exempted from review by the institutional review board of chung-ang university (1041078-202004-hr-082-01).we included patients with covid-19 who were ≥18 years old. confirmed covid-19 cases were identified using the following kcd-7/icd-10 codes: b34.2 (coronavirus a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 7 infection, unspecified site), b97.2 (coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified to other chapters), u18 (provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology or emergency use), u18.1 (novel coronavirus infection), and u07.1 (coronavirus disease 2019 ). these diagnostic codes were given only if a definitive diagnosis of covid-19 was made based on positive nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays [16] . the index date was defined as the date of the covid-19 diagnosis. all patients were followed until the first instance of death or april 8, 2020.this study identified all raas inhibitors, including ace inhibitors and arbs, that were prescribed within 1 year before the index date. for the present study, raas inhibitor users were defined as patients with raas inhibitor use at 1-30 days before the index date, whereas nonusers were defined as patients who had never received raas inhibitors or had received them at 31-365 days before the index date. a prescription duration of ≥7 days was required to define drug use. the detailed types and codes for raas inhibitors are described in supplementary table 1 .comorbidities were defined on the basis of claim codes within 1 year before the index date and evaluated on the basis of the charlson comorbidity index [17] . the presence of hypertension, which is not included in the charlson comorbidity index, was separately identified using the icd-10 codes (see supplementary table 2 ). data were also collected m a n u s c r i p t 8 regarding previous use of steroids (oral or intravenous for ≥30 days during the previous year) and immunosuppressants (see supplementary table 3 ). immunosuppression was identified on the basis of an underlying disease or condition that affected the immune system (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus infection or malignancy) or if the patient was receiving immunosuppressive therapy. the type of hospital in which a diagnosis of covid-19 has been established was defined according to the center's number of beds and medical specialties (see supplementary material).data were extracted regarding antibiotics, antivirals, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, and vasopressors that were used during the hospitalization (see supplementary tables 3 and   4 ). in-hospital steroid treatment was defined as only intravenous corticosteroid treatment (methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone). vasopressor use was defined as the administration of norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, or dobutamine during the hospitalization. procedure codes were also used to identify cases that involved conventional oxygen therapy, high flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo), and renal replacement therapy (see supplementary table 5 ).in-hospital mortality was defined as the primary study outcome. the secondary outcomes included vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, ecmo, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and acute heart failure).a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 9logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence interval (cis) for in-hospital mortality according to raas inhibitor use. the association of raas inhibitor use with in-hospital mortality was also assessed in the subgroup of patients with hypertension, given the fact that previous studies have identified more severe outcomes in these patients. multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for age, sex, charlson comorbidity index, immunosuppression, and hospital type. a separate analysis was also performed to ascertain the effects of in-hospital medication exposures, vasopressor use, and mechanical ventilation. the rate at which excess ace2 would disappear from host cell membranes after withdrawal of raas inhibitors is unclear. thus, as sensitivity analysis, the patients who received raas inhibitors at any time during the 365 days before the index date were analyzed to compare the clinical outcomes between raas inhibitor users and nonusers. the associations between raas inhibitor use and mortality were assessed on the basis of stratification according to age, sex, charlson comorbidity index, diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and immunosuppression. further, we evaluated whether prior raas inhibitor use was significantly associated with any of the secondary outcomes. all tests were two-tailed and differences were considered statistically significant at p-values of <0.05. all statistical analyses were performed using sas software (version 9.4; sas institute, cary,a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p tamong the 69793 individuals who were tested, 5179 patients were confirmed to have covid-19. these patients with covid-19 were classified as raas inhibitor users (762 patients) or nonusers (4417 patients). 732 users (96%) received arbs, and 110 patients received raas inhibitors at 31-365 days before the index date and were classified as nonusers (see supplementary table 6 ). the patients' baseline characteristics are described in table 1 . the raas inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have the comorbidities listed in table 1 . moreover, raas inhibitor users were more likely to be immunosuppressed.among the 5179 patients with covid-19, hospitalization was observed for 1954 patients (38%). based on the absence of claims data, we assume that the remaining patients stayed at home or received out-of-hospital treatment, such as at community treatment centers.the hospitalized patients included 377 patients who used raas inhibitors and 1577 patients who were nonusers. 365 users (97%) received arbs, and 40 patients received raas inhibitors at 31-365 days before the index date and were classified as nonusers (see supplementary table 6 ). the in-hospital treatments included antibiotics (599 patients, 31%), antivirals (782 patients, 40%), hydroxychloroquine (412 patients, 21%), and intravenous steroids (75 patients, 4%) (see supplementary table 7) . each treatment type was more common among raas inhibitor users.the overall mortality rate for the entire cohort was 1.6% (84/5179 patients), and inhospital mortality was observed for 33/377 raas inhibitor users (9%) and for 51/1577 nonusers (3%) (p<0.001) ( table 2 ). the survival curves for the entire cohort and the hospitalized patients are shown in supplementary figures 1 and 2 table 2) .relative to nonusers, raas inhibitor users were more likely to develop cardiac arrest and acute heart failure, and these observations were not influenced when we evaluated subjects who received raas inhibitors at any time during the 365 days before the index date (see supplementary table 8 ).however, multivariate analysis that adjusted for baseline imbalances revealed that raas inhibitor use was not independently associated with a higher risk of mortality among covid-19 patients (adjusted or, 0.88; 95% ci, 0.53-1.44; p=0.60) ( table 3 ). this finding was not influenced when we evaluated subjects who received raas inhibitors at any time during the 365 days before the index date (see supplementary table 9 ). the analysis that additionally adjusted for in-hospital medications, vasopressor use, and mechanical ventilation was consistent with the overall results (see supplementary table 10 ). the multivariate results were generally consistent across all subgroups (figure 1) , and there were generally no significant differences in the secondary outcomes between the raas inhibitor users and nonusers (table 4) .among the 1157 patients with hypertension and covid-19, there were 719 patients who used raas inhibitors and 438 patients who were nonusers. the raas inhibitor users were more likely to have diabetes, and nonusers were more likely to have malignancy and be immunosuppressed (see supplementary table 11 ). in-hospital mortality was observed for 31/348 raas inhibitor users (9%) and for 25/194 nonusers (13%) (p=0.14) (see supplementary table 12 ). multivariate analysis that adjusted for baseline imbalances revealed that raas inhibitor use was not independently associated with a higher risk of supplementary table 13 ).the present study revealed a significantly higher mortality rate among patients with covid-19 who were using raas inhibitors, relative to patients who were not receiving raas inhibitors. however, raas inhibitor users were older, had more comorbidities, and were more likely to receive in-hospital treatments. the elevated risk of mortality among raas inhibitor users disappeared after adjusting for these confounding factors.the use of raas inhibitors is thought to up-regulate ace2 expression and facilitate host cell entry of sars-cov [6, 7] . furthermore, ace2 is predominantly expressed in lung alveolar epithelial cells and in many extrapulmonary tissues, including the heart and kidneys [18] . however, preclinical models have revealed inconsistent findings regarding the effects of raas inhibitors on ace2 expression [9, 19] . moreover, ace2 may protect against organ injury by reducing angiotensin ii activity, and experimental models have indicated that decreased ace2 activity may contribute to respiratory virus-induced lung injury [20] . a recent study also suggested that patients with covid-19 appeared to exhibit raas activation, increased viral load levels, and subsequent lung injury [21] . the present study revealed that, relative to nonusers, raas inhibitor users had a higher mortality rate and more advanced ventilatory support. nevertheless, the potential for confounding precludes causal inference regarding the relationship between raas inhibitor use and lung injury. in addition, the effects of arbs on ace2 expression are inconsistent in animal models [9, 19] , while ace inhibitors do not affect directly the activity of ace2 [22] . thus, it would be interesting to perform subgroup analysis according to specific raas inhibitors. however, our study had a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 13 a relatively small sample of ace inhibitor users, relative to arb users (see supplementary three chinese studies of patients with severe covid-19 revealed that hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease were the most common comorbidities, and that older age was a risk factor for mortality [3] [4] [5] . an italian cohort of critically ill patients were predominantly older men and hypertension was the most common comorbidity, which was followed by cardiovascular disorders, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes [23] . in korea, the case fatality rate was higher among older men with comorbidities that included cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurologic disease [24] . these poor outcomes are likely related to age-dependent defects in immune function and an excessive host response to viral infection [25] . the protective effects of both sex hormones and a second x chromosome, which carries several genes encoding for innate immune molecules, may explain the low susceptibility of female patients to viral infections [26] . moreover, ace2 is located on the x chromosome, and there is a possibility that the dosage effect of sex chromosome may impact ace2 activity due to escape from x-inactivation [27] . the present study revealed that 22% of patients were ≥60 years old and 44% of patients were men, which are similar to the official statistics from the korea centers for disease control and prevention as of april 5, 2020 (≥60 years old: 24%, men: 40%). we did not separately estimate the individual risk factors for mortality, although it would be reasonable to assume that baseline factors (e.g., age, sex, and comorbidities) did affect the study outcomes, given that the associations with raas inhibitor use disappeared after adjustment for these factors.a c c e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 14 in clinical practice, raas inhibitors are typically used to treat cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [28, 29] . unfortunately, the withdrawal of raas inhibitors may result in severe clinical decompensation in patients with heart failure [30] . in addition, myocardial dysfunction has been observed during the course of covid-19 [31] . dysregulation of ace2 may play a role in myocardial injury, as ace2 knockout in animal models led to angiotensin ii-induced injury and adverse left ventricular remodeling [32] . furthermore, ace2 expression was reduced in viral rna-positive heart samples from patients who died from sars [33] . the present study revealed raas inhibitor users to have higher proportions of vasopressor use, cardiac arrest, and acute heart failure, although these relationships were not significant after adjustment for confounding factors. therefore, our findings suggest that raas inhibitors should be continued in covid-19 patients, especially patients with high risks of heart failure and myocardial infarction. future studies are needed to evaluate the association between raas inhibitor discontinuation and outcomes among covid-19 patients.to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first comprehensive study to evaluate whether prior raas inhibitor use was associated with outcomes in a nationwide cohort of asian covid-19 patients. however, the findings suggest that raas inhibitor use was not independently associated with covid-19 outcomes after adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and in-hospital treatments. these data support the recommendations of major medical societies, which suggest continuation of raas inhibitors in patients with covid-19 [34, 35] . thus, our "real-world" evidence regarding this relationship is crucial, given the concerns regarding ill-advised discontinuation among patients who rely on these drugs [36] . city cohorts [37] [38] [39] . although these studies provide information similar to ours, the evaluation of the associations of raas inhibitors with covid-19-related outcomes in an asian population is clinically relevant, given that the east asian populations have higher ace2 expression in tissues than other populations under the similar conditions [40] .the present study has several limitations. first, the accuracy of diagnostic codes may be limited and there is always a possibility of over-or under-coding. however, the korean hira service vigorously audits insurance claims and numerous peer-reviewed publications have been based on hira data. it is also unlikely that there were discrepancies between the database disease codes and the actual diseases, as epidemic investigations were performed for all covid-19 cases. moreover, raas inhibitors are not available as over-the-counter drugs or via self-pay prescriptions in korea. second, the retrospective observational design cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding and precludes causal inference regarding the relationship between raas inhibitors and covid-19-related outcomes. thus, randomized controlled studies would be needed to establish causality, although it would not likely be feasible to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a short period. thus, observational data are currently the best available evidence regarding raas inhibitor use among patients with covid-19. third, database limitations made it impossible to obtain information regarding a potential control group (e.g., patients who were not sick enough to be tested for covid -19) .in addition, the database did not include information regarding smoking status and laboratory results. nevertheless, our primary objective was to evaluate whether raas inhibitor use was associated with outcomes among patients with covid-19. finally, additional information regarding the cause of death was not available in the database. in this study, the probability of survival dropped abruptly in the first few days for the entire cohort and the hospitalized patients. it is possible that early mortality may be related to acute cardiac event or acute pulmonary embolism rather than covid-19-related respiratory disease. m a n u s c r i p t 25 the novel coronavirus (covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to international health system and economy this study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (covid-19) infections the data on the global outbreak of covid-19, were obtained from world health organization (who), worldometer, centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and research institutes the information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in pub med and institute of scientific information (isi) web of science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to covid-19 infection outbreaks the results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus covid-19 during the period of december 29, 2019 through march 31, 2020, it has infected 750890 people worldwide, resulting in 36405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4 84% the infections were more frequent among male gender with above 60 years of age the mean growth rate index for total number of cases from january 23 to march 31, 2020 was 1 20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1 12 there was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (r2=0 996) the novel coronavirus covid-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide it is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends the global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent the further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe however, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing and movement limitations may control the covid-19 epidemicsbiological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus covid-19 medical education during pandemics: a uk perspectiveaccording to the world heath organization (who), 1,878,489 confirmed cases (119,044 confirmed deaths) of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (2019-ncov) has been reported throughout the world, as of april 15, 2020, including 11,439 confirmed cases (377 deaths) from india [1] . the outbreak was first announced by the "health commission of hubei province", china, a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology (unknown cases) [2] , which is lethal, was first identified in wuhan, the capital city of hubei and seven largest city of china, on december 31, 2019 [3] [4] [5] . later on, the novel coronavirus disease was called officially as covid-19 by who [1] . the epidemic was announced a major public concern worldwide on january 30, 2020 by the world health organization [2] . coronavirus, an enveloped virus described by a single-stranded, positive-sense rna belonging to the family of coronaviridae and the nidovirales order and extensively disseminated among humans as well as mammals [6] . the ongoing coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the world health organization (who) on january 30, 2020, and the govt. of india has announced 21 days nationwide lockdown from march 25, 2020 to april 14, 2020, to prevent stage-iii spreading of the virus or human-to-human transmission.coronavirus causes typically mild infections but sometimes lethal communicable disorders leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) and in present covid-19 pandemic, and in general it can be thought as sarsr-cov [7] , which is mostly observed in bats-could create a future disease outbreak [8, 9] . the most important modes of transmission of coronavirus are respiratory droplets and contact transmission (contaminated hands) and it has incubation period 2-14 days [3, 10] . from the confirmed cases of coronavirus, the symptoms range from fever, sneeze, or even a runny nose, dry cough fatigue breathing problem and lung infiltration to severely ill and dying [10] . shared surfaces are also an important risky since the virus clings on to surfaces and propagates as soon as another person touches the shared surface. the virus also can remain active for about 3 hours after aerosolization (droplets carrying virus mixed with air), on plastic for fifteen hours, and on metallic surfaces for five-six hours.the continuing coronavirus outbreak has been announced a widespread by the world health organization, as of march 16, 2020, the united nations' public health agency has authenticated 1,67,511 confirmed cases, including 6,606 deaths across 151 countries throughout the world [1, 3] .as countries start shutting down borders, cutting off international marketing and quarantining their cial places as well as contacts of cases (quarantine, surveillance, contact tracing) [17] .the route of an outbreak can be described by a series of important factors, but some of which are extremely difficult to understand at present coronavirus disease. the basic reproduction number r 0 is one of the most crucial quantities in infectious diseases, as r 0 measures how contagious a disease is. r 0 designates the number of secondary infections infected by one infected individual in a whole susceptible class, or more specifically the area under epidemic curve. for r 0 < 1, the disease is expected to stop spreading, but for r 0 = 1 an infected individual can infect on an average 1 person, that is, the spread of the disease is stable. the disease can spread and become epidemic if r 0 must be greater than 1. r 0 can help us to understand the effectiveness of the disease, that is, under what condition the disease can stop or spread ? the values for r 0 in china is around 2.5 in the primary stage of the outbreak of coronavirus [18] .the spread of coronavirus outbreak depends on the infectivity of the virus and the availability of susceptible individuals. mathematical modeling play a vital role to better understand the disease dynamics and designing policies to manage quickly spreading infectious diseases in lack of effective vaccine or specific antivirals [19] . recently, many mathematical model have already been studied to understand the complicated dynamics of novel coronavirus, and some of these are cited in our references [3, 5, 12, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . a novel coronavirus model has been established by chen et al. [20] and find the basic reproduction number. imai et al. [21] studied a computational model for novel coronavirus disease 2019 in wuhan, a city of china and their model mainly focused on human-to-human transmission. tang et al. [5] established a compartmental model for coronavirus by incorporating symptomatic ill class to obtain the patients' epidemiological status.they obtained the basic reproduction number 6.47, which is very high for the infectious diseases.nadim et al. [23] studied a mathematical to investigate the coronavirus disease, where they performed stability analysis and they validated their model with the data from hubei, the city of china. their model is originally established by gumel et al. [7] for severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) outbreak. wu et al. [25] established a coronavirus model by considering four classes, namely susceptible, exposed, infected and recovered to study the human-human transmission dynamics based on the data from december 31, 2019 to january 28, 2020. they computed the reproduction number approximately 2.68 for coronavirus disease.the conventional models governing the outbreak of infectious diseases mainly depend on the interplays among susceptible, infected and exposed classes. moreover, the other aspects, such as vaccination, huge news coverage, educational campaigns and rapid information flow can create great psychological effects on the population, and thus remarkably change the publics' behavior and affect the implementation of individuals' intervention and control strategies [26] . it is mainly the awareness program due to media which make the individuals enlighten regarding the disease to take safeguards such as vaccination, wearing protective masks, social distancing etc., to minimize their risks of being infected [27, 28] . how long and how effectual media related impact persists is thus an important issue for future outbreak, and quantifying this impact through a modeling process falls within the scope of our investigation. several mathematical models have been incorporated with the assumption that the media related awareness has an impact on reducing the contact rate of susceptible and infected population [26, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . influenced by those literatures we develop and analyze a mathematical model for coronavirus to study the impact of media related awareness program.to obtain a better insight into the important factors related with the control of novel coronavirus in a community and throughout the world, we investigate a dynamic model to study the epidemic of coronavirus and its control in four mostly affected states, namely maharashtra, delhi, kerala, west bengal and the overall india. we estimated most important parameters, namely β s , ξ a , q a , α h ξ h , ξ i and γ i by using least square method. we calculate the basic reproduction for our model for four different states as well as the india.here, we extend the classical deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (seir) compartmental model refined by introducing contact tracing-hospitalization strategies to study the epidemiological properties of coronavirus . we calibrate our mathematical model using data gained form confirmed cases of coronavirus in india and estimated the basic reproduction number for the disease transmission. in order to make our mathematical model more realistic, we consider the following assumptions:• the model involves a net inflow rate of susceptible individuals λ s per unit time,• the model has no zoonotic infections of coronavirus, considering only the epidemic spread through human beings,• there is no effective control measures before april 10, 2020,• the model involves some demographic effects by accepting a proportional natural mortality in each of the sub-populations.in the underlying dynamic model, the total population n(t) is classified into six subpopulations (classes), namely susceptible s(t), exposed e(t), asymptomatic a(t), clinically ill or symptomatic i(t), hospitalized h(t) and recovered r(t), respectively.the coronavirus outbreaks in the population throughout the world and so the news concerning coronavirus epidemics through different media including television, social networking sites and newspaper as well as educational programs from government, non-government organization and local bodies. the source of information density of media is assumed to be proportional to the number of symptomatic/infective individuals and will alter as the symptomatic population alters.herein, m(t) denotes the cumulative density of media in individual such that m(t) = 0, for i(t) = 0. this is mimic to the mathematical model developed by d'onofrio et al. [27] , in the case of non-delayed model and mimics to the media variable as incorporated there. this media creates the behavioral alteration in the susceptible populations to save themselves from contracting infection. as for example, government of senegal has taken an initiative through sms campaign to spread the information regarding ebola awareness [34] . albeit individuals are informed through media, not everyone responses to it due to insufficiency of resources, irresponsive nature and economic condition etc. therefore a part of susceptible individuals with news regarding coronavirus, responding to the news for corona symptoms and altering their behavior to avoid infection, and will move to the recovered individuals. the rate of behavioral response through media has been considered to be a function of both the densities for susceptible populations and media, that is, f (s(t), m(t)). moreover, we assume that the source of media is a function of i(t), that is, f m (i(t)), as the source of media depends on the density of symptomatic populations. a schematic representation of the above biological mechanism of coronavirus in human upon which our model is based is shown in the figure 1 . the dynamics of novel coronavirus model is governed by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations:the susceptible individual is recruited into the population with a constant inflow rate λ s and decreased by a natural mortality mortality rate δ s . here, β s α a represents the transmission coefficient of the asymptomatic individuals to susceptible, β s α i is the transmission coefficient of symptomatic infected classes to the susceptible, and β s α h denotes transmission coefficient of the hospitalized classes to susceptible population. we consider β s is the disease transmission coefficient for both the infectiousness of covid-19 and contact rates, with adjustment factors α a (for asymptomatic classes), α i (for symptomatic classes) and α h (for hospitalized individuals).albeit, coronavirus is supposed to be spread completely by symptomatic populations, a very lower rate of transmission by asymptomatic populations cannot even be ruled out. the adjustment parameter α a ≥ 0 take into accounts for varying levels of hygiene preventions through asymptomatic, an analogous explanation can be drawn to the adjustment parameters α i and α h during symptomatic and hospitalization, respectively. as the asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalization programmes and hygiene preventions during asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalization were executed and enriched progressively after an epidemic of coronavirus, the spreading coefficients α a β s , α i β s and α h β s , asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalized rates could be modeled as a time-dependent parameters in computations. moreover, the interplay among susceptible and infected population (asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalized) is modeled utilizing standard homogeneous mixing incidence [35, 36] , in the form of total individuals. the rate of change of susceptible individuals can be represented by the following ordinary differential equation (ode):b. dynamics of exposed individuals e(t)the population who are exposed individuals but not yet developed clinical symptoms of coronavirus. the exposed individual is declined by asymptomatic individuals at the rate γ e and natural death at the rate δ e . the constant per-capita rate γ e modeled progression from the exposed individuals (e) to either the asymptomatic individuals (a) or symptomatic individuals (i); the constant q a (0 < q a < 1) represents budget for the rate of progress of population who move to either the asymptomatic partially-infectious class (a) or symptomatic class (i) at the per-capita rate γ e . the corresponding model dynamics for exposed population can be presented by the following ode:asymptomatic populations were exposed to the coronavirus but not infectious for the community.the exposed classes move to the asymptomatic classes at the rate γ e by a constant portion (1 − q a ).the asymptotic individuals progress to the recovered class at the per-capita rate ξ a and natural mortality rate δ a . the rate of change of asymptomatic individuals is govern by the following ode:the symptomatic individuals are produced after the progression of clinical symptoms of coronavirus (diagnosed by the clinicians) by the asymptomatic individuals. the exposed individuals move to the symptomatic classes at the per-capita rate γ e by a constant portion q a . the symptomatic or clinically ill individuals progress to the hospitalized or isolated class (h) at the percapita rate γ i and natural mortality rate δ i . it can be assumed that γ i , the per-capita rate at which symptomatic or clinically ill classes seek clinical attention and are therefore put into the hospitalized class, is bigger than γ e , the per-capita rate at which the exposed individuals progress to the asymptomatic classes. the clinically ill classes (class i) are moved to the recover classes without being diagnosed at the per-capita rate ξ i . the transmission dynamics of symptomatic populations are governed by the following ode: f. dynamics of recovered individuals r(t)it can be assumed that the recovered population have enduring immunity against coronavirus albeit to date this has neither been confirmed nor contradicted. the asymptomatic, symptomatic and hospitalized individuals recover from the coronavirus at the per-capita rates ξ a , ξ i and ξ h , respectively. the recovered individuals die at the per-capita rate δ r . the rate of change of recovered individuals can be written by the ode: we assume that the source of media related information index is proportional to the number of symptomatic individuals. the function f m (i) represents the growth of information index rate, which depend on the symptomatic individuals. while the coronavirus outbreaks, the world health organization (who), health agencies, social media, government and non-government organization become dynamic to spread the information or media awareness in concerning the prevalence of coronavirus.as for the function f m (i), one can consider any function satisfying f m (0) = 0 and f ′ m (i) > 0 [33] . the most easiest example is f m (i) = α m i with α m ∈ (0, 1), that is, i is linear function of the present prevalence of the coronavirus, which could represent for instance current standardized incidence of serious cases of the coronavirus [27] . one more example could be f m (i) = αmi 1+βmi , where i indicates the nonlinear increasing function for the prevalence of the coronavirus, which could be considered as a measure of the perceived risk for the infection rather than the original one [28, 37] . here α m represents the source rate of the information index and β m is half saturation constant. thus, we consider the following ode model for media awareness program:based on the above biological assumptions and schematic representation of coronavirus (see the figure 1 ) together with specific forms, we formulate a mathematical model of novel coronavirus with media awareness given by the following seven-dimensional nonlinear system of odes:the model is satisfied the following positive initial conditions:since the model system (8) monitors the dynamics of human population, all state variables are assumed to be positive.the basic reproduction number, symbolized by r 0 , is 'the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely susceptible population, by a typical infective individual' [38, 39] . the dimensionless basic reproduction number provides a threshold, which play a crucial role in determining the disease persists or dies out from the individual. in a more general way r 0 can be stated as the number of new infections created by a typical infective population at an infection free equilibrium. r 0 < 1 determines on average an infected population creates less than one new infected population during the course of its infective period, and the infection can die out. in reverse way, r 0 > 1 determines each infected population creates, on average, more than one new infection, and the disease can spread over the population. the basic reproduction number r 0 can be computed by using the concept of next generation matrix [38, 39] . in order to do this, we consider the nonnegative matrix f and the non-singular m−matrix v, expressing as the production of new-infection and transition part respectively, for the system (8), are described bythe jacobian matrix for the system (8), can be computed at an infection free state (e = a =represents the spectral radius for a next generation matrix f v −1 . thus, from the system (8), we get the basic reproductiona detailed elucidation on the computer simulations for the coronavirus model system (8) figure 2 designates the prcc results, which implies that the highest positively correlated parameters are the disease transmission coefficient rate β s , proportion rate of exposed individuals q a , the rate ξ h by which the hospitalized class converted to recovered class, the rate α h by which susceptible individuals converted to exposed class and the highly negatively correlated parameters are the rate ξ i by which symptomatic individuals become recovered, the rate γ i by which symptomatic individuals converted to hospitalized class, and the rate ξ a by which the asymptomatic individuals moved to recovered individuals, account for most uncertainty with respect to the symptomatic population. thus, our prcc analysis yields these 7 parameters β s , q a , ξ i , γ i , ξ h , α h and ξ a are the most effective parameters out of 17 parameters.therefore, we estimated the 7 parameters by using least square method.now, we have calibrated our coronavirus disease model (8) table iv ).the output of our model for daily new cases are shown in figure 3 . also, the observed daily new coronavirus cases are overlapped on the fig. 3 . it is also important to observe the total number of coronavirus cases in a province only. so, the observed daily cumulative confirmed coronavirus cases and the model simulation has been plotted in the fig. 4 .to assure the performance of our coronavirus system without media (8) where table iii .the fitting data enables us to quantify the basic reproduction number r 0 from the expression of (10 whereas the slope of the simulated curve is relatively high for the state kerala.to describe how best to diminish human impermanency and morbidity due to novel coronavirus, it is very essential to see the relative significance of various factors responsible for its transmission.the initial disease transmission is completely associated to the reproduction number r 0 , and we calculate the sensitivity indices with regard to r 0 , to the parameters for the system (8). the sensitivity indices describe us whether or not the infectious diseases will develop throughout the individulas. sensitivity analysis is mainly utilized to describe the robustness of the reproduction number r 0 to fluctuation in the system parameters. it also give us to identify the relative change in a state variable when a system parameter alters. the normalized forward sensitivity index for r 0 with respect to the parameter p is defined as follows:as we have the explicit expression for r 0 in (10), we obtain the analytical formulae for sensitivity indices of r 0 , γ r 0 p , to each of fourteen parameters stated in the table vi . as for example, the sensitivity index of r 0 with regards to β s isindependent of any parameters. this represents that r 0 is the increasing function with respect to β s . it implies that the probability of disease transmission has a high impact on coronavirus control and management. other parameters have their sensitivity indices are specified in the table vi .from the table vi , it can be noticed that some of the indices are positive and some of the indices are negative, which indicate that the indices having '+' signs increase the value of r 0 as one increase them and those having '-' signs decrease the value of r 0 , as they are increased.the most sensitive parameter is the disease transmission coefficient β s , where sensitivity index γ r 0 βs = 1 indicates that the increasing β s by 10% will increase r 0 by 10%. also, the sensitivity index of ξ a , that is, γ r 0 βs = − 0.844286 represents that increasing ξ a by 10% will decrease r 0 by 8.44286%. similarly, we can interpret the other parameters too.we plot the sensitivity indices of r 0 , for each of the model parameters using in the table vi has been shown in the figure 6 . in order to control the coronavirus outbreaks, we must target the most sensitive parameters who has the great impact in controlling the system dynamics. for instance, the disease transmission coefficient β s is the most effective parameter in controlling the coronavirus diseases, which can easily be identified from the figure 6 as well as in the table vi. to control the coronavirus outbreaks, the draw the contour plots for the r 0 with respect to the positively correlated parameters, namely disease transmission coefficient β s and the clinical outbreak rate q a for all the infected classes in the figure 7 . the contour plot represents the dependence of r 0 for the four states (kerala, delhi, west bengal, maharashtra) and the republic of india. contour plot indicates that for the higher values of β s and q a the reproduction number r 0 become high, which means the coronavirus may enter the stage-3 and it spread through the community. therefore, to control r 0 must be restrict the values of the transmission coefficient β s and the portion q a by which the exposed class become symptomatically ill. to keep the mortality rate as low as possible, we must be take the values of β s and q a as small as possible. the figure   6 and table vi represents that the adjust factors α a , α i and α h are positively correlated with the basic reproduction number r 0 . thus, we must have to reduce the adjust factors too. thus, we may conclude that to reduce the coronavirus disease outbreak we need to maintain social distancing, limit or stop taking fairs and theaters performances etc.to study the impact of media related awareness for the coronavirus disease we simulate our system (8) for four provinces, namely kerala, maharashtra, delhi, west bengal and the republic of india, with respect to the parameter values specified in the table i we also investigate the media related awareness for the novel coronavirus diseases for the republic of india and four provinces, namely kerala, maharashtra, west bengal and delhi, with respect to parameters listed in the table i and rest of the estimated parameters listed in the table   ii with initial individuals are listed in the table iv . the impact of media awareness effect for the daily cumulative confirmed cases of coronavirus diseases for symptomatic classes are shown in the to study the future outbreaks of coronavirus diseases, we simulate our system (8) for a long days of the infected individuals, namely asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic or clinically ill individuals for the parameters are listed in the table i and we have considered the estimated   parameters for the table ii in case of indian data only with initial population sizes are given in the table iv . the model simulation represented that the people from overall india can experience future epidemics if the control policies are not implemented more effectively, as shown in the figure 10 . the number of infected individuals (asymptomatic and symptomatic) are oscillate around 130 days and around 320 days. this can be interpreted as the reproduction number r 0 is always greater than unity in india (see the table v for india) . otherwise, we can say that the impact of media related awareness is a dynamic process and the media has a great impact in reducing the transmission of coronavirus outbreaks at the initial stage of an epidemic. the factors like low air temperature and as well low humidity has a great impact on the transmission of novel coronavirus [11] . moreover, to control the future outbreaks of novel coronavirus the media related awareness programme and the control strategy must be implemented properly. in this manuscript, we propose a compartmental epidemic model on novel coronavirus diseases by incorporating the effect of media awareness to predict and control the outbreak. in our model we noted that media awareness play a key role in generating public consciousness and encouraging disease measures [42] . in our proposed model, we consider two infectious individuals, namely asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with former being a fast spreader of the coronavirus diseases. our model formulation is based on the work by gumel et al. [7] , where we estimate the system parameters based on the prcc sensitivity analysis at an early stage of the outbreak, in which the number of cumulative classes grow exponentially.we calibrated the proposed model to fit with the data from four different states, namely maharashtra, kerala, delhi, west bengal and the republic of india. the most important part is to perform the sensitivity analysis of 17 model parameters and its estimation. to identify the key input parameters which contributed to the symptomatic outcome, strongly assisted the implementation of an integrated policy for various measures, involving the epidemic during different phases of the diseases, we use the sensitivity analysis by using prcc techniques. prcc analysis yields the most sensitive parameters are β s , q a , γ i , α h , ξ a and ξ h out of 17 input parameters without incorporating media impact. then we estimated these 7 parameters based on the data from four different states and from the entire india. by fitting data on novel coronavirus cases during january 30, 2020 to march 31, 2020, in the four different states of india and the overall india to our proposed model, we were able to get estimates of the unknown parameters for our system.by fitting our proposed model (simply the classical model without considering media impact) system (8) with real data obtained from india covid-19 tracker (https://www.covid19india.org/), we were able to get acceptable estimations for the system parameters and curve fitting, as shown in the figures 3 and 4 . to ensure the performance of our system without media, we compute the numerical errors, namely e m ae and e rm se . within the reasonable set of parameters, the model simulations without incorporating media awareness, obtained relatively good fits to novel coronavirus data, as plotted in the figures 3 and 4 .from the basic reproduction number r 0 in table v , it can be compared that the province kerala is highly effective by coronavirus diseases compare to other three provinces and the republic of india. nevertheless, our model-based analysis also demonstrates that the basic reproduction number in india and four different provinces remains greater than unity. the estimation of basic reproduction number r 0 indicates that the strengthen control involvements are mandatory to reduce and/or eradicate the future coronavirus diseases. thus, in this scenario the public must have to give utmost priority to stay home quarantine and successful the lock-down to combat against coronavirus pandemic. in this situation, media related awareness is mandatory to aware each and every people such that they can maintain social distancing, wear mask to protect themselves and avoid cultural programme.from the sensitivity indices (see table vi and the figure 6 ) for the basic reproduction number r 0 , we observed that the disease transmission coefficient β s and the portion q a clinical outbreak rates in all infected classes are positively correlated with r 0 . this indicates that to reduce coronavirus diseases the social distancing is the most important factor and we reduce the values for β s and q a to control the diseases. as we know, for r 0 < 1 the diseases can be died out. thus, to keep control the value of r 0 we must reduce β s and q a . while investigating the contour plot, we observe that for the lower values for β s and q a , the reproduction number can be controlled and reduced to less than unity, as shown in the figure 7 . thus, if we are able to control the social distancing, then we are able to control the basic reproduction number r 0 and hence we are able to eradicate the coronavirus diseases. since r 0 quantifies the initial epidemic transmission, its sensitivity indices enable us to establish the relative significance of various parameters in coronavirus transmission.from the sensitivity of basic reproduction number r 0 , we can conclude that the most effective control measures are the isolation of all close contacts and strengthening the self-protection ability for susceptible individuals. (table ii) thus, our calibrated model predicted that the increasing pattern of coronavirus diseases will be continued if the people not aware about the diseases. thus, the public must have to take the precautions and the health care agencies should concentrate on successful implementation of control mechanisms to reduce and/or eradicate the disease.in order to study the long-term dynamics of our model, we observed the most interesting switching phenomena, as plotted in the figure 10 . maybe this is happen due to the impact of media awareness as it is a dynamic process on disease epidemic. also, the media awareness has a good impact in mitigating the disease transmission at an initial stage of an epidemic. it is worthy to mention that the media impact is not always remain efficacious for mitigating disease transmission throughout the epidemic [43] . a detailed understanding of media awareness during an outbreak can help in the progression of an implementable public health strategy. a particular interest to the designers of such strategies are the effects of media awareness on some significant epidemic features such as the size of the peak, its timing and the whole number of diseases. our proposed model and its simulation, like those in earlier investigations [26-33, 37, 42, 43] , allow that quantifying these media effects gives additional insights.our model simulation and prediction suggests that the novel coronavirus diseases has a potentiality to exhibit oscillatory dynamics in the future but can be controllable by maintaining social distances and effectiveness of isolation or hospitalization. our model forecasts that isolation or hospitalization of populations with coronavirus symptoms, under stringent hygiene safeguards and social distancing, be able to effectual control in a community and may even eliminate the diseases.our study also suggests that the size and duration of an epidemic can be considerably affected by timely implementation of the hospitalization or isolation programme. based on the model simulations and prediction to control the coronavirus diseases, we provide some particular inferences to face with emerging diseases:i. avoidance of mass gatherings, rallies, social distancing and implement extensive lock-down;ii. provide essential personal safeguard to the staff who are involved in emergency services;iii. timely give the statistics of the coronavirus diseases to the community, including the number of asymptomatic cases, symptomatic cases, hospitalized cases and so on;iv. increase the media awareness to aware the population, organize the targeted health care education and self-protection and remove the public mental disorder. table i and rest of parameters are estimated and   taken from the table ii for different states and overall india. the initial values are taken from the table iv .

humans. this coronavirus belongs to the genus β and has an envelope; its particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, and 60 to 140 nm in diameter. the genetic characteristics of sars-cov-2 are significantly different from those of sars-cov and mers-cov. current research shows that sars-cov-2 has more than 85% homology with bat sars-like coronavirus (bat-sl-cov zc45). 2 therefore, it is now believed that the original host of sars-cov-2 may have been rhinolophus sinicus. 3 8 post hoc investigations also revealed that there was a wildlife trade in this market, and sars-cov-2 has also been isolated from the market's environment. human-to-human transmission emerged shortly thereafter. 9 patients with covid-19 have become the main source of infection.covid-19 may be capable of transmission during the incubation period. 10, 11 these patients are difficult to diagnose and isolate in time, which causes great difficulties in the prevention and control of the disease. however, up to date, there is no enough evidence to support the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of covid-19. in addition, the presence of the virus can be detected in patients during the recovery stage, especially in fecal specimens requiring longer detoxification times, indicating the possible risk of fecal-oral transmission. 11 sars-cov-2 is a positive-stranded rna virus that is susceptible to gene mutation and recombination, but so far, no significant mutations have been found in humans or the environment. 2, 12 3 | method of spread at present, droplets inhaled into the respiratory tract and contact transmission are considered to be the most important routes of transmission. there is no direct evidence showing that covid-19 can be transmitted through aerosols. the who believes that further evidence is needed to assess the possibility of aerosol transmission.however, some of the observations suggest that aerosol propagation is possible under the condition of long exposure to high concentrations of aerosols in a relatively closed environment. in the early stages of the outbreak of sars-cov-2 pneumonia, it is uncertain whether stool samples from patients are infectious. however, lu et al, 2 using a computer structural simulation, found that the s-protein of sars-cov-2 can bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) in the spatial conformation. after that, letko et al 13 synthesized the s-protein of sars and the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of sars-cov-2 in vitro and reacted with known human coronavirus receptors, respectively. as a result, the rbd of sars-cov-2 is similar to the s protein in sars, and it can directly bind to human ace2. ace2 is a metalloproteinase belonging to a type i transmembrane glycoprotein, and it can be expressed in the small intestine. 14, 15 in our laboratory, it was also found that nucleic acid amplification testing of stool samples can still be positive for a long time after oral swab samples become negative. in addition, a large number of clinical studies have shown that a certain proportion of sars-cov-2 pneumonia patients develop symptoms of diarrhea. 10, 16 it can be concluded that during the development of the disease, there is a greater possibility of the virus in the stool. recently, sars-cov-2 has been isolated from the stool of confirmed patients in wuhan and shenzhen, china, and in the united states, 17 indicating that the virus can replicate and survive in the digestive tract. however, it is not clear whether the infection and transmission are caused by eating food contaminated with the virus. through the analysis of the current epidemic situation, some scholars believe that viruses in feces may be retransmitted by the aerosol formation of virus-containing droplets. sars-cov-2 also has adverse effects on fetuses and infants, including restricted intrauterine growth, premature birth, spontaneous abortion, and perinatal death. 18 however, the possibility of intrauterine mother-to-child transmission of covid-19 is very low, and neither of the two existing retrospective clinical studies have found direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission. 19, 20 those in close contact with patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia, including the family members of patients, are at high risk for developing the sars-cov-2 infection. medical staff who treat patients also have a high risk of infection. nine percent of the patients admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university from 1 to 28 january 2020, were the medical staff. 22 by the end of 29 january 2020, survey data from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces in china showed that the infection rate of medical staff was as high as 2.09%. 16 according to a who report, as of 23 march 2020, the world has according to the available data, the mortality rate of covid-19 in china is lower than those of sars (10%) 23 and mers (40%). 24 by 23 march 2020, 96.5% (3160/3276) of the deaths caused by sars-cov-2 pneumonia in china was in hubei province, and the earlier the onset of disease was, the higher the mortality rate, suggesting that the pathogenicity may gradually decrease as the virus spreads, which may also occur because of the improving ability of medical staff to diagnose and treat the disease. the national health commission of china notified on 4 february 2020, that the population is generally susceptible to the virus, and more than 80% of the deaths are elderly people over 60 years old; at the same time, more than 75% of the deaths have underlying diseases. overall, men are linked to a higher risk of death. the specific data in this section are shown in table 1 others were all in mild condition. among the seven cases reported in the existing literature outside china, except for one case where the patient died, the remaining cases were in stable condition (table 3) .according to the latest data as of 23 march 2020, more than found that about 0.1% of patients will be tested positive for nucleic acid again after discharge. 50 there are many reasons for the positive nucleic acid test of discharged patients. 51 the reagent itself, detection method, sampling method, and so on will affect the positive rate.in addition, the possibility of disease recurrence cannot be ruled out too. genomic analysis of the virus from different regions, different periods and different sources of patients revealed that sars-cov-2was stable and showed no major variation. so once the patient is cured with immunity against the virus, there is little chance of reinfection. the detection of sars-cov-2 specific igm and igg antibodies is an effective means to determine whether a patient has immunity against sars-cov-2. but these patients still have the potential to infect others. therefore, after the patient is discharged from the hospital, it is recommended to continue the isolation management and health condition monitoring for 14 days. here are some tips and considerations for self-isolation: wear a mask, live in a single room with good ventilation, reduce close contact with family members, separate meals, good hand hygiene, and avoid outdoor activities. it is also recommended to visit the hospital for reexamination on the 14th and 28th days after discharge.in the early stages of the epidemic, the chinese government adopted the principles of "four early" and "four centralization" to address the epidemic so that the epidemic situation was effectively controlled.the so-called "four early" principle is early detection, early reporting, early isolation, and early treatment. early detection and isolation of sars-cov-2-infected people, moving the prevention and control barrier forward, accelerating the grid-based management of the community, improving detection capabilities, optimizing the diagnosis and treatment process, and shortening the diagnosis time can effectively block the spread of the epidemic and reduce the infection rate. the principle of "four centralization" is to centralize patients, centralize experts, centralize resources, and centralize treatment.patients with severe illness are centralized at the best hospital with the strongest comprehensive capacity for treatment. at the same time, to centralize resources and experts to treat critically ill patients, multidisciplinary and comprehensive individualized diagnosis and treatment are applied in accordance with "one person, one strategy,"and finally, the mortality rate is effectively reduced.in addition, more than 37 000 medical staff from other parts of china participated in the treatment of patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia in wuhan, hubei, which fully reflects the noble qualities and good professionalism of chinese medical staff.it has not been long since the occurrence of sars-cov-2 pneumonia,there are relatively few reports in the literature, and some opinions need to be further verified by multicenter big data. in addition, infectious diseases have different characteristics at different stages.whether some of the findings and opinions have always been applicable needs further evaluation.the sars-cov-2 originated from the huanan seafood market in china has now been controlled and has gradually improved.this study was supported by the zhejiang university special scientific research fund for covid-19 prevention and control.the authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.dr. ss and qs had full access to all of the data in the study and takes in december 2019, clusters of acute pneumonia cases of unclear etiology were identified in wuhan city, the capital of hubei province in china [1–3]. the pathogen has been reported as a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). the world health organization (who) has made the assessment that coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) can be characterized as a pandemic because the disease is still spreading rapidly around the world, especially in the united states, spain, and russia [4]. as of may 26, a total of 82993 cases (4634 deaths) were confirmed in china, including 50340 cases (3869 deaths) in wuhan city [5].the national health commission of china has issued a series of diagnosis and treatment recommendations and suggested classifying the disease into four grades: mild, moderate, severe and critical [5]. recent studies have reported the clinical characteristics and prognosis of the varied severity grades of covid-19 [1, 2, 6–8]. the underlying mechanisms of the novel coronavirus leading to disease exacerbation and organ dysfunction remain to be further explored. due to the high mortality and the lack of effective treatments in critically ill patients [7, 9], early identification and prediction of these patients are crucial. what are the risk factors for severe illness or death [10]? how can we identify groups that are most likely to have poor outcomes so that we can focus prevention and treatment efforts [10]? these studies are needed. huang et al [8] reported that patients admitted to the intensive care unit (icu) had more severe clinical symptoms and more abnormal serum parameters. however, fewer studies have been published that confirm an early and sensitive biomarker to estimate the disease severity and prognosis of covid-19. during our clinical work against the covid-19 epidemic in wuhan, we observed a high incidence of hypocalcemia in critically ill patients. therefore, we hypothesized that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19. this study was performed to test this hypothesis and explore the causes of hypocalcemia.the median serum calcium levels were 2.12 (iqr, 2.04-2.20) mmol/l on admission. we divided the patients into three groups based on the serum calcium values: ≤2.0 mmol/l (defined as group a, n = 43), 2.0-2.2 mmol/l (defined as group b, n = 137), and >2.2 mmol/l (defined as group c, n = 61). as shown in table 2, significant differences in the clinical variables except for serum creatinine were found among the three groups, and the same differences were found between groups a and b (p <0.05). there were also differences in the clinical variables except for wbc count (p =0.07) and serum creatinine (p =0.244) between groups a and c, whereas differences in the variables except for wbc count (p =0.60), alt (p =0.839), the lowest spo2 (p =0.328), and serum creatinine (p =0.635) were found between groups b and c. these results indicated that patients with lower serum calcium levels had worse clinical variables.of the 241 patients, 26 were tested to determine levels of parathyroid hormone (pth) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin d (vd) according to clinical needs. the median serum calcium level of the 26 patients was 2.13 (iqr, 2.03-2.16) mmol/l. the median pth level was 55.27 (iqr, 42.73-73.15) pg/ml, and the median vd level was 10.20 (iqr, 8.20-12.65) ng/ml. all of these patients had low levels of vd (vd deficiency).the spss scatterplots and correlation analyses of serum calcium and the blood biomarkers are shown in figures 1 and 2. the serum calcium levels were significantly positively correlated with lymphocyte count (figure 1a, p <0.001), albumin levels (figure 1b, p <0.001), vd levels (figure 1c, p =0.004), and lowest spo2 (figure 1d, p< 0.001), whereas they are significantly negatively correlated with crp (figure 2a, p< 0.001), d-dimer (figure 2b, p< 0.001) and pth (figure 2c, p =0.048) levels. these results indicated that hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19.ards developed in 19 of 241 (7.9%) patients, and liver injury developed in 16 (6.6%), aki developed in 14 (5.8%), and cardiac injury developed in 12 (5.0%) patients during the research period. twelve patients received mv, and 7 patients received crrt. as shown in table 3, significant differences in the clinical severity and outcome variables were found among the abovementioned three groups (a, b, and c) (p <0.001) and between groups a and c (p <0.001). there were also differences in all these variables except for liver injury incidence (p =0.201). no differences were found between groups b and c (p >0.05). these results indicated that patients with serum calcium values ≤2.0 mmol/l had higher 28-day mortality, and a higher incidence of organ injury. moreover, the serum calcium values were significantly lower in patients who died and in patients with mods, septic shock, and organ injury, requiring mv or crrt (p <0.001) (table 4).roc curves were also performed to assess the associations between serum calcium and mods, septic shock, and 28-day mortality. as shown in figure 3, the area under the curves (aucs) of mods (figure 3a), septic shock (figure 3b), and 28-day mortality (figure 3c) were 0.923 (p <0.001), 0.905 (p =0.001), and 0.929 (p <0.001), respectively. optimal cut-off points of serum calcium values were derived from the roc curves. the optimal cut-off point for mods was 2.035 mmol/l, the sensitivity was 88.2%, and the specificity was 82.6%. the optimal cut-off point for septic shock was 2.01 mmol/l, the sensitivity was 100.0%, and the specificity was 84.3%. the optimal cut-off point for 28-day mortality was 2.01 mmol/l, the sensitivity was 100.0%, and the specificity was 85.7%. figure 4 shows the significant differences in the 28-day mortality among groups a, b, and c. the 28-day mortality of group a was significantly higher than that of groups b or c (p <0.001). no difference was found between groups b and c (p >0.05).this clinical retrospective study investigated the correlations between serum calcium and clinical severity and outcomes in patients with covid-19. the incidence of hypocalcemia was 74.7%. we found that patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially ≤2.0 mmol/l) had worse clinical variables, higher incidences of mods and septic shock, and higher 28-day mortality. hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19. the overall mortality was 4.1% (10/241), whereas the mortality of critically ill patients was increased to 40.0% (10/25).the who declared that covid-19 was a pandemic because the disease is still spreading rapidly around the world [4]. more than 5700000 patients have been diagnosed with covid-19 worldwide, and nearly 360000 have died [4]. although the national health commission of china and the who have issued a series of diagnosis and treatment recommendations, the mortality of critically ill patients is still extremely high. the underlying mechanisms of the novel coronavirus causing organ dysfunction are yet unknown. it is crucial to identify the risk factors for severe illness or death [10]. however, few reports have been published to establish an early and sensitive biomarker to predict the disease severity and prognosis of covid-19. in this study, we found that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19.hypocalcemia is common in critically ill patients. the causes of hypocalcemia include oversecretion of pth, vd deficiency, decreased dietary intake, hypoproteinemia, hypomagnesemia drug interactions, and so on [15]. hypocalcemia was defined as a serum calcium level less than 2.2 mmol/l in our clinical laboratory. at present, there is no specific severity grading system for hypocalcemia. previous studies reported that serum calcium levels less than approximately 2.0 mmol/l were associated with worse clinical outcomes in critically ill patients [15–17]. therefore, we divided patients into three groups based on serum calcium values of ≤2.0 mmol/l, 2.0-2.2 mmol/l, and >2.2 mmol/l. we found that patients with serum calcium values ≤2.0 mmol/l had higher 28-day mortality, and a higher incidence of organ injury. the findings of this study were consistent with previous reports. however, this was the first study to investigate the correlations between serum calcium and clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19. these results suggested that correcting hypocalcemia could be an important strategy to improve the prognosis of patients with covid-19, especially for patients with serum calcium values less than 2 mmol/l. in addition, our study also revealed that hypocalcemia was associated with hypoproteinemia and imbalanced vd and pth in the acute phase of covid-19. hypoproteinemia and vd deficiency were also common and correlated with increased mortality in critically ill patients [18, 19]. therefore, improvement of hypoproteinemia and imbalanced hormone levels may also be useful in the treatment of covid-19.increased crp, alt, tni, and d-dimer levels and lymphocytopenia were present in most critical covid-19 patients [2, 7, 8]. our results also showed that patients with lower serum calcium values had higher levels of crp, alt, tni, and d-dimer and lower lymphocyte counts. the serum calcium values were significantly correlated with lymphocyte count and crp and d-dimer levels. moreover, crp and d-dimer were also indicators to predict the prognosis of critically ill patients [19]. the findings of this study were consistent with previous reports and confirmed that serum calcium levels were associated with the disease severity and prognosis of patients with covid-19. the lung is the main organ affected by this disease. in this study, the median lowest spo2 was 97.0% (iqr, 96.0%-98.0%; range, 80%-99%), and the spo2 values were significantly positively correlated with serum calcium levels. patients with serum calcium values ≤2.0 mmol/l had higher ards incidence, while patients with ards also had lower serum calcium values. these phenomena indicated that hypocalcemia might be crucial in the development of ards. early diagnosis and treatment of hypocalcemia may alleviate organ injury in the acute phase of covid-19.some limitations of the study should be discussed. because of our single-center retrospective design and small sample size, the results might be inconclusive, and the accuracy should be confirmed by large-scale prospective clinical studies. moreover, because the study was not based on pathophysiological models, the results were hypothesis generating, and the exact mechanisms of hypocalcemia and vd deficiency should be tested by more fundamental experiments. in addition, the values of serum calcium were of total calcium rather than ionized calcium in this study, which may not precisely reflect the extent of decreased calcium.in conclusion, this retrospective clinical study found that the incidence of hypocalcemia and vd deficiency was very high in patients with covid-19. hypocalcemia may be associated with imbalanced vd and pth levels. patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially ≤2.0 mmol/l) had worse clinical variables, higher incidences of mods and septic shock, and higher 28-day mortality. the overall mortality of covid-19 was 4.1%, whereas the mortality of critically ill patients was 40.0%.from february 10 to february 28, 2020, adult patients (age ≥18 years) with confirmed covid-19 admitted to our specialized isolation units, tongji hospital of huazhong university of science and technology in wuhan, were enrolled in this clinical retrospective study. patients with chronic organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic or renal dysfunction), terminal cancer, immunodeficiency, and a history of long-term use of hormones were excluded. written informed consent was waived by our institutional review board because this was a retrospective study that assessed deidentified data and included no potential risk to patients. the diagnosis of covid-19 was made according to the who interim guidance and the recommendations of the national health commission of china [4, 5], and confirmed by rna detection of sars-cov-2 in the clinical laboratory of tongji hospital.an identified case of covid-19 was defined as a positive finding by real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens [4, 5, 7]. only laboratory-confirmed cases were enrolled in the analysis. the clinical classifications of covid-19 were in accordance with the chinese recommendations [5]: mild, with minor clinical symptoms (e.g., fever, cough) without imaging manifestations. moderate, with fever or respiratory tract infection symptoms with imaging indicating pneumonia. severe, met any of the following, i—respiratory distress and respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min; ii—pulse oxygen saturation (spo2) ≤93% at rest; or iii—arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pao2)/ fraction of inspired oxygen (fio2) ≤300 mmhg (1 mmhg =0.133 kpa). critical, met any of the following, i—respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation (mv); ii—shock; or iii—multiple organ failure requiring icu treatment. hypocalcemia was defined as a serum calcium level less than 2.2 mmol/l in our clinical laboratory. sepsis was defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, and septic shock was defined as a subset of sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality [11]. the diagnostic criteria of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) were in accordance with the berlin definitions [12]. the definitions of acute kidney injury (aki) were based on the 2012 kidney disease: improving global outcomes (kdigo) guidelines [13]. cardiac injury was defined if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin i) were more than twice the reference upper limit or new abnormalities were found in electrocardiography and echocardiography [2]. liver injury was defined if serum levels of hepatic biomarkers (e.g., alanine aminotransferase) were more than twice the reference upper limit or if there was disproportionate elevation of alanine aminotransferase (alt) and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels [14]. multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (mods) was defined as the combined dysfunction of two or more organs.the baseline clinical characteristics, including age, sex, days from onset to admission, initial symptoms or signs, and clinical classifications were collected from electronic medical records, and all laboratory tests were performed according to the clinical needs of patients. the levels of serum calcium, c-reactive protein (crp), alt, albumin, creatinine, troponin i (tni), and plasma d-dimer and white blood cell (wbc) count, lymphocyte count, and the lowest spo2 within 24 hours of admission were recorded. the hormone levels associated with blood calcium (e.g., parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy-vitamin d) were also recorded. all blood parameters were detected by the clinical laboratory of tongji hospital. moreover, the numbers of patients with ards, aki, cardiac injury, liver injury, septic shock and mods and patients receiving noninvasive ventilation (niv), high-flow nasal cannula (hfnc), mv, and continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt) were also recorded. the primary endpoints were the development of septic shock, mods, and 28-day mortality. the secondary endpoints were the other disease severity parameters (e.g., organ injury or not).the kolmogorov-smirnov test was first performed to test the normal distribution of the data. normally distributed data were expressed as the means ± standard deviation and were compared by t tests. abnormally distributed data were expressed as the medians (interquartile ranges, iqr) and were compared by the mann-whitney u test or the kruskal-wallis test. categorical variables were presented as absolute numbers or percentages and were analyzed using the χ2 test or fisher’s exact test. to take into account the repeated nature of the variables, analysis of variance (anova) for repeated measurements of the general linear model was implemented. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were used to evaluate the associations between serum calcium and septic shock, mods, and 28-day mortality. ibm statistical package for the social sciences (spss, version 22.0, ny, usa) software was used for statistical analysis, and p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. spss scatterplots and a correlation analysis were performed to evaluate the relevance between serum calcium and blood biomarkers. the statistical methods of this study were reviewed by qiao liu, a biostatistician from the center for disease control and prevention of jiangsu province in china.india is a fraction to that seen in western countries. india's recovery rate from covid-19 is higher than those of many nations at the same level of infection and can be due to high suspicion of diagnosis, timely detection, and treatment. the possible reasons behind lower mortality figures in india is ambiguous, with many theories described for this. we try to elucidate various reasons for lower mortality rate in the indian subcontinent due to covid-we have investigated and identified the possible reasons and hypotheses for this disparity in mortality on several parameters as below and shall discuss them in some details.it is acknowledged that the elderly population makes up a high proportion of the covid-19 mortality across all countries [2, 3] . the western natives are significantly older than their asian and african counterparts. india is a young nation. according to a report by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation the share of its youth is expected to be 34.33% of the total population of india by 2020 [4] . availability of universal health care and the social culture of family ties and protection of the elderly in india support high self-rated health amongst elders [5] .certain immune variations such as genetic or acquired differences might separate people who fall severely ill and develop pneumonia with covid-19 from those who contract the infection but hardly develop any discernible symptom [6] . such differences in fatality rates could be linked to genetic variations in sars-cov-2, but the current literature pertaining to this is lacking. individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to a virus across a population. in particular, understanding how variation in hla may affect the course of covid-19 could help identify individuals at higher risk from the disease [7] .studies have found that higher mortality rate in western countries is due to genetics. the cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (s) proteins to cellular receptors (sars-cov-2 receptor ace2)and on s protein priming by host cell proteases (serine protease tmprss2). the mechanisms of sars-cov-2 infection have been explained by a recent study that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) responsible for the cleavage of angiotensin i and angiotensin ii as the host cell surface receptor allowing for the viral infection covid-19. sars-cov-2 infection causes decrease of ace2 expression leading to severity of the lung damage [8] . the presence of d allele of ace1 genes is associated with a reduced expression of ace2 genes, which results in fewer ace2 receptors thus lower chance of infection but increasing the severity of lung damage. this d/i polymorphism shows an important geographical variation. low d allele frequencies have been reported in asians as compared to the european population and could be the cause of more severe pulmonary infection due to covid-19 and deaths [9] .the hla gene variant has been tied to high rates of severe symptoms of severe adult respiratory syndrome (sars), a coronavirus related to covid-19. the occurrence and development of sars-cov-2 depend on the interaction between the virus and the individual's immune system [10] . the genes responsible for proteins that prevent the immune system from attacking the body itself come in several variants. it has been shown that people with some variants are more susceptible to the corona virus than those with the others and that these variants may be specific by region [11] .an indo-us team of researchers has found that indians, compared to other world populations, carry more natural killer cells that can detect and terminate infections at an early stage [12] .mutations are a part of the natural life cycle of any virus. the indian council of medical research (icmr), the apex health research body of india, is planning to study the genetic diversity of the virus to study the evolution of sars-cov-2 and to evaluate, if the present strain has evolved or is the same as the initial strain. it has been believed that higher mortalities seen in some of indian regions may be due to a mutant, more virulent strain of the researchers at cambridge university found that the virus may have mutated as it spreads from asia to europe becoming more resilient to conditions in europe and thus, deadlier however, not enough data is available on different strains [14] . the study identifies three strains of virus a, b and c ; type a is prevalent in us and australia , type b wuhan's major virus type, 'b', is prevalent in patients from across east asia, c' variant, is the major european type, found in early patients from france, italy, sweden and england [14] . there are some suggestions that temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the covid-19 mortality [17, 18] . coronavirus spread is slow in hot and humid weather and spreads easily in dry and cold conditions [19] . warmer asian countries saw the infection spread more slowly than europe and the us. with the start of summer in india and with temperatures more than 35 to 40 degrees centigrade, the infection rate has not been coming down, indicating that this may not be such a relevant factor.high infection and death rate due to covid 19 can also be due to stringency of lockdown.usa, sweden, iran,and turkey did not implement strict curbs and have high rates of mortality. india's 21 days of complete national wide lockdown was one of the most stringent in the world for keeping the number of cases down [20] . the current low levels of mortality are surely a pointer of what happened before the lockdown began. it is also possible that covid-19 has had a substantial mortality impact, but that the total deaths have not risen because the complete lockdown reduced non-covid deaths. recent unlocking of restrictions in india has seen a rise in the numbers of reported infections and mortality [21] .lack of bcg vaccination has been claimed to be apossible explanation for the high heterogeneity of infection/mortality rates across involved countries.the widespread use of bcg vaccination for prevention of tuberculosis (tb) in india may be the reason for lower rates of covid-19. the bcg vaccine is an approved vaccine product by the fda for people who have not been previously infected with mycobacteriumtuberculosis and who are at a high risk of being infected with this bacillus. it appears that in countries with routine bcg vaccination, the pandemic appears to be less severe as this vaccine is a general immunesystem enhancer. the bcg vaccination has been given to indian children since 1948.countries without universal policies of bcg vaccination (italy, netherland,usa) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing bcg policies.countries that have a late start of universal bcg policy (iran, 1984) have had high mortality in elderly population. hence this explanation demands more in-depth research and explanation [22] . bcg vaccine is currently being trialed to reduce the frequency and severity of covid-19 [23] . it is hoped that the vaccine will increase the trained immunity, so that the immune system is boosted against coronavirus sars-cov-2.indians suffer repeated attacks of respiratory viruses that keep their immune system primed; destroying pathogens, attempting to attack,could be one important factor (this has probably also provided prevention from sars and mers-cov). nutritional factors, tough life, unhygienic conditions, poor community hygiene etc. may also be responsiblefor repeated respiratory infections [24] .obesity rates are higher in the us and the western world than in india. the prevalence of obesity in the usa around 40%, versus a prevalence of 6·2% in china, 20% in italy, and 24% in spain [25] a recent study has demonstrated that hospitalized patients younger than 50 with morbid obesity (bmi ≥40 kg/m2) are more likely to die from covid-19 [26] . patients with obesity are associated with impaired immune response, endothelial dysfunction, decreased functional residual capacity in the lungs and hypoxemia and expression of ace2 in adipose tissue which has high affinity to the sarcov2 virus [27, 28] .the effects of covid-19 on the health of racial and ethnic minority groups are still emerging; however, current data suggest a disproportionate burden of illness and death in this cohort [29] . factors that influence racial and ethnic minority group health, include economic and social conditions. these groups also find it difficult to access resources during outbreaks such as covid-19. racial residential segregation and living in densely populated areas does notallow principles of social distancing and underlying health conditions [30] . as such, scientific studies that result in improved understanding of covid-19 may lead to more targeted and effective community and health care system-based interventions in the future.hence, analyzing the disproportionate affliction of the black and ethnic minority group will be essential [31] .the covid-19 pandemic struck india in early march i.e. later than in other countries and hence there is a substantial delay in the reported infections and fatality in india. the spread to all countries from china was almost simultaneous. india's response was initiated on 8th january, much before who declared covid-19 as a public health emergency. the screening of travelers from abroad at airports and at ports was started exceedingly early in jan 2020. all incoming travellers, including indian nationals, arriving from, or having visited china, italy, iran, republic of korea, france, spain, and germany after 15th february 2020 were quarantined for a minimum period of 14 days [33] . however, in many other countries (the usa, uk, and eu countries) did not resort to any such measures.anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine was suggested to reduce the covid-19 risk in health workers with potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity.this drug has diverse modes of action, including inhibition of cytokine storms in the host cell which work against the viral infections and help prevent deaths. [34] the recent study found that covid-19 infections are higher in countries where malaria islessendemic and lower in countries where malaria is highly endemic. large numbers of mortality in health care professionals acrossthe globe have been observed during pandemic. [35] in india; indian council of medical research (icmr) recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine in asymptomatic health professionals who cared for suspected or confirmed covid-19 casesearly in the rise of the pandemic; this may have prevented more fatalities in the western countries. [36, 37] . however, there is no hard evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk of covid-19 so far.a recent article in the lancet journal about hydroxychloroquine role and use has been retracted [38] .the covid-19 pandemic has devastated the global population by hitting the health individuals. it is a highly contagious disease and has caused a high rate of mortality particularly in high risk individuals. the pattern of infection and mortality rates has varied significantly amongst the countries. surprisingly, more affluent countries with greater healthcare resources have been more affected by it and have seen higher mortality rates, compared to less affluent countries like india and other southeast asian nations. we have analyzed and discussed several factors that may be responsible for such discrepancy. pneumonia from a new novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 virus was detected in wuhan, china in december 2019 and spread worldwide. the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by world health organization (who) on january 30, 2020 and announced a name for the new coronavirus disease: covid-19. since the reporting of the first case, covid-19 has so far affected 232 countries and has infected over 6 million people globally [1] . in india, covid-19 has currently more than 456251 total cases out of which 183384 are active cases and has claimed 14483 lives so far. this figure keeps changing every day. though the number of cases of covid 19 is increasing day by day due to relief in lockdown measures and migration of people, it is intriguing to note that so far the mortality has remained at a lower level in the indian subcontinent than in other countries with similar numbers of covid-19 infections (table 1 ) (figs. 1e3). even with poor infrastructure and health facilities found in india, compared to other countries with more robust health facilities such as in italy, spain, united kingdom and united states of america; the mortality data in india is a fraction to that seen in western countries. india's recovery rate from covid-19 is higher than those of many nations at the same level of infection and can be due to high suspicion of diagnosis, timely detection, and treatment. the possible reasons behind lower mortality figures in india is ambiguous, with many theories described for this. we try to elucidate various reasons for lower mortality rate in the indian subcontinent due to covid-19.we have investigated and identified the possible reasons and table 1 infection and death rates in the worst-hit ten countries by covid-19 (source: worldometer) https://www.worldometers.info/(accessed june 24, 2020) [32] . hypotheses for this disparity in mortality on several parameters as below and shall discuss them in some details.it is acknowledged that the elderly population makes up a high proportion of the covid-19 mortality across all countries [2, 3] . the western natives are significantly older than

present strain has evolved or is the same as the initial strain. it has been believed that higher mortalities seen in some of indian regions may be due to a mutant, more virulent strain of the sars-cov-2 virus [13] . many mutations observed in the sars-cov-2 sequences are therefore expected. the current estimates for the mutation rate of sars-cov-2 are about one mutation in two weeks. currently there are at least 11 different strains of sars-cov-2 (the causative agent of covid-19) in the world.researchers at cambridge university found that the virus may have mutated as it spreads from asia to europe becoming more resilient to conditions in europe and thus, deadlier however, not enough data is available on different strains [14] . the study identifies three strains of virus a, b and c; type a is prevalent in us and australia, type b wuhan's major virus type, 'b', is prevalent in patients from across east asia, c 0 variant, is the major european type, found in early patients from france, italy, sweden and england [14] .recently, scientists identified several hundreds of point mutations in sars-cov-2 across the genome. they elucidate the link between the constant change and variable virulence with an increase in mortality and morbidity. they noted 47 key point mutations located along the entire genome that might have impacted in the virulence and response to different antivirals against sars-cov-2 [15] .furthermore, eaaswarkhanth et al. have reported that s-d614 g strains may be virulent and lead to increasing its severity in the infected individuals especially in europe, where this mutation is prominent. it is also plausible that the sars-cov-2 mutations giving rise to different phylogenetic clades are responsible for the obvious death disparities around the world [16] .there are some suggestions that temperature variation and humidity may also be important factors affecting the covid-19 mortality [17, 18] . coronavirus spread is

surprisingly, more affluent countries with greater healthcare resources have been more affected by it and have seen higher mortality rates, compared to less affluent countries like india and other southeast asian nations. we have analyzed and discussed several factors that may be responsible for such discrepancy.no funding received.none.the ongoing outbreak of the corona virus disease 2019 (covid- 19) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy [1] [2] [3] . on 30 january, 2020, the world health organization (who) declared it to be a public health emergency of international concern. as of 10 march, 2020, more than 105 countries, 114,253 cases of covid-19 and 4000 deaths have been reported all over the world, of which the number of confirmed patients in china has gradually decreased, but is increasing rapidly in other countries, especially in italy, south korea, and iran, and there are lots of doctors engaged in combating it [4, 5] . the sars-cov-2 was first reported in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from three patients in wuhan jinyintan hospital and was confirmed as the cause of covid-19 on january 24, 2020 [6] . after deep examining the full-length genome, we found that the virus belongs to the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree [7] and is a new human-infecting beta-coronavirus which had previously not been detected in humans or animals. it is named covid-19 by the who and sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses as it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov) [8] ; it shares more than 87.99 % identity sequencing with the bat sars-like coronavirus, and it shares more than 80 % identity nucleotide with the original sars epidemic virus [9] [10] [11] . coronavirus spike (s) glycoproteins promote entry into cells. they are the main target of antibodies and bind with high affinity to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor in humans in a manner similar to sars-cov [12] [13] [14] . however, the sars-cov-2 s glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the s1/s2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from sars-cov and sars-related covs [15, 16] . at present, research reports that the incubation period in most people range from 1 to 14 days with a median of 5-6 days, but the incubation period may even be as long as 24 days [17] . the reproductive number (r0) for sars-cov-2, although still preliminary, is estimated between 2 and 3, suggesting a higher pandemic potential than sars [18] . fever or cough may be the major symptom, but asymptomatic individuals have also been identified as potential sources of infection [19] . at present, we think that the new coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact, but transmission from an asymptomatic carrier appears to be possible [20] . a report of 9 pregnant patients suggests that perinatal transmission is unlikely but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding [21] . although viral rna is found in stool, whether it can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route still needs to be confirmed by subsequent investigations [22, 23] . recently, some patients were found to be re-positive after being treated with negative nucleic acid tests twice and symptoms disappeared. it is difficult for us to decrease the severity of covid-19 owing to the complex structure and unclear physiological mechanism. with the increasing number of confirmed cases, the clinical investigation of patients and antiviral treatment solution has been insufficient, and there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. in order to prove more accurate conclusions on the prevalence of comorbidity and relation of clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with covid-19, we searched the relevant literatures and carried out single arm meta-analysis to describe epidemiological, clinical characteristics, complications, and outcomes of patients confirmed to have 2019-ncov infection, and to compare the severity between diabetes or hypertension and non-diabetes or non-hypertension patients. our findings provide vital guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of 2019-ncov infection.ethical approval or patient consent was not required because the present study was a review of previously published articles. full-text articles were obtained for detailed evaluation, and eligible studies were included in the systematic review. the inclusion criteria were the following: randomized controlled trial, clinical trials, and series cases; patients who were of either sex and had been diagnosed with covid-19; all patients with laboratory-identified sars-cov-2 infection who had had both real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerasechain-reaction detection of sars-cov-2 nucleic acid positive in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract, and ct scanning of the lung; inclusion of the epidemiological, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological characteristics, and treatment and outcome; clear description of the clinical characteristics such as comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy and the signs and symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea; clear description of the outcomes including the major complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), acute cardiac injury(aci), acute kidney injury(aki), shock, and incidence of severity and mortality.the exclusion criteria were the following: absence of clinical characteristics, treatment outcome, clinical experience, and case reports.two authors independently extracted data by reviewing all titles and abstracts of the searched papers. if any disagreement on the choice of the literature exists, a third evaluator will join in to make the decision. the following information was recorded from the included trials: first author, year of publication, number of participants, and residence of patients. basic data about gender, age, and diagnosis were extracted and analyzed. to evaluate the proportion of comorbidity such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy, the proportion of symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea, the proportion of clinical complications including ards, aci, aki, and shock, and the severity and mortality.two readers independently extracted and reviewed the data from the enrolled studies to ensure consistency. the quality of the included studies was assessed by the newcastle-ottawa scale. in order to objectively evaluate the publication bias of the included studies, the egger test with p < 0.05 as the existence of publication bias was performed, and those with larger values were considered as having no publication bias.the single arm meta-analysis of proportions (and 95 %ci) was calculated for the clinical symptoms, complication, outcome, and for each of the selected comorbidities using stata 15.0. the presence of heterogeneity among the identified studies (cochran's q) and the extent of heterogeneity (i 2 index) were examined, as described previously. all original data included in the literature were first transformed by double arcsine method to make them conform to normal distribution and then analyzed in stata. the initial conclusion obtained by meta-analysis was then restored using formula (p=(sin(tp/2)) 2) to reach final conclusion.we performed sensitivity analysis to assess the stability of the results and investigate the influence of each study by omitting a single study sequentially. using the egger test, we found no evidence of bias in any of the lag periods.the initial 1057 citations were identified based on a study of the subject and a summary of the literature, of which 694 articles were thereafter excluded because of duplication. after reviewing the title and abstract of the remaining 81 studies, only 34 full-text studies were evaluated for further assessment, and 13 obviously irrelevant records were excluded. eventually, 21 clinical studies [6, 17, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] were consistent with the inclusion requirements. a detailed study flow-diagram is shown in fig. 1 . the basic characteristics and quality of the included studies were illustrated in table 1 .twenty-one studies were selected, with a total of 47,344 patients (24,419 male and 22,925 females), representing approximately 40 % of the who confirmed. one clinical trial investigated the characteristics of patients in singapore and all others came from china, mainly in wuhan. systematic analysis of the studies describing the epidemiological, demographic, and clinical features of covid-19 cases and reporting of the prevalence of a number of chronic diseases in the infectious disease was undertaken. the number of cases in the selected studies varied by approximately 3722-fold and ranged from 12 to 44,672 cases. the sex ratio (male to female) was 1.06 and the overall average age of the subjects was greater than 40 years. forty-one cases reported in jinyintan hospital are the earliest confirmed cases, patients treated in wenzhou hospital almost are mild, but xiaobo yang et al. reported 52 cases with covid-19 that were all critical patients. all studies detailed the pre-treatment biochemical characteristics and subsequent treatment.eighteen studies reported the comorbidity of diabetes, only 7 of them introduced the proportion of severity, 14 studies reported hypertension and 6 of them introduced the proportion of severity, 13 studies reported malignant, and 12 studies reported cad; with regard to symptoms, 20 studies recorded fever and cough, 12 studies reported fatigue and 15 studies reported dyspnea. seven studies recorded the complication of ards and aci, and shock was recorded in 4 and 5 studies respectively. fifteen studies showed critical patients, and 12 research reported mortality. all studies provided incidence data of at least one kind of comorbidity, symptom, or complication. sixteen forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of comorbidities in covid-19 from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findings. meta-analysis of the identified studies showed that the most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever 85.6 % (95ci 81.3-89.9 %) and cough 65.7 % (95ci 60.1-71.4 %), followed by fatigue 42.4 % (95ci 32.2-52.6 %) and shortness of breath 21.4 % (95ci 15.3-27.5 %) (fig. 2) . there was significant heterogeneity (cochran's q) in the estimates of clinical symptoms among the examined studies (p < 0.001) with an i 2 index varying from 87.4 % to 95.1 %. the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension comorbidities was 7.7 % (95ci 6.1-9.3 %) and 15.6 % (95ci 12.6-18.6 %), respectively. the incidence of cardiovascular disease and malignancy was 4.7 % (95ci 3.1-6.2 %) and 1.2 % (95ci 0.5-1.8 %), respectively (fig. 3) . the case complications including ards risk ranged from 5.6 to 13.2 %, with the pooled estimate at 9.4 %. acute cardiac injury 5.8 % (95ci 0.7-10.8 %), acute kidney injury 2.1 % (95ci 0.6-3.7 %), and shock 4.7 % (95ci 0.9-8.6 %) were also present (fig. 4) . the risks of severity and mortality rate ranged from 12.6 to 23.5 % and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively. the percentage of severe cases in diabetes and hypertension cases was 44.5 % (95ci 27.0-61.9 %) and (fig. 5 ).sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the stability of pooled results. among the 21 studies, the significant results were not obviously altered after sequentially omitting each study. in the pooled results, comparing the incidence of mortality after excluding the report by chaolin huang et al., the heterogeneity decreased significantly (or = 0.719, 95 % ci = 0.277-1.865, p = 0.497, i² = 28 %) and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing the ards rate between the two groups; hence, it was regarded as a result of heterogeneity. likewise, the other studies were considered as the source of heterogeneity because the heterogeneity significantly changed and showed that there was no significant difference in preventing ards between the two groups when each of these studies were excluded from the pooled results comparing the incidence of ards. a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether the exclusion of this study would alter the result, and exclusion of this study from the meta-analysis did not substantially influence the results.in this part of the study, ards was used to assess publication bias. egger test results showed pr > jzj = 1.00. therefore, we believe that the risk of publication bias is low in this meta-analysis.the outbreak of covid-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by who. by march 10, 2020, the epidemic had spread to 25 countries around the world. in accordance with the experience of china, surgical masks are in widespread use which is beneficial to prevent the acquisition of covid-19. in addition, italy started taking measures to block traffic and lockdown villages. with the rising incidence of covid-19 all over the world, feasible and effective messaging about the clinical characteristics of covid-19 is greatly needed. therefore, the focus of this analysis was to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms, comorbidity, complications, and different outcomes in china and singapore. the meta-analysis identified 21 published studies that assessed this proportion. there are few published rcts because of the rapid development of the epidemic and there are limited medical resources in addition to the presence of uncontrollable risk during treatment. much of the evidence of effects cannot be adequately studied in randomized trials, such as long-term and rare outcomes. therefore, we analyzed all retrospective studies in this study. for the main results, we found that the cases reported to date suggest that most are older adults, and there is no difference in susceptibility between male and female. fever is the most common symptom in patients with 2019-ncov infection. the most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the rapid development of severe illness. ards and aci may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery. the severity and mortality of patients with 2019-ncov infection is lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), but the prevalence of covid-19 is much higher than sars and the mers.two coronaviruses have previously caused significant outbreaks associated with more critical disease: the sars coronavirus in 2002-2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus that emerged in 2012 [43] [44] [45] . a lot of studies have reported the clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19, but there is a lack of studies on the relation of severity and mortality with comorbidity. similarly, there is no meta-analysis published on complications for patients covid-19 infected. therefore, this is a novel systematic review and meta-analysis. due to the inadequate evidence, we present this metaanalysis by consolidating multiple studies to enable enhanced clinical decision making in the future. we report here a cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-ncov infection. patients had serious, sometimes fatal, complications and were admitted to the designated hospital. clinical presentations greatly resemble sars-cov. patients with severe illness developed ards, aki, aci, or shock and required icu admission and oxygen therapy.however, despite a comprehensive analysis, there are also many limitations that should be taken into consideration in our meta-analysis. first, the studies included in the meta-analysis were not all rcts. second, in the literature-included studies, the treatment of every hospital is not completely similar. third, owing to the treatment by grading of mild, ordinary, and critical, the severity of patients in different hospitals varies greatly. in addition, as the cause and physio pathological mechanism was unknown at the onset of emerging infections, the treatment in wuhan was only based on clinical experience, leading to a higher complication and mortality. fourth, partial missing information in a few articles may lead to biased results. we have attempted to contact investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data. moreover, clinical and methodological heterogeneities were observed in several parameters in the meta-analysis given the variation in intervention techniques, patient composition, and preferences among different cities. true heterogeneity and poor methodological quality could also lead to an asymmetric plot. in the future, larger, higher quality clinical trials should be conducted, and we will conduct a more detailed subgroup analysis to explore the sources of heterogeneity to obtain a more reliable conclusion and more effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies.covid-19 is an emerging infectious disease of global public health concern. our results note the similarity of clinical symptoms and complications between covid-19 and previous beta-coronavirus infections. the incidence of severity and mortality of covid-19 is much higher than that of ordinary influenza, and the prevalence of chronic diseases including diabetes and hypertension is rising as populations age and lifestyle and dietary habits change. in addition, we found that diabetes and hypertension are closely related to severity and mortality. improving the protection against covid-19 in persons with chronic disorders is essential. last, but not least, there is a need to limit humanto-human transmission, including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health-care workers, thus preventing transmission amplification events and preventing further international spread.the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.previous human coronaviruses, which resulted in high-morbidity (and mortality), such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov or sars-1) in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) in 2012, have driven the development of compounds that could potentially be active against the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) (caused by the novel coronavirus sars-cov-2). [1] [2] [3] [4] approximately 15% of the patients with confirmed covid-19 exhibit severe symptoms and require hospitalization, and many of them requiring hospitalization may need intensive care resources. 5 the current number of cases worldwide is over five million, with over 275,000 deaths reported as of may 2020. 6 case fatality (mortality) rates reported to date based on laboratory confirmed cases are likely to overestimate the actual covid-19 mortality rate as they did not include mild or asymptomatic cases that have recovered. ideally, the infection fatality rate should be reported as comprehensive data is available which would be important to inform planning and response.currently, no treatment nor prophylaxis has proven to be effective in covid-19, and patients receive either symptomatic treatment for milder presentations or more advanced life-support strategies in moderate to severe cases. these include oxygenation strategies in a hospitalized icu setting. severe disease results in a rapid progression of respiratory failure that begins usually right after dyspnea (breathing difficulties) and hypoxemia. a cytokine release storm with elevated blood inflammatory markers is a cardinal feature and progression to severe illness can result in severe organ failure with forms of kidney, liver, and cardiac pathology and injury and indications of coagulopathy and potential shock. as the global community eagerly awaits credible scientific solutions for this pandemic, researchers and scientists are working hard to identify effective therapeutic and preventive strategies for covid-19.recent research findings on the possible therapeutics such as antivirals, antimalarials such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, in covid-19 patients have been mostly vague, inconclusive or negative, typically underpinned by very low-quality research methodologies and inadequate reporting.7,8 the very poor methodological quality thus far across the covid-19 research landscape raises many concerns as the medical research community and governments urgently seek an effective prophylactic or therapeutic. the methodologies and reporting in these studies have been suboptimal. the randomized controlled trials (rcts) have been plagued with sub-optimal randomization, a lack of allocation concealment, no or questionable blinding, small sample sizes, small event numbers, and sparse reporting. the observational studies have been confounded, had small sample sizes, small numbers of events, sub-optimal or absent statistical adjustments, matching (propensity score approach), stratification, or any methodological technique that could mitigate the risk of biased estimates of effect. precious time and vast amount of resources are potentially being squandered as the trustworthy, robust, high-quality research that is needed for evidence-informed decision-making and policy decisions is side-lined.this urgency of clinical research has included the repurposing of existing therapies for other diseases based on indirect evidence. for example, the use of corticosteroids in covid-19 is based on the therapeutic benefit seen in randomized controlled trials (rcts) of corticosteroid use in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards)9-11. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by

in-vitro models helped remdesivir gain attention as a possible therapeutic agent.12,13 prior to the pandemic, remdesivir was an unapproved investigational product. a recent observational study examining the compassionate use of remdesivir in patients with severe covid-19 revealed that 68% of patients had clinical improvement. 14 in april, the first rct of remdesivir in patients with severe covid-19 was published; however, it was not able to identify clinical benefit and had a small sample size and failed to reach the enrolment target.in early may 2020, the us federal drug administration (fda) authorized the use of remdesivir for the treatment of individuals with severe covid-19 based on preliminary data from the actt-1 study. due to the rapid spread of covid-19 with its concerning morbidity and mortality, it is unlikely we will see further randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in light of existing data. given the urgency for an effective therapeutic, we conducted a rapid review of the existing medical research literature assessing studies using remdesivir in rcts in patients with covid-19.15, 16 we were alert to and considered all studies published since the global pandemic began in january 2020, while recognizing that the two rcts would likely comprise our final cohort of included studies.medline and embase electronic databases were searched from january 1st, 2020, to may 22nd, 2020, using a mix of keywords such as 'covid-19' and 'remdesivir along with any relevant variants. the search did use an rct filter (see appendix for medline search example). pubmed was also searched daily during this period to rapidly assess any emerging publications. evidence was considered from additional sources, including google scholar and online preprint servers, that pre-publish studies not yet having completed the peer-review process. we also searched the largest clinical medicine preprint repository, medrxiv.org.two reviewers independently and in duplicate, extracted relevant data, and assessed risk of bias using the cochrane risk of bias tool for rcts. 17 we adopted response options for risk of bias to be 'yes', 'probably yes', 'probably no', and 'no', thereby removing the 'unclear' response often reported by reviewers. the use of the 'unclear' response frequently hampers a more definitive interpretation of risk of bias. 18we used fixed-effect (inverse-variance) modeling for all analyses (mantel-haenszel risk ratio (rr) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (md) for continuous variables). 19 our intended modelling decision made a

preprint eligible and thus the decision to model whereby more weight would be given to larger sample sized studies. we would however revert to a random-effects approach should the number of uncovered rcts be high (though we did not anticipate this). when data were reported as medians and interquartile ranges, we would convert them to means and standard deviations for meta-analytical pooling. 20 we also planned to conduct sensitivity analyses based on random and fixed effect modeling.review manager 5.3 was used to conduct the meta-analysis. 21 we assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots, a cochrane chi-square statistical test for heterogeneity, and the i2 statistic (with >50% considered as significant heterogeneity warranting exploration and explaining). 22 we report 95% confidence interval (ci) measures of uncertainty with presented estimates of effect. to estimate the baseline risk in computing the absolute effects, we used the control event rate. to compute the absolute effect, we multiplied the baseline risk by the relative effect (and 95% cis).we utilized the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (grade) approach to rate the certainty of the evidence for each outcome and the entire body of evidence. 23 this outcome centric approach for rating effect estimate certainty considers the body of evidence via risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency (heterogeneity), indirectness, and publication bias domains when assessing rcts.all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer

developed no funnel plots or statistical tests for publication bias due to the limited interpretability when the study number is less than the optimal threshold of 10.24the two studies reported on mortality, but the wang study15 reported 28-day mortality, and the biegel study16 only reported on 14-day mortality. due to the biegel study reporting preliminary results, with many subjects still within the follow-up phase of the trial, the mortality estimates were reported on the kaplan-meier estimator.based on our reading of the reported mortality findings by biegel16 and the pooling of the 14-day mortality from the biegel16 study with kaplan-meier estimates to the wang15 mortality data (n=1,141 patients), there was a significant reduction of mortality in patients who received remdesivir compared to the control group (rr 0·69, 95% ci 0·49 to 0·99), p<0.05; i2 = 52%; fixed-effect modeling, low certainty) (figure 1 ). absolute effects were 35 fewer deaths per 1,000 affected individuals (54 fewer to 1 fewer) (grade evidence profile table 2 ). sensitivity analysis using random-effects modeling and the use of intention to treat (itt) population for biegel16, or the use of the sample size reported as available for analysis, reveals no difference in direction or magnitude of risk estimates. in fact, when the raw mortality data is utilized in fixed-effect modelling with the reported full sample size, we found a more significant reduction in mortality due to remdesivir (rr 0.67, 95% ci 0.47 to 0.96). however, as indicated, we modelled based on the kaplan-meier estimator. two studies (n=1,299) reported on time to clinical improvement and revealed significant improvement of time to clinical improvement in patients who received remdesivir compared to the control group (mean difference (md) -3·95 days, 95% ci -4.05 days to -3.86 days), p=0.11; i2 = 97%; fixed-effect modeling, moderate certainty) (figure 1 ). absolute effects were 3·95 fewer days (4.05 fewer days to 3.86

presented in this systematic review focused on remdesivir use in hospitalized covid-19 patients. our pooled analysis reveals that remdesivir significantly reduces mortality, time to clinical improvement, the number of people with serious adverse events, and the number of people with any adverse events.the grade quality of evidence (also known as certainty or confidence in estimates of effect) reflects the extent of our certainty or confidence that the estimates of an effect are adequate to support a particular decision or recommendation. 23 we found some issues applying grade with indirectness, imprecision, and inconsistency across the body of evidence for the analyzed patientimportant outcomes. we have low certainty or confidence in the range of mortality effects despite reportedly significant benefits of a decrease in mortality, with 37 fewer deaths per 1,000, with a range from 61 fewer to 1 fewer death; the range of mortality absolute risk effect ranges from a 51% reduction to a 1% reduction of risk. the low certainty in the risk of mortality estimates are due to the serious concerns with imprecision due to a small number of events, and indirectness due to the pooling of 14 day and 28-day mortality results. we made the judgement to pool mortality data based on the hazard ratio kaplan-meier data and not simply the raw data reported in table 2 (32 in remdesivir vs 54 in placebo with samples sizes of 538 and 521 respectively; incidentally, mortality reductions would have been even more favourable). we employed a fix-effect model given the small number of studies and a decision to focus more weight on the study with the larger sample size (contributes more information).we are moderately confident remdesivir in patients hospitalized with covid-19 leads to faster clinical improvement, with an important and significant decrease in time to clinical improvement using remdesivir of 3.95 fewer days, ranging from 4.05 fewer to 3.86 fewer days. we are highly confident in an important and significant decrease in severe adverse events with the use of remdesivir in the individuals hospitalized with covid-19, with 62 fewer severe events per 1,000 ranging from 99 fewer to 16 fewer serious adverse events.using random effect modelling did not change the pooled point estimates or confidence intervals appreciably in the context of harms and benefits of the intervention for all reported outcomes, except for all adverse events. for all adverse events, the use of random-effects modeling led to a confidence interval that spanned harms and benefits; with fixed-effect modeling, the confidence interval was wholly in the benefits portion, leading us to be moderately certain in a modest reduction in adverse events. given the reduction in imprecision for all adverse events outcome, the grade assessment was moderate with fixed effect modeling and low with random-effects modeling.our study has several strengths. firstly, we assessed the eligibility of all studies and the risk of bias independently and in duplicate. we intended the summary pooling of the data had we judged that the data was reliable enough to allow a meaningful pooled estimate of effect. additionally, we intended the use of the grade approach to assess the certainty or quality of the evidence. our analysis of the available literature had significant limitations, including the paucity of studies available for analysis. the research evidence on the benefits of remdesivir in covid-19 is however, in our judgement, based on two rigorous multicenter trials.additionally, there was significant heterogeneity in the time to clinical improvement, which could be due to the location of the studies and the differences in standard of care between the studies that were conducted at different periods in the context of the evolving evidence landscape during the pandemic. timing of initiation of remdesivir may also impact clinical outcomes, with patients with more severe disease being less likely to survive as seen in the actt-1 subgroups, however we were unable to pool data according to these subgroups.due to the public health emergency of the covid-19 pandemic, there likely will not be any additional randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine remdesivir's efficacy in patients with covid-19, and instead, it would be incorporated into standard of care. in addition, remdesivir appears to reduce the time to clinical improvement and the number of serious adverse events and can ameliorate the conditions at many overwhelmed hospitals facing the pandemic patient surges.all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv

life-threatening respiratory failure, indeed persists. we are still left with questions, and clinicians must interpret this pooled evidence with caution, though very promising. further research on the use of other therapeutic agents in covid-19 patients is urgently needed and it is more likely that remdesivir would be of most utility when used in combination with other potential therapeutics (based on hopefully positive findings from ongoing studies). such robust studies should be adequately powered rcts, with longer durations of follow-up, that are methodologically superior, and focuses on harm outcomes.the primary concern present in the context of the current crisis with continued lack of a viable treatment option in patients suffering from sars-cov-2 life-threatening respiratory failure,

and with focuses on harm outcomes.in closing, we remind that safety of the patient suffering from covid19 is a key priority to improve the quality of care in the provision of health services. currently, no therapeutic option has been shown to be effective (though remdesivir is presently revealing promise as one option likely in conjunction with another treatment (s)) and that conclusively allows for safe and effective use to mitigate or eliminate the causative agent of covid-19; the very same can be said about prophylaxis whereby approximately 200 therapeutic options or their combinations are being investigated in more than 1,700 clinical trials. severely ill patients with covid-19, frequently older adults and with established comorbidities, are being given multiple concomitant medications and without considering possible adverse events and interactions. this is an area of research that is being overlooked and the potential toxicity due to concomitant treatments must be urgently addressed. we again remind that the use of medications such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (alone or in combination with azithromycin), ivermectin, antivirals, and immunomodulators, among others, should be considered within the context of patient consented, randomized clinical trials that evaluate their safety and efficacy. ensuring the safety of patients with covid-19 requires information and surveillance systems that include standardized procedures in order to report adverse events and interactions according to local settings and public health reporting regulations. if these do not exist, they must be implemented immediately.all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has

countries, areas or territories. 60 approximately 3.5 million cases and 250,000 deaths were recorded worldwide as of may 2020 1 .increasing experience with this disease has led to the understanding that it is not just an illness of 62 the respiratory system, but that there are significant cardiovascular effects. recent works by biomarkers such as troponin), but that those who developed cardiac injury had a significantly 66 higher mortality than those without. moreover, a multivariable analysis of 416 patients found 67 that cardiac injury was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients 68 with covid-19 4 . therefore, the purpose of this study was to present a systematic review and 69 meta-analysis of literature to investigate the incidence of cardiac injury, its correlations with co-70 morbidities and outcomes, and its possible mechanisms in the global covid-19 population. 74 we performed a systematic literature search in pubmed and embase. we used the following 75 search terms: ("coronavirus") and ("cardiac injury" or "myocardial injury" or "myocarditis" 76 or "troponin"). the search was limited to chinese and english and all articles from jan 1, 2020 77 to may 30, 2020 were reviewed. original studies that reported cardiac injury as elevated troponin levels were included. review 81 articles, meta-analysis and case reports were excluded. an aggregate data meta-analysis was 82 performed. the extracted data included the number of patients enrolled in each study, age, the primary outcome was defined as all-cause mortality. if mortality in patients with or without 90 cardiac injury was not directly reported, the mortality rate of patients with cardiac injury was 91 calculated as the ratio of deceased patients with cardiac injury to the overall number of patients 92 with reported cardiac injury. the secondary outcome was defined as any one of death, icu 93 admission, respiratory failure in need of mechanical ventilation or shock 5 . odds ratio. p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. statistical 102 heterogeneity was evaluated using the i 2 statistic. publication bias was evaluated using funnel 103 plots. sensitivity analyses were performed to identify potential heterogeneity by leaving out each 104 study. table 1 .cardiac injury was defined as elevated serum troponin levels. due to differences in the types of 115 troponin tested at each center and sensitivity of testing, specific troponin cut-off criteria for each 116 included study was also outlined in table 1 . table s1 compiles the incidence of cardiac injury in hospitalized covid-19 patients. the primary outcome of all-cause mortality in hospitalized covid-19 patients with cardiac 125 injury was 72.6% (307/423 patients) compared to a mortality rate of 14.5% (171/1181 patients) 126 in patients without cardiac injury (or=17.32, 95% ci 9.21-32.57, i 2 =66%, z=8.85, p<0.00001) 127 as shown in figure 2a . 169 since the outbreak, cardiac injury in covid-19 patients who needed inpatient care has been 170 described. cardiac injury in the form of myopericarditis were reported from china and europe 7, 8 .these case reports should ring a bell on the potential involvement of the cardiovascular system 172 in a wider range of covid-19 patients worldwide. more than a dozen studies have reported 173 incidence of cardiac injury in hospitalized covid-19 patients, ranging from 7% to 44% 2-4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . 174 however, no consensus was reached on the overall incidence of cardiac injury in these patients. 175 li et al 22 performed a meta-analysis and attempted to determine the incidence of cardiac injury. 176 however, only two studies (179 patients) were analyzed and the overall incidence of cardiac 177 injury was 8% (15/179). although two other studies with more patients were included, only 178 elevated creatine kinase levels were reported, which was not specific for cardiac injury and could 179 not represent true incidence. in this analysis, 14 studies were integrated to look into how cardiac injury affected outcomes in 239 hospitalized covid-19 patients. it was discovered that hospitalized covid-19 patients with 240 cardiac injury had a significantly increased mortality rate compared to those without, with an or 241 of 17.32. the mortality rate of hospitalized covid-19 patients with cardiac injury was found to 242 be 72.6% . this mortality rate was significantly higher than any mortality rates reported so far. to note that these high rates of mortality were only associated with covid-19 patients who were 258 hospitalized and could not be applied to those who did not require hospitalization. range. in order to analyze some of these continuous variables, conversion to median with 303 standard deviation was necessary, which might introduce bias in our results. our meta-analysis revealed that cardiac injury was common in hospitalized covid-19 patients 307 and its incidence was similar between the chinese and the western population. the overall 308 mortality of patients with cardiac injury was alarmingly high. cardiac injury was significantly 309 associated with older age and co-morbidities including htn and copd. early screening, triage 310 and support is warranted to help reduce the incidence of cardiac injury in hospitalized covid-311 19 and its associated mortality. coronavirus disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is a global pandemic that initially started in wuhan, china, and spread extremely quickly, making its way to over 180 countries. as the novel coronavirus continues to evolve, there are still many limitations to our knowledge of who exactly this virus would impact critically. older adults and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, have shown worse prognosis [1] . diabetic patients have increased morbidity and mortality rates and have been linked to more hospitalization and intensive care unit (icu) admissions [1] . people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) or any respiratory illnesses are also at higher risk for severe illness from covid-19 [2] . the risk of contracting covid-19 in patients with copd is found to be 4-fold higher than patients without copd [2] . this article is part of the topical collection on covid-19 * adekunle sanyaolu sanyakunle@hotmail.com 1 federal ministry of health, abuja, nigeria a retrospective study of middle-aged and elderly patients with covid-19 found that the elderly population is more susceptible to this illness and is more likely to be admitted to the icu with a higher mortality rate [3] . the age-related changes in the geriatric population may be due to the changes in lung anatomy and muscle atrophy which results in changes in physiologic function, reduction of lung reserve, reduction of airway clearance, and reduction of the defense barrier function [3] .the clinical outcomes and length of stay directly correlate with the underlying conditions and age of the covid-19 patient. researchers in china studied 344 patients in the icu with covid-19. of the 344 subjects, 133 patients died on the 28th day with a median survival of 25 days [4] . of these patients, there were many with different comorbidities with 141 patients having hypertension [4] . in survivors, the median duration of hospitalization for a negative test result was 12 days [4] . furthermore, another study conducted in china studied 633 covid-19 patients, of whom 247 patients had at least one comorbidity and that concluded that older individuals, greater than 60 years, were more likely to exhibit a more severe form of covid-19 disease [5] . during the study, 25 patients with a median age of 69.3 years died giving an effective mortality rate of 3.77% [5] .it has been concluded that the older the patients are, the more likely they are to succumb to the covid-19 disease. in the usa, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) uses covid-net in 14 states to monitor the demographics of covid-19 patients who are being hospitalized [6] . from march 1 through 30, 2020, there were a total of 180 patients on covid-net, of which 89.3% of the patients had an underlying comorbidity [6] . of the 180 patients, 94.4% aged 65 years and older had at least comorbidity [6] . the most common comorbidities found were obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus [6] . the purpose of this paper is to review these comorbidities, given that most patients with severe covid-19 cases had comorbidity. furthermore, we would like to examine specific comorbidities in relation to the covid-19 disease progression and outcomes based on the literature report since the outbreak.an electronic literature search was performed using pubmed, google scholar, ebscohost, mendeley, and medline plus. the search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published from january to april 20, 2020. an article was selected if it included keywords such as coronavirus, covid-19, sars-cov-2, clinical features, comorbidity, diabetes, and hypertension. articles were then reviewed and included based on the applicability to the topic.confirmed and reported cases of covid-19 have a wide range of symptoms from mild complaints, such as fever and cough, to more critical cases associated with difficulty in breathing [7] . some of the most common symptoms include cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath (sob), muscle aches, sore throat, unexplained loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, and headache [8] . symptoms can start as mild and become more intense over 5 to 7 days, worsening if pneumonia develops in patients [8] . approximately, 1 out of 6 infected individuals become seriously ill and develop difficulty in breathing, especially in the elderly with underlying health conditions [9] .a meta-analysis study of covid-19 patients, as depicted in fig. 1 , showed fever (88.8%) as the most common symptom, followed by dry cough (68%) and fatigue (33%) [10] . other symptoms noted were productive cough (28.5%), sob (17%), muscle pain (14.4%), sore throat (11.4%), and headache (10.2%) [10] . the least common symptoms were diarrhea (4.4%), nausea and vomiting (4.1%), rhinorrhea (3.2%), abdominal pain (0.16%), and chest pain (0.11%) [10] .symptoms of covid-19 may appear anytime from 2 to 14 days after exposure; therefore, 14-day quarantine is recommended [7] . the average incubation period for covid-19 is approximately 5.2 days [11] . in wuhan, china, the most common symptoms observed from the onset of this outbreak include fever, cough, and fatigue, while some features that were not so prevalent were sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and gastrointestinal (gi) symptom such as diarrhea [12, 13] . another study that was conducted in beijing, china, showed that the average age of patients with covid-19 was 35.5 years and had a mean of 3.5 days from the onset of symptoms to admission in the hospital [14] . the same study also showed that fever was present in 87.5% of patients, which persisted for 6.5 days, and symptoms resolved 2.5 days after a negative test result [14] .some individuals who are infected do not develop any symptoms at all, and about 80% of positive cases recover from the disease without any treatment [9] . however, there have also been instances of transmissions of covid-19 from one person to another before the person became aware of being sick, or the symptoms were so mild that the person did not know he/she had the illness [15] . it becomes essential to seek medical attention immediately if a person suspects that he/she may have been infected or is a confirmed case of covid-19 experiencing respiratory distress, has blue lips, is in constant pain, or has pressure in the chest [7] . also, it is important to note that covid-19 is more infectious than sars-cov and mers-cov due to its numerous epidemiological and biological characteristics [16] .due to covid-19 being a relatively new and understudied disease, the data available is limited. however, from the cases that emerged, it was observed that comorbidities increase the chances of infection [7] . based on current information and clinical expertise, the elderly, especially those in long-term care facilities, and people of any age with serious underlying medical conditions are at a greater risk of getting covid-19 [7] . the elderly, a vulnerable population, with chronic health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular or lung disease are not only at a higher risk of developing severe illness but are also at an increased risk of death if they become ill [15] . people with underlying uncontrolled medical conditions such as diabetes; hypertension; lung, liver, and kidney disease; cancer patients on chemotherapy; smokers; transplant recipients; and patients taking steroids chronically are at increased risk of covid-19 infection [7] .a meta-analysis study on covid-19 comorbidities, as depicted in fig. 2 , had a total of 1786 patients, of which 1044 were male and 742 were female with a mean age of 41 years old [10] . the most common comorbidities identified in these patients were hypertension (15.8%), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions (11.7%), and diabetes (9.4%) [10, 17] . the less common comorbidities were coexisting infection with hiv and hepatitis b (1.5%), malignancy (1.5%), respiratory illnesses (1.4%), renal disorders (0.8%), and immunodeficiencies (0.01%) [10] .patients with moderate to severe asthma are at a disadvantage because this virus affects their respiratory tracts, leading to increased asthmatic attacks, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress [7] . according to the cdc's morbidity and mortality weekly report, 34.6% of patients aged 18 to 49 years old have an underlying chronic lung disease, such as asthma [6] . in iran, a case study reported that genetic predisposition to covid-19 can increase the probabilities of getting infected with sars-cov-2 and can lead to death from this virus [18] . this genetic predisposition was seen in 3 brothers in iran who were 6 years apart in age (54, 60, and 66) years who died due to covid-19, despite no identified comorbidities and living separately from one another [18] . as of january 2, 2020, wuhan, china, had 41 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for covid-19, of which 73% (30/41) were men with a median age of 49 years old, 66% (27/41) of these patients had been exposed to the huanan market, 32% (13/41) had underlying diseases such as diabetes 20% (8/41), hypertension 15% (6/41), and cardiovascular 15% (6/41) [12] . patients who are hiv positive, along with a low cd4 count and not on antiretroviral therapy, have a higher risk and incidence of other medical issues including covid-19 [7] . according to the international aids society (ias), people [10] who are human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) positive, taking antiretroviral treatment, and do not have a low cd4 count will have the same risk of having covid-19 as one without hiv [19, 20] . as depicted in fig. 3 , a population-based surveillance report via covid-19-associated hospitalization surveillance network (covid-net) reported clinical data on 1478 covid-19-positive patient hospitalizations from march 1 to march 30, 2020 [6] . among the 1478 patients studied, 12% of adults showed clinical data of underlying medical conditions with the most prevalent being hypertension (49.7%) and obesity a close second (48.3%) [6] . other medical conditions included chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus (28.3%), and cardiovascular diseases (27.8%) [6] .outcome covid-19 can cause severe disease leading to hospitalization in icu and potentially death, especially in the elderly with comorbidities [21] . according to the cdc, 8 out of 10 deaths reported in the usa occurred in adults 65 years old and above [7] . roughly 80% of covid-19-positive cases result in full recovery from the illness without any hospitalizations or interventions [9] . there are still many facts that we do not know about covid-19 due to gaps in knowledge; therefore, many studies are underway to better understand this virus [15] .wuhan, china, had 41 patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for covid-19 from december 16, 2019, to january 2, 2020, and the clinical outcomes are shown 15 [6] in fig. 4 [12] . of the 41 patients with confirmed covid-19 in the hospital, 100% had pneumonia, 29% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), 15% exhibited an acute cardiac injury, and 12% acquired a secondary infection [12] . the majority of these patients (68%) were discharged, 17% remained hospitalized, 10% ended up in the icu, and 15% ended in death [12] .from february 20 to march 5, 2020, a study was conducted in evergreen, washington, on the characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 diagnosis [22] . this study showed that 71% of these patients required mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory arrest was seen in all of them [22] . within 72 h of developing ards, 53% of these patients showed increasing severity of respiratory problems, leading to poor short-term outcomes and a higher risk of death [22] . as of march 17, 2020, the mortality rate was 67% in these patients, with 24% critically ill and 9.5% discharged from hospital [22] .as shown in the cdc's mortality and morbidity weekly report in fig. 5 , case mortality increased as the patient's age increased [21, 23] . among the age group ≤ 19 years, no icu admission or mortality was reported [21] . covid-19 has also been noticed in children, but the disease took a more moderate course when compared with adults. the prognosis was also seemingly better, and deaths were infrequent [24] .on april 29, 2020, who reported over 3 million confirmed covid-19 cases worldwide, with over 200,000 of these cases resulting in mortality [25] . the majority of these [12] deaths are within the usa with over 50,000, followed by italy with over 25,000 and spain with over 20,000 [25] . new york is being hit the hardest by the novel coronavirus spreading across the usa, with more cases and deaths per capita than any other state. table 1 reports that over 86% of covid-19 deaths involved at least one comorbidity, according to the new york state department of health [26] .multiple comorbidities are associated with the severity of covid-19 disease progression. many of the poorer outcomes for covid-19 have been related to cardiovascular comorbid conditions [27] . however, this may be a direct result of the cardiovascular condition itself or attributed to other comorbidities along with a cardiovascular condition [27] . patients with type 2 diabetes were also more likely to have increased severity of covid-19 [28] . in a cohort study of 7337 patients with covid-19 with and without type 2 diabetes, it was shown that those with type 2 diabetes required increased interventions for their hospital stay versus those that were nondiabetic [28] . it was shown that those with poorer blood glucose control had an all-around increased mortality rate than those with better glucose control [28] . the study concluded that patients with blood glucose specifically those in the range of 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/l had overall decreased composite adverse events and mortality [28] . it was noted that poor blood glucose control resulted in a substantially increased risk of complications and death [28] . among other comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) has also been associated with poor disease progression. a meta-analysis of multiple studies in china found that there was a four-fold increase in mortality in patients with preexisting copd that were diagnosed with covid-19 [29] . in this analysis, the smoking status of patients and severity of covid-19 were also studied. only one study was found to have an association with smoking and severe course of covid-19 [29] . after this study was removed, there was no significant association with smoking and severe covid-19 disease [29] . patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure associated with the novel coronavirus may be linked to a prothrombotic coagulopathy [30] . the autopsy of covid-19-related deaths revealed dispersed microthrombi in the pulmonary vasculature, demonstrating an occlusive etiology of respiratory failure [30] . a 38 to 100% improvement was noted in three cases with covid-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and respiratory failure, following treatment with intravenous (iv) antithrombotic alteplase [30] . the results, although reassuring, were transient in two of the three cases with recovery succumbing posttreatment [30] . the use of anti-thrombolytic therapy needs to be further studied to ascertain that the results are due to treatment and not chance alone [30] . a retrospective meta-analysis including 1558 covid-19 patients was conducted until march 1, 2020, on subjects with underlying comorbidities and the risk for acquiring covid-19 [31] . common comorbidities such as hypertension, copd, diabetes, and cardiocerebrovascular disease were observed to be the more significant risk factors in subjects when compared with other underlying disease states [31] . other than intense supportive measures, a definitive treatment has yet to be identified [31] . authorities speculate that subjects with comorbidities were linked to a more severe disease outcome when infected with the novel coronavirus when compared with patients with no underlying disease [31] . the study was met with barriers due to the diminutive sample size and some subjects having more than one underlying comorbidity [31] . in literature and earlier research, underlying diseases increase the mortality rate in patients who acquired covid-19 with cardiac disease and diabetes being the most significant risk factors [32] . once again, insufficient sample size and inadequate time have led to limitations in the data collected [32] .over 180 countries have been affected by covid-19, resulting in mass death worldwide. as cases evolve globally, it has been noted that persons with underlying chronic illnesses are more likely to contract the virus and become severely ill.due to sars cov-2 being a relatively new virus, the data available is limited. however, patients with comorbidities have more deteriorating outcomes compared with patients without. covid-19 patients with history of hypertension, obesity, chronic lung disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular [26] disease have the worst prognosis and most often end up with deteriorating outcomes such as ards and pneumonia. also, elderly patients in long-term care facilities, chronic kidney disease patients, and cancer patients are not only at risk for contracting the virus, but there is a significantly increased risk of death among these groups of patients. of the cases reported worldwide, symptoms of covid-19 ranged from mild respiratory disease to severe illness, which requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. since there is a period where the patient is asymptomatic, and the incubation period is between 2 and 14 days, it is difficult to establish an early diagnosis, much less curb the transmission of the infection if the patient is unknowingly exposed. however, within this period, if respiratory symptoms develop, it is important to seek immediate care.therefore, patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with sars cov-2, as they usually have the worst prognosis. these precautions include regular handwashing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, limiting person-to-person contact and practicing social distancing, wearing a face mask in public places, and overall limiting going to public areas at this time unless it is necessary. hence, there is a need for a global public health campaign to raise awareness, on reducing the burden of these comorbidity illnesses causing deaths in covid-19-infected patients.municipal population and family planning commission foundation, grant/award number: wx16c03 confidence interval = 4.627-425.088). these results suggest that the nlr at hospital admission is associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with covid-19.therefore, the nlr appears to be a significant prognostic biomarker of outcomes in critically ill patients with covid-19. however, further investigation is needed to validate this relationship with data collected prospectively. wuhan and was confirmed as the cause of the ncip. 5 studies have shown that the disease caused by sars-cov-2, recently named as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) by world health organization (who), could induce symptoms including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and lymphopenia in infected patients. in more severe cases, infections causing viral pneumonia may lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and even death. 2, 3, 6 most of the initial cases of covid-19, the disease caused by sars-cov-2, were all related to huanan seafood wholesale market, which sells aquatic products, live poultries, and wild animals. 2 the first batch of cases identified later showed no exposure or even no relation to huanan wholesale market, and the human-to-human transmission was confirmed; moreover, nosocomial infections were reported in some health care workers. 3, 7 the number of fatalities due to covid-19 is escalating. however, at this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for covid-19. most therapy consists of empirical antibiotics, antiviral therapy (oseltamivir), and systemic corticosteroids, which may have a limited effect on a fatal outcome. evidence is now accumulating that the condition of some patients with covid-19 deteriorates rapidly. as of 20 may 2020, who's online covid-19 situation dashboard reveals there have been 4 801 202 confirmed cases of covid-19, including 318 935 deaths. thus, identifying the prognostic predictors of mortality in patients with covid-19 might be useful for assessing the disease severity and making optimal treatment decisions.the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (nlr) has been suggested as a simple marker of the systemic inflammatory response in critical care patients. 8, 9 it has also been reported as an independent prognostic factor for noninfectious diseases, such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and several types of cancers. [10] [11] [12] in addition, nlr has been shown to be an independent indicator of both short-term and long-term mortality in critically ill patients. 13 therefore, the nlr is a systemic inflammatory marker and a potential predictor of clinical risk and outcome in many diseases. to our knowledge, the utility of nlr to predict mortality in patients with covid-19 has not been studied yet. based on the previous studies, we hypothesized that nlr might relate to the disease severity and mortality in patients with covid-19. in the current study, we sought to investigate whether nlr is a prognostic factor in patients with covid-19.all adult (age >18 years old) patients who were diagnosed with covid-19 according to who interim guidance were screened, and those who died or were discharged between 11 january 2020 and 3 march 2020 were included in our study. data were collected from patients who were cured and discharged, or who died without a cure. were amplified and tested. the primers used were as follows: target 1 (orf1ab): forward primer, ccctgtgggttttaca-cttaa; reverse pri-and myocardial enzymes. chest radiographs or computed tomography scan were also done for all inpatients. 15 all patients age more than 18 years, and having neutrophil and lymphocyte counts results within 24 hours after admission, were included in this study. patients who missed the neutrophil and lymphocyte records or with chronic hematological disorder were excluded.the electronic medical records of the patients were reviewed by a trained research team of physicians in wuhan third hospital & tongren hospital of wuhan university. epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. patient data included demographics, medical history, exposure history, comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, and treatment (antiviral, antibiotic, and corticosteroid therapies, and respiratory support). all data were checked by two physicians (hc and js) and a third researcher (sn) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers.baseline characteristics were presented as median with interquartile range (iqr) for continuous variables and as number with percentage for categorical variables. comparisons between continuous variables were analyzed by the student t and mann-whitney u test based on variable distribution, and categorical variables were analyzed by the χ 2 test. the data were tested to the kolmogorov-smirnov normality test for homogeneity of variance. to assess the relationship between the nlr and inhospital mortality, we did the receiver operating characteristics (roc) curve and reported area under the roc curve. next, we grouped the patients based on the cut-off value of nlr during hospitalization. in addition, to adjust potential confounding with variables, we did a multivariate regression analysis. the following variables were considered for multivariable adjustment: age, gender, smoking status, laboratory data, comorbidities, and intensive care unit (icu) length of stay. the results were reported as hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% ci). all statistical processes were performed with the statistical package for the social sciences 20.0 (spss inc, chicago, il). a two-sided p value less than .05 was considered statistically significant. nonparametric roc analysis showed that the cut-off value of the roc curve as the optimal threshold for in-hospital mortality was 11 .75, that is, when nlr was more than 11.75, the model had the strongest predictive ability, with an area under the curve of 0.945% and 95% ci of 0.917 to 0.973 (figure 1 ), sensitivity of 97.5%, specificity of 78.1%, and yoden index of 0.756. we further divided patients into two groups using nlr greater than or less than or equal to 11.75 as the criterion to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with a high nlr and those with a low nlr (table 2 ).after multivariate logistic regression analysis, high-nlr remained independently associated with in-hospital death. in addition, we found that higher levels of hs-crp, nt-probnp, and blood urea nitrogen, as well as history of hypertension, respiratory failure, digestive system diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases, were also independently associated with in-hospital mortality (table 3 ).in this study, we found there was an association between nlr and the clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19. 16 based on the roc curve analysis, the nlr showed the significant performance to predict in-hospital mortality.the cut-off level for the nlr was 11.75 ( figure 1 ). our study supports that a high nlr is a strong predictor for in-hospital mortality in pa- the worldwide outbreak of a new type of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [sars] coronavirus 2) causing coronavirus disease (covid-19) has rapidly changed societies in the first 3 months of 2020. covid-19 was first reported in december 2019 in wuhan, the capital of hubei province, china [1]. as a response to a broader disease threat, china placed restrictions on travel in and out of wuhan on january 23, 2020, but the virus was detected in europe already in january in countries such as france (january 24, 2020) and finland (january 26, 2020) [2]. currently, it is not known how long there were active covid-19 cases circling in europe before different countries started to react to the epidemic. the first death caused by covid-19 outside asia occurred in france on february 15, 2020. in italy, the number of infections started to rise rapidly in the last week of february [3]. during march 2020, almost all european countries placed at least some restrictions in an effort to prevent a further uncontrolled spread of the virus.much of the focus of covid-19 discussion and research has centralized on epidemiological factors. the reproductive number (r0) of covid-19 has been considered higher than that of sars. in a recent review study, the average r0 of covid-19 was found to be 3.28 with a median of 2.79 [4]. viral shedding of the novel coronavirus is also long (median 20 days in survivors), and nonsurvivors have died, on average, after 18-19 days of illness onset [5,6]. case fatality and infection fatality ratios have been recently reported for china, being 3.67% and 0.66%, respectively [6]. in europe, similar estimations have not been made yet, but covid-19 mortality has been particularly high in some regions such as lombardy, italy. data shows major country variations in the spread and mortality rates of covid-19 within europe, but reasons behind the spread of the disease and subsequent mortality remain partly unexplained. different countries have also responded to the epidemic at different rates, which gives a starting point for our investigations on societal and psychological factors related to the spread of covid-19. a social scientific perspective could help us understand covid-19 mortality.social factors are important in epidemics, which should always be understood in their ecological context [7]. this means, for example, that social activity has an impact on the spread of viruses. european countries vary greatly in terms of population density, and there are also differences in the number of social contacts people have and interact with on a daily basis. in addition, there are major cultural differences in the physical distance people keep when interacting with their close friends and other people [8]. for instance, southern european countries have been traditionally considered as contact cultures in comparison to noncontact cultures, such as north europe and asia [8-10]. during an epidemic, both the physical and social closeness of people are factors that explain the spread of the disease.another important social factor explaining the spread of viruses is trust. trust in institutions and other people is considered an important factor in the well-being and overall functioning of societies [11,12]. institutional trust can be a crucial part of epidemic management and prevention because trust in public systems and authorities such as health care systems influences how people use services and follow instructions [13]. trust in institutions becomes important after disruptive events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or epidemics [14,15]. research evidence from previous epidemics showed that those who had lower trust in the government were less likely to take precautions against the ebola virus disease in liberia and congo during the 2014-2016 outbreak [16,17]. similar findings were also noted during the 2002-2004 sars outbreak in hong kong [18]. great trust in authorities has also been associated with carrying out avoidant behaviors during the swine flu epidemic in the united kingdom [19].dozens of studies have previously demonstrated significant country differences in institutional trust, making it an essential societal element to consider [20,21]. trust in state institutions is typically highest in nordic countries (finland, denmark, iceland, norway, sweden), which also rank high in different welfare statistics worldwide [22]. elsewhere in europe, institutional trust is found to be low, particularly in eastern european countries but also in southern european countries such as italy [23,24]. determinants of institutional trust vary across different sides of europe, but the perceived lack of responsiveness of political and governmental entities often results in low received trust from the public. in east central europe, older individuals and women have been found to show more trust toward institutions, while trust in political institutions is lower among more educated people [25]. in southern european countries such as italy and spain, socialization experiences are largely associated with low institutional trust, and attitudes toward political institutions are deeply rooted in cultural legacy [26]. in other words, institutional trust is lowest in those countries characterized as contact cultures. the combination of social closeness and lack of trust in authorities might turn out to be lethal within europe, at least for older adults.the aim of our study was to examine country variations of covid-19 mortality in europe by analyzing social risk factors that may explain the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust. we expected to find societal differences especially in the capability of coping with this crisis situation.this study was based on an analysis of european social survey (ess) data on 25 european countries (n=47,802). data were from 2016 (ess8) except for bulgaria, cyprus, and slovakia, whose data were from 2012 (ess6), and denmark with data from 2014 (ess4). ess data sets are openly available for research purposes at the ess web site [27]. additional country information was received from eurostat and the world bank. covid-19 mortality and incidence figures were drawn from the database built by the coronavirus resource centre at johns hopkins university [28]. the data were updated april 15, 2020, for this article. country restrictions were drawn from the official websites of states and ministries, and other related webpages created for the purpose of providing covid-19 updates.ess data are publicly available and downloadable at the ess website. the collection of their self-reported data is based on informed consent and subscribes to the declaration of professional ethics of the international statistical institute. all ess surveys have gone through ethical review by the ess european research infrastructure consortium research ethics board [29]. our analyses focused on creating country-level information, and no observations at the individual level were used. other used data were also publicly available. all data and code are available via open science framework [30].covid-19 mortality and incidence time series data were collected for 25 european countries and covered 84 days of the covid-19 epidemic (january 22 to april 14, 2020). incidence rates were also collected, but they are treated only as controls, because countries differ a lot in their testing rates. hence, mortality figures provide more accurate information on the spread of the epidemic from february to april 2020.information on country restrictions included national bans or restrictions. these included bans on public events, curfews, country border closures, restrictions on restaurant operations, and elementary school contact teaching. public events, curfews, or unauthorized outings were reviewed and applied from the date when the first nationwide restriction became effective. country border closures were determined starting from the date when all the borders of the country were closed. restrictions on restaurant operations and elementary school contact teaching were calculated from the date when at least some national restrictions became effective. restrictions varied in exact content and accuracy across countries.general country information includes the size of the population, population density (persons per square kilometer), old-age dependency ratio (ie, ratio of people aged 65 years or older), gender ratio, life expectancy at birth, health care expenditure (euros per inhabitant), and number of tourist arrivals per year. self-reported country information included perceived sociability, household size, the proportion of older people living with children, and perceived institutional trust.the perceived sociability was measured with a question: “how often do you take part in social activities compared to others of same age.” the given responses were 1, “much less than most,” 2 “less than most,” 3 “about the same,” 4 “more than most,” and 5 “much more than most.” household size was based on respondents’ information on how many people live regularly in their household. the proportion of older adults living with children was calculated by grouping respondents aged 65 years or older according to whether they currently live in the same household with children. institutional trust was measured by respondents’ trust in five institutions, namely, parliament, politicians, political parties, the police, and the legal system. respondents were asked how much they personally trust these institutions on a scale from 0 to 10, in which 0 meant no trust at all, and 10 meant complete trust. reliability of the measure was good with cronbach alpha ranging from 0.82 to 0.92. in the analyses, institutional trust was categorized as very low (19 or less), low (20-22), high (23-29), and very high (30 or more) for an illustrative map, and as low (less than 23) and high (23 or more) based on the median for a random effects regression model.all statistical analyses were conducted with stata 16 software (statacorp). daily covid-19 mortality during the covid-19 epidemic in europe was analyzed with multilevel mixed effects linear regression models. in the multilevel models, the dependent variable was the square root transformed daily mortality count. the count was based on daily follow-ups on covid-19 mortality cases for each country, starting from the first confirmed infection and ending april 14, 2020. this resulted in follow-up periods that varied between countries (from 82 days in france to 37 days in cyprus).to assess the relationship between the daily mortality count and our main theoretical variables, we conducted three separate models: model 1 included perceived sociability, model 2 included timing of national restrictions, and model 3 included institutional trust as an independent variable. all models controlled for the following between-country factors: average household size, population, population density, old-age dependency ratio, life expectancy at birth, health care expenditure per inhabitant, high tourist arrival (dummy variable based on median), and the length of the follow-up period for each country. in addition, our models included time as a within-country predictor of mortality. the end point of our follow-up period (april 14, 2020) was coded as the zero point for our time variable. preceding days had negative values in descending order until the first day of the country’s follow-up period. thus, time was used to estimate the within-country change in mortality during the epidemic, and the between-country variables estimated the country differences in mortality. except time and high tourist-arrival dummy variables, all independent variables were mean centered before adding them into the regression models.all models were conducted with maximum likelihood estimation. we estimated huber-white standard errors that were robust to within-country clustering and modelled our residuals to account for the autocorrelated error structure of our longitudinal data. the models included random intercept and random slope for time with unstructured covariances. we reported regression coefficients and corresponding 95% confidence intervals and p values for the fixed part of our models, and standard deviation with 95% confidence interval for the random effects.the progression of covid-19 mortality before and after the first covid-19 death were analyzed with random effects models to account for clustering at the country level. we modelled the amount of daily deaths in low and high institutional trust (cutoff point median value 23) after the first covid-19 death (time=0), which was used as a reference category. we then analyzed countries reacting late (restrictions placed after the first covid-19 death) and early (restrictions placed before the first covid-19 death). in both analyses each time point (day) was allowed to have a separate coefficient for the covid-19 mortality value (presented as deaths/million persons). models are presented as figures, and they are adjusted for population density, gender, old-age ratio, the proportion of those 65 years or older living with children, life expectancy, and tourist arrivals. models included country restrictions as daily varying dummies (0=no control, 1=control).descriptive statistics on the 25 european countries are shown in table 1. the spread of the covid-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but our findings reveal significant differences between countries. the most impacted countries in europe by april 14 are italy, spain, and france (see table 2). all of these countries were also significantly late to implement national restrictions. for example, italy placed national restrictions almost 2 weeks after the first covid-19 incident (see figure 1). france already had 1 death case in february and was the slowest to react nationwide. it is highly likely that during these days the virus was able to spread fast in the population, which explains the later mortality figures.our multilevel linear regression models analyzed the daily mortality in 25 countries (tables 3 and 4). the fixed effect of time was a significant predictor of mortality in all of the models, indicating the increasing trend in deaths during the crisis period. according to the random part of our models, however, there was a between-country variation in this trend. in addition to a within-country change, we found that between-country factors significantly predicted mortality. model 1 shows that the perceived sociability predicted higher daily mortality. model 2 shows that late restrictions were associated with higher numbers of covid-19 deaths. model 3 shows that institutional trust was negatively associated with daily covid-19 mortality figures. of our control variables, population density, life expectancy at birth, health care expenditure per inhabitant, high tourist arrival, and the length of the follow-up period were positively associated with daily mortality, yet the significance of these associations varied between models.the final part of the analysis focused on the role of institutional trust and reaction time. figure 2 shows the map of europe and the average number of deaths per million inhabitants in the analyzed 25 countries categorized in four country groups based on their level of institutional trust. the map demonstrates that those countries with low institutional trust have more deaths per million inhabitants on average compared to countries with high trust. we analyzed the difference between countries with low vs high perceived institutional trust using a random effects regression model. figure 3 shows development after the first covid-19 death case in low- and high-trust countries. there are no statistically significant differences between the curves. both curves indicate increases in mortality 2 weeks after the first covid-19 death case, and there were no statistically significant differences between them. figure 4 shows deaths per million inhabitants for countries reacting late and early. we can see how the number of deaths per day varied in the 24 days following the first national restrictions, and there is a statistically significant difference between the curves. increases in mortality were more rapid in those countries reacting late than those reacting early. for example, 23 days after the first covid-19 death there were 2.5 times more deaths in late-reacting countries (4.56 deaths/million, 95% ci 3.34-5.78) than in early reacting countries (1.83 deaths/million, 95% ci 1.02-2.65).the starting points for this study were the major country differences observed in covid-19 mortality and the related societal and cultural differences, as well as how people act in different societies during the current crisis situation. we analyzed social risk factors that may explain the spread of the covid-19, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust in an attempt to understand the prevailing country differences.our analysis showed that there were major variations in reactions to the worldwide epidemic. we were able to show that mortality was significantly associated with the studied social factors. perceived sociability was associated with higher covid-19 mortality even after adjusting for a number of control factors. this might be important in understanding why the virus has been able to spread so fast in some countries such as italy, which also has a dense population. the results also reflect previous cross-cultural findings showing that italians and spanish people have smaller social, personal, and intimate distances compared to many other european nations [8]. these countries also have strong intergenerational ties, which may explain why so many older adults got sick [31].one of the key points of our analysis is, however, that the covid-19 mortality is tied to societal processes. we found major differences in how fast countries were reacting to the covid-19 outbreak. compared to china, european countries had time to react, yet national restrictions were placed late. those countries that are now being hit the hardest by the disease were also the ones that were slowest to react nationwide, most notably italy, spain, and france. our models showed that late national restrictions predicted a higher number of deaths. despite the unity provided by the european union, european countries were not working together against the emerging disease threat, and the regulations progressed slowly, taking one step at a time. there were also delays in putting the restrictions into action. some countries have also taken different strategies to the covid-19 epidemic. in scandinavia, for example, sweden has adopted less restrictions than denmark, finland, and norway. sweden also had a higher number of deaths per inhabitants at the time of this writing. this example shows that even within similar neighboring countries national precautions to covid-19 have been different.we were able to demonstrate in our analysis that institutional trust was a protective factor. this is in line with previous studies indicating that people with higher institutional trust are more likely to follow the advice and guidelines given by the health authorities [16,17]. in our analysis, covid-19 mortality figures have progressed differently in low-trust countries and high-trust countries. remarkably, some low-trust countries such as italy, spain, and france were not only late in placing restrictions but had to place harder measures later, such as curfews, because people were simply not following the recommendations not to socialize with each other. despite hard measures, these countries have also had to sanction disobedient citizens. for example, the ministry of interior in italy reported intensive controls, and over 100,000 people were caught by the police for breaking the curfew [32].epidemiologists have not necessarily given enough attention to the societal and social psychological factors explaining epidemics. although there have been virus epidemics before, the crisis caused by covid-19 has created a unique global situation, demonstrating how poorly the previous epidemics (eg, sars and middle east respiratory syndrome) have prepared countries to deal with this disease [33]. what has made the covid-19 situation unique when compared to other epidemics, has been the rapid spread of the virus and the unusually hard restrictions placed to prevent physical contact and closeness between people. as european countries in general rely on individual freedom and democracy, it is difficult to close and shutdown societies completely. it becomes crucial to understand how different societies are capable of handling the crisis situation. this is typically reflected in the literature as societal resilience, and institutional trust is an important part of it [14]. as the crisis is not over, later developments will reveal what kind of role institutional trust eventually had on the wider picture, which also involves factors related to social contacts between people and timely restrictions placed within societies. our analysis was limited to a relatively short follow-up period and the inability to control for all possible factors involved. we also wish to note that variations across countries exist. this involves, for example, the fact that high-trust countries have adopted different societal strategies to tackle the covid-19 crisis. future studies should continue using social scientific evidence in the investigations of worldwide epidemics.bariatric surgery has been used for decades to treat patients with severe obesity. in 2016, global guidelines established through the diabetes surgery summit (dss), an international consensus conference series, formally recognised gastrointestinal surgery as a standard therapy for type 2 diabetes; this practice is known as metabolic surgery. 1 during the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) outbreak, under unprecedented pressure to free up inpatient capacity, and because of intraoperative risks for viral contagion among patients and staff, hospitals worldwide have been obliged to postpone most elective operations, including bariatric and metabolic surgery. increased hazards of severe covid-19 complications in patients with obesity, type 2 diabetes, or both, 2-5 further support the rationale for a pause in elective surgery during the peak of the pandemic.the return to normal services will be gradual, with surgeons competing for reduced capacity to address a backlog of elective procedures. hence, access to bariatric and metabolic surgery will continue to be constrained. given the uncertainty regarding the effects and duration of the covid-19 outbreak, combined with the progressive nature of obesity, diabetes, and related conditions, delaying bariatric and metabolic surgery could increase the risks for morbidity and mortality in surgical candidates. the risk of harm, however, is variable among individuals, depending on the type and severity of disease and their indications for bariatric and metabolic surgery. the traditional, weightcentric criteria for patient selection in bariatric surgery, which are still commonly used today, do not reflect severity of disease, 6 and they therefore cannot be used to prioritise treatment based on actual clinical needs. furthermore, physical distancing policies and continued lockdowns might limit adherence to lifestyle interventions, worsening metabolic deterioration among candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery. additionally, reduced access to nonurgent care during the covid-19 pandemic might impede postoperative monitoring for potential surgical and nutritional complications.a clear and urgent need therefore exists for strategies to mitigate harm to patients during and after the covid-19 pandemic. these approaches should include non-surgical interventions to optimise metabolic and weight control in patients awaiting surgery, telemedicine protocols for postoperative surveillance, and use of appropriate criteria to triage surgical candidates during a foreseeable period of reduced capacity for elective surgery. to address these issues, the dss 1 organisers directed a group of international experts to assess the effect of the covid-19 pandemic on candidates for surgical treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. our specific aim was to develop criteria to help prioritise bariatric and metabolic surgery for when elective surgery is resumed and beyond.elective surgery refers to operations that can be planned and scheduled in advance. these procedures, however, are not optional, because they can have important, lifechanging implications. when access to elective surgery is reduced, doctors should prioritise patients with the greatest need or with a greater risk of harm from delayed treatment. in some health-care systems, elective surgery is categorised into urgent, semi-urgent, or non-urgent. 7, 8 urgent elective surgery is required within 30 days for conditions that might deteriorate quickly. semi-urgent conditions are those that, although not likely to deteriorate quickly, could reasonably cause severe pain or dysfunction or further harm if delayed beyond 3 months. non-urgent elective surgery is planned for conditions that are unlikely to cause substantial discomfort, dysfunction, or harm if treated within 1 year.although some complications from bariatric and metabolic operations can require emergency surgical treatment (eg, haemorrhage, leak, or intestinal obstruction), most bariatric and metabolic procedures represent genuine elective surgery. to date, however, no consensus exists for criteria to identify urgent, semi-urgent, or nonurgent indications in bariatric and metabolic surgery on the basis of the type and severity of patients' conditions.there are many reasons why most bariatric and metabolic operations should be suspended during the most intense phase of the covid-19 pandemic, including infection risks among patients and staff, factors inherent to the operations, and increased hazards of severe covid-19 complications among patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes.laparoscopic surgery involves aerosol-generating techniques such as carbon dioxide, pneumoperitoneum, electro cautery, and ultrasonic shearing. these techniques could easily increase the risk of viral contagion for staff, 9, 10 including with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (another aerosol-producing procedure) is also commonly done before bariatric and metabolic surgery. patients undergoing major surgery are at risk of lifethreatening inflammatory complications such as infection (including from viruses), the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and sepsis. 11 although there is no conclusive evidence that laparoscopy or upper endoscopy can promote covid-19 transmission, postponing elective metabolic and bariatric interventions during the acute phase of the covid-19 outbreak seems sensible, except for urgent revisional surgery or emergency endoscopic interventions for complications (eg, haemorrhage, stoma stenosis, or leaks).despite the potential for a higher risk of contagion, the laparoscopic approach in bariatric and metabolic surgery is associated with substantial benefits compared with traditional open surgery, especially in patients with severe obesity. these benefits include lower rates of mortality and complications (including pulmonary and procedural), and shorter hospital stays. 12, 13 for these reasons, laparoscopic access should remain the preferred approach over open techniques when elective bariatric and metabolic surgery resumes. appropriate personal protective equipment should be used, however, given the increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection for staff.obesity increases the risk of complications from viral respiratory infections. during the 2009 influenza h1n1 pandemic in california, 91% of people who died had obesity, and higher bmi was associated with mortality. 14 in patients admitted to intensive care for sars-cov-2, class 2-3 obesity (bmi >35 kg/m²) is an independent risk factor for disease severity. 5 similarly, patients with diabetes have augmented risk for severe covid-19 and mortality. [2] [3] [4] [5] several mechanisms have been suggested to increase the risk of complications from viral infections in obesity and type 2 diabetes, including low-grade chronic inflammation with overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, reduced natural killer cell number and activity, and impaired antigen-stimulation responses. [15] [16] [17] another factor that might have a role in the relationship between obesity, diabetes, and increased risk for complications is that sars-cov-2 enters host cells by binding to the angiotensinconverting-enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor. ace2 transforms angiotensin 2 to angiotensin, 14-20 thereby reducing vaso constriction, sodium retention, inflammation, and metabolic degeneration. 21 chronic hyperglycaemia down regulates ace2 expression, 22 and further reduction of ace2 during covid-19 infection could contribute to hyperinflammation and respiratory failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. 23 people with obesity are also prone to hypoventilation syndrome, cardiovascular disease, 24 heart failure, 25 and other conditions that could increase the risk of covid-19 mortality.when elective bariatric and metabolic surgery resumes, the pandemic will be contained, but sars-cov-2 will probably still circulate in the population. given the risks of severe complications from covid-19 in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, we recommend that covid-19 screening should be mandatory preoperatively for patients considering bariatric and metabolic surgery.class 2-3 obesity and type 2 diabetes, the most common indications for bariatric and metabolic surgery, are associated with reduced quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality. their ability to cause lifethreatening complications, however, varies depending on the severity or stage of disease and the burden ofcomorbidities. the degree of harm from delaying metabolic and bariatric surgery depends on each patient's condition, the surgical efficacy at different stages of disease, and the availability and effectiveness of nonsurgical therapies to control disease progression while awaiting surgery. understanding the prognostic factors of morbidity and mortality in obesity and type 2 diabetes can help to define criteria for surgical prioritisation.diabetes is a major cause of morbidity and death, including from cardiovascular, renal, neurological, and retinal complications. approximately two-thirds of people with diabetes die of cardiovascular disease, with a relative risk 1·8-2·6 times greater than in people without diabetes. 26 the biological progression of type 2 diabetes, characterised by declining β-cell function and continuing insulin resistance, is manifested clinically by deteriorations in multiple parameters, including hba 1c , fasting, and postprandial glucose levels. the uk prospective diabetes study 27 reported significant associations between hyperglycaemia and development of diabetes complications or death, and a 21% risk reduction for any diabetes-related endpoint with each 1% absolute hba 1c reduction.factors beyond hyperglycaemia can also influence type 2 diabetes prognosis. in the triad study, 28, 29 predictors of all-cause mortality at 4 years and 8 years of study follow-up included older age, male sex, non-hispanic white race, lower education and income, longer duration of diabetes, lower bmi, hypertension, macrovascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. among the specific predictors of cardiovascular mortality were also treatment with insulin (with or without oral medication), higher ldl cholesterol, history of nephropathy, transient ischaemic attack, stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease, and use of antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering medications.obesity increases the risks of many other illnesses, including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, liver disease, coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease, many cancers, cholelithiasis, infertility, psychosocial dys function, osteoarthritis, chronic kidney disease, and now also covid-19. together, these complications power fully reduce quality of life and exacerbate obesity-associated mortality. even before covid-19, obesity reduced life expectancy by 5-20 years. 30 notably, higher all-cause mortality is associated with obesity class 2 (bmi 35-39·9 kg/m²) and 3 (bmi ≥40 kg/m²), corresponding to candidates for bariatric surgery, but not with class 1 obesity (bmi 30-34·9 kg/m²). 31 obesity hypoventilation syndrome and obesity-associated heart failure substantially increase mortality. obesity hypoventilation syndrome represents the combination of obesity and chronic daytime hypercapnia. 32, 33 the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is highest among patients with a bmi of more than 50 kg/m². 34 mortality from untreated obesity hypoventilation syndrome can be as high as 24% at 1·5-2 years after diagnosis. 35 obesity heart failure is associated with increased mortality, and for each 5-unit increase in bmi, heart failure-related mortality increases by 1·4 times. 36 since bmi alone does not reflect obesity-related mortality and morbidity, staging systems such as the king's obesity criteria 37 and edmonton obesity staging system (eoss) 38 have been developed to assess individual patients' risk on the basis of evidence of subclinical, established, or endstage comorbidities. 39 retrospective application of eoss to data from the national health and nutrition examination survey showed that patients in stages 2-4 of eoss have increased all-cause mortality compared with stages 0 or 1. this finding supports the idea that the presence, type, and severity of obesity-related complications, in addition to bmi, 39 should inform decision making about the prioritisation of treatment, especially surgery.non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is characterised by excess hepatic fat. its more aggressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, includes hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. [40] [41] [42] these two conditions affect 20-25% of the western population, with rates rising worldwide. 40,43 66% of patients with obesity and diabetes have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. 44, 45 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can lead to cirrhosis (in 15-20% of cases), liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. 46 beyond liver-related mortality, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis can substantially increase microvascular and macrovascular complications, and cardiovascular mortality in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. [40] [41] [42] [43] 47, 48 non-randomised trials suggest that roux-en-y gastric bypass resolves the histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in up to 80% of patients. 49, 50 randomised clinical trials and observational studies show that in patients with all classes of obesity, bariatric and metabolic surgery promotes greater long-term weight loss than the best available non-surgical interventions, regardless of the operation chosen. 47, [51] [52] [53] multiple obser vational studies also indicate that bariatric and metabolic surgery lowers long-term risk of all-cause mortality compared with matched non-surgical patients. [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] data from eight observational studies involving a total of 635 642 patients suggest that bariatric and metabolic surgery is associated with a reduced risk of all types of cancer (odds ratio [or]=0·72; 95% ci 0·59-0·87) and obesity-associated cancer (or=0·55; 95% ci 0·31-0·96). [60] [61] [62] without exception, each of the 29 all-cause mortality studies published to date shows that patients who have bariatric and metabolic surgery live longer than matched nonsurgical controls. 54-59,63,64concerning type 2 diabetes, at least 12 randomised controlled trials comparing bariatric and metabolic surgery with conventional diabetes therapies (ie, lifestyle plus medication) in patients with type 2 diabetes show that surgery is superior for control of hyperglycaemia, reduction of cardiovascular and overall mortality risk, improvement in quality of life, and reduction in risk of renal complications. 1, 65, 66 the safety of bariatric and metabolic surgery compares favourably with that of most elective operations, including hysterectomy, chole cystectomy, and knee replacement. surgical treatments for diabetes are highly cost-effective, with the cost per quality-adjusted lifeyear ranging between us$3200 and $13 000. 1, 65, 67 based on this evidence, dss guidelines, which have been formally endorsed by 56 worldwide medical or scientific organisations and recognised by payers worldwide, recommend the consideration of bariatric and metabolic surgery for appropriate candidates (including those with only class 1 obesity), who do not achieve adequate glycaemic control with medical therapy. 1the delay of bariatric and metabolic surgery that is occurring due to covid-19 will augment the burden of disease among surgical candidates. this increase will particularly affect patients with type 2 diabetes, given that metabolic surgery causes remission of hyperglycaemia in most cases. 65 the likelihood of hyperglycaemia remission, however, depends upon how soon an operation is done during the natural history of diabetes. algorithms designed to predict surgical remission (eg, diarem-2, ad-diarem, diabetter, and abcd) [68] [69] [70] [71] consistently show that longstanding disease is one of the most powerful indicators of failure to achieve this benefit. 72 remission rates drop off notably after 10 years of diabetes. moreover, the sos study 73 reported substantially lower type 2 diabetes remission among patients with only 4 years of known disease than in those with 2 years of known disease. thus, delaying metabolic surgery reduces the chances of diabetes remission.delayed metabolic surgery might cause even greater harm to patients with type 2 diabetes who are at higher risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality, especially when medications and lifestyle interventions are not achieving adequate metabolic control. patients without diabetes but with severe respiratory (obesity hypoventilation syndrome), cardiac, or renal complications of obesity, and individuals for whom weight reduction is crucial to advancing time-sensitive and life-saving treatments (eg, organ transplants) also have greater risks of harm from delaying bariatric and metabolic surgery.patients with surgically remediable metabolic diseases, especially diabetes, incur more health-care costs per day than do those without these conditions. all studies that compared costs for 1-5 years between surgical and non-surgical patients found that pharmacy expenses decrease substantially after bariatric and metabolic surgery compared with matched non-surgical patients, [74] [75] [76] [77] 78 primarily due to lower diabetes medication costs. 69 hence, metabolic surgery decreases daily health-care costs, especially for patients requiring multidrug therapy. the longer surgery is delayed for these patients, the less costsaving it becomes.various non-surgical options can be used to mitigate the harm from delaying bariatric and metabolic surgery and to manage patients who have had surgery (panel 1).regarding the need to optimise glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, especially those with advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, 79 we considered available evidence of pharmacological strategies that promote weight loss, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (glp-1ra) or sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (sglt-2) inhibitors, or both. 80 glp-1ras reduce hba 1c by about 1% 81 while promoting clinically relevant weight loss. 82 sglt-2 inhibitors, however, might be contraindicated with covid-19, because of concerns about potential subclinical vascular congestion and risk of acute metabolic decompensation associated with these drugs. 83 we also considered available data regarding the efficacy of dietary or pharmacological interventions for weight loss, 84, [85] [86] [87] [88] or both, as a strategy to achieve weight loss or weight maintenance in patients with multiple weightresponsive comorbidities who face prolonged waiting times for bariatric and metabolic surgery. regarding strategies to maximise surgical outcomes in patients who have already had surgery, our recommendations are based on results from studies investigating the efficacy of pharmacological approaches in people with persistent or recurrent type 2 diabetes after surgery. among these individuals, a recent study 89 showed that the glp-1ra liraglutide can reduce hba 1c by 1·2%, with up to 5% additional weight loss. we reviewed existing evidencebased recommendations for postoperative nutritional care 79 to define safe and pragmatic methods of virtual consultation by telemedicine (panel 1).even before the covid-19 pandemic, metabolic and bariatric surgery was underused for many reasons, including misconceptions and stigma about obesity and bariatric surgery. 90 such barriers might further penalise candidates for this surgery in times of limited resources. given the seriousness of the diseases that require metabolic and bariatric surgery, clinicians, hospital managers, and policy makers should ensure that these operations are not further delayed because of the widespread misconception that they are a last resort. 90eventually, the covid-19 crisis will abate, and elective operations will resume, leaving an enormous backlog of patients who would benefit from bariatric and metabolic surgery. how should we prioritise whom to serve first with limited resources? at a broad level, the answer is simple. if patients are well enough to be safe surgical candidates, preference should be afforded to those with the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality from their disease, if it is probable that this risk can be reduced by surgery. this logic would apply, for instance, to many surgical candidates with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes or substantial metabolic, respiratory, or cardiovascular disease.traditional bmi-centric criteria for patient selection, however, tend to skew access to bariatric and metabolic surgery in the opposite direction. despite strong evidence that surgery achieves its greatest health benefits among patients with type 2 diabetes, a minority of those who have such operations have preoperative type 2 diabetes or cardiometabolic disease. 91 furthermore, in many publicly funded health-care systems (eg, uk national health service), candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery are currently placed on a single elective surgery waiting list, regardless of their indication. priority is established largely on a first-come first-served basis, rather than onnon-surgical options to mitigate harm from delaying surgery • glycaemic control should be optimised in patients awaiting metabolic surgery for type 2 diabetes, especially for those with advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications; this is desirable to prepare for surgery and also in case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection • in patients who do not achieve glycaemic targets with lifestyle modifications and metformin, the addition of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (glp-1ra) or sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (sglt-2) inhibitor, or both, can advance the combined goals of improving metabolic control and causing weight loss or limiting weight gain; use of sglt-2 inhibitors, however, is not recommended in the case of acute coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection because of concerns about potential subclinical vascular congestion and risk of acute metabolic decompensation associated with these drugs • for patients with multiple weight-responsive comorbidities who face prolonged waiting times for surgery, dietary or pharmacological interventions for weight control might become necessary • diets with higher protein content and lower glycaemic index can be effective and should be considered • among patients already taking weight-loss medications, efforts should be made to continue the drug(s) until surgery is scheduled, since rapid weight regain is predictable when they are discontinued • in countries where weight-loss medications (eg, phentermine, orlistat, glp-1ras, naltrexone-bupropion, and phenterminetopiramate) are accessible, clinicians could consider their use when weight loss or weight maintenance is important, such as for patients with multiple weight-responsive comorbidities• telemedicine strategies that are supervised by specialist bariatric and metabolic surgery providers should be used • in people with persistent or recurrent type 2 diabetes after surgery, weight-reducing diabetes medications (eg, glp-1ras) should be considered; weight maintenance should also be encouraged in patients with type 2 diabetes remission to mitigate risk of disease recurrence • there is insufficient evidence to justify deviations from current evidence-based recommendations for postoperative nutritional care in patients who have had bariatric and metabolic surgery • to minimise risk of nutrition-related complications, providers should engage with patients at the same intervals as in current guidelines • clinical signs (eg, weight, visual changes, rash, weakness, oedema or anasarca, and neuropsychiatric signs), and symptoms (eg, nausea, tingling, bowel-habit changes, and fatigue) of nutritional deficiency must be assessed during virtual clinic sessions • routine laboratory tests (eg, albumin, thiamine, b12, vitamin a, vitamin d, iron, and calcium) should not be deferred but obtained at standard intervals, particularly for patients who had operations with greater risk of nutrient malabsorption, such as long-limb diversionary procedures • urgent face-to-face meetings and laboratory tests are mandated when symptoms suggest severe biochemical deficiencies or surgical complications (eg, intestinal obstruction or acute cholecystitis)• misconceptions and stigma about obesity and bariatric and metabolic surgery might further penalise candidates for surgical treatment of obesity and diabetes in times of limited resources; clinicians, policy makers, and hospital managers should recognise the seriousness of the diseases that require metabolic and bariatric surgery and ensure that these operations are not further delayed • given the risks of severe complications from covid-19 in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, covid-19 screening should be mandatory preoperatively for patients considering bariatric and metabolic surgery • despite the potential higher risk of contagion for staff, the risk and benefit of a laparoscopic approach remain favourable for patients and should be preferred over the use of open techniques • appropriate personal protective equipment should be used as recommended by professional bodies and public health agencies to minimise risk for staff and operatorsclinical need. this approach is comparable to putting all colorectal surgery candidates on the same waiting list with similar priority, regardless of whether their diagnosis is cancer or benign neoplasia. a strong need therefore exists for clinically sound criteria to help prioritise access to surgery in times of pandemics with limited resources. these criteria can also inform future waiting list management and decision making about the structure of surgical services.the prioritisation of any elective operation should seek to facilitate access according to clinical need, maximise equity of access, and minimise the harm from delayed access. we have adapted previous categorisations of elective surgery 7 to define an objective prioritisation system reflecting these principles for bariatric and meta bolic operations (panel 2; figure) . given the factors contributing to morbidity and mortality in obesity and type 2 diabetes, surgical prioritisation should be based on disease-specific consider ations. for patients with type 2 diabetes, we suggest that surgery be prioritised for patients at increased risk of morbidity and mortality. this risk would be indicated by poor glycaemic control despite maximal medical therapy, use of insulin, previous cardiovascular disease, albuminuria and chronic kidney disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or multiple cardio metabolic comorbidities. 28 insulin use is a meaningful prioritisation criterion because it correlates with increased cardiovascular mortality 28 and reduced quality of life. 92 moreover, metabolic surgery reduces or abolishes the figure: examples of conditions that warrant expedited access to bariatric and metabolic surgery aha=american heart association. the severity of obesity-associated symptoms (eg, mobility issues or joint pain as a consequence of extremely high bmi, regardless of comorbidities) must also be considered when establishing priorities. equally important is the effect of obesity-related conditions that increase morbidity and mortality (eg, obesity hypo ventilation syndrome, chronic kidney disease, or severe obstructive sleep apnoea). 38 the availability of non-surgical options that slow disease progression (ie, pharmacological diabetes treatments achieving adequate glycaemic control) reduces need for prior itisation. expedited access to surgery should also be considered when bariatric and metabolic operations are used as adjuvant therapy to enable other time-sensitive treatments that are made unfeasible or unsafe by excess weight, poor metabolic control, or both (figure).many candidates for bariatric and metabolic surgery are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from comorbid conditions. for these patients, access to surgical treatment should be prioritised on the basis of disease-focused clinical needs, rather than primarily on bmi, to mitigate harm from delaying surgery. this approach is especially needed in periods in which access to surgery is reduced, as in the current covid-19 pandemic. societal crises often spur developments that provide benefits long after the storm passes. disease-oriented, medically meaningful strategies to triage patients seeking metabolic surgery after the covid-19 crisis should help prioritise patients in more urgent need, both now and long into the future.fr conceived the idea for this initiative. fr, rvc, gm, cwr, jim, dea, jv, and dec reviewed relevant medical literature and prepared the first draft of this report. ga, saa, rlb, sb, gc, sdp, jbd, rhe, dh, bmm, apan, apat, fp, prs, and pzz provided additional input in the appraisal of evidence and in manuscript preparation. all co-authors participated in the development of the recommendations and reviewed and approved this report. we did a rapid narrative literature review for this personal view. for references about the effect of viral infections including coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) on diabetes, obesity, and laparoscopic surgery, we searched pubmed for articles in english published between jan 1, 2002, and april 10, 2020. we used combinations of terms such as "sars", "h1n1", "coronavirus", "covid-19", "sars-cov-2", "diabetes", "obesity", "bmi" "laparoscopy", "endoscopy", "severe acute respiratory syndrome", "acute respiratory distress syndrome", and "co-morbidities".we also reviewed recent guidelines from professional organisations and public health agencies about elective surgery and the covid-19 pandemic. for evidence about the benefits of bariatric and metabolic surgery, the predicting factors of morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and the classification of elective surgery, we reviewed recently published systematic reviews and consensus statements by major scientific societies and relevant individual articles cited in these documents.members of the expert panel were selected on the basis of their previous participation in the diabetes surgery summit series and their relevant expertise. additional experts were also invited to join the group and provide complementary expertise or ensure global representation, or both. a subgroup of the expert panel did a first appraisal of the evidence and draft recommendations, and they generated the first draft of the report, synthetising the literature review in response to each specific query. the entire expert group then engaged in online discussion to further appraise the evidence and refine the final consensus recommendations.the temporal dynamics of viral pathogens depend on several factors, including transmission properties of the virus, and the survival, immune response and spatial distribution of the hosts (e.g. may 1983; anderson & may 1991) . in general, viruses that show low pathogenicity and prolonged infectious-ness are likely to exhibit relatively high and constant prevalence (anderson & may 1979a ) and can therefore be termed`endemic.' in contrast, viruses that spread rapidly, have a shorter duration of infectiousness and cause higher host mortality (or immunity) are more likely to generate discrete epidemics (anderson & may 1979b) . epidemic diseases are characterized by rapid changes in the prevalence of infection and may disappear from the host population for extended periods. such pathogens are likely to require high host densities for invasion and persistence, and the extent of outbreaks should increase with the size of the susceptible host population (may 1983; onstad & carruthers 1990; anderson & may 1982; jaee et al. 1992) .the population-level impact of viral infections will depend on their eects on host survival and reproduction (may 1983; dobson & mccallum 1995) . recent empirical and theoretical studies have shown that virulence can be advantageous to the parasite and is not necessarily a side-eect of novel host±parasite combinations (e.g. allison 1982; ewald 1983; anderson & may 1991; herre 1993; lenski & may 1994; levin 1996) . although transient impacts of novel parasites can be immense, few studies have addressed the long-term eects of disease in wildlife populations (grenfell & gulland 1995) . most wildlife diseases are studied via incidental post mortems, and manipulative experiments in natural populations are often impossible (dobson & mccallum 1995) .viruses have been implicated as the cause of several major declines in carnivore populations (young 1994) . for example, canine distemper virus (cdv) killed over 70% of the last remaining colony of freeliving black-footed ferrets (thorne & williams 1988) and phocine distemper killed over 18 000 harbour seals in northern europe (osterhaus & vedder 1988) . rabies has been suggested to cause population decline in wolves, ethiopian wolves and african wild dogs (e.g. macdonald 1980; kat et al. 1995; weiler, garner & ritter 1995; sillero, king & macdonald 1996; ballard & krausman 1997; laurenson et al. 1998) . perhaps the best-studied example is the canine distemper virus (cdv) outbreak that struck the serengeti lions and several other species in late 1993±early 1994 (roelke-parker et al. 1996 ; also see alexander & appel 1994; alexander et al. 1995) . cdv originated from the large population of domestic dogs surrounding the serengeti ecosystem and killed 35% of the serengeti lions within 6 months. over 85% of the lions were infected, and many victims showed neurological disorders, encephalitis, and pneumonia. while this outbreak followed a well-de®ned onset, many other viral epidemics have been inferred solely from crosssectional serological surveys (e.g. olmsted et al. 1992; spencer & morkel 1993; creel et al. 1997 ) and detailed/long-term investigations of virus±carnivore interactions are rare (grenfell & gulland 1995; dobson & mccallum 1995) .in the present study, we evaluate temporal changes in the exposure of african lions to six different viruses. these viruses show a variety of transmission modes, symptoms and durations of infectiousness in domestic carnivores (table 1) . for example, both feline immunode®ciency virus (fiv, a lentivirus closely associated with hiv) and feline herpesvirus permanently infect their hosts and do not elicit lasting immunity (table 1 ). in contrast, canine distemper virus (cdv), feline calicivirus, feline coronavirus and feline parvovirus generally cause only temporary infection, although a small proportion of infected hosts may persist as asymptomatic carriers. using serological data from two different lion populations, we ®rst classify these viruses as either endemic or epidemic. we estimate the timing of each epidemic by combining the temporal pattern of seroprevalence with information on the lions' ages at the time of sampling. we then examine the relationship between the extent of each epidemic, and the proportion and density of susceptible hosts in the population. finally, we measure the impact of viral infection on lion mortality and birth rates.lions have been studied continuously in the serengeti since march 1966 and in the ngorongoro crater since 1963 (packer, tatar & collins 1998) . all animals are individually recognized from natural markings (packer & pusey 1993 ) and most have been regularly observed since birth (pusey & packer 1994) , and thus the precise age is known for each individual. blood samples were collected in the serengeti each year between 1984 , and the crater lions were sampled in 1984 , 1985 and 1991 table 2 for annual sample sizes). these samples were originally collected for genetic assay (o'brien et al. 1987; packer et al. 1991a,b) and to investigate the cdv outbreak in 1994 (roelke-parker et al. 1996) . serological assays were later performed to assess the lions' exposure to fiv (olmsted et al. 1992; brown et al. 1994) , cdv (roelke-parker et al. 1996) , and feline leukaemia, herpes-, parvo-, corona-and calicivirus . over 300 lions were also tested for felv, but none showed detectable levels of antigens . table 3 summarizes the precise assays and criteria used to determine sero-status for the remaining six viruses. many animals were tested repeatedly, and repeat samples are included in any descriptive analysis, but excluded from all statistical tests unless an animal seroconverted.lions are considered to be`immatures' until 4 years of age. most females do not start breeding until well after their third birthday, while males do not attain breeding status until they are about 5 years old (packer et al. 1988 (packer et al. , 1998 . the serengeti study area covers the south-eastern quarter of the serengeti national park. this 2000 km 2 area consists of two contrasting habitats: acacia woodland and opengrass plains (see packer et al. 1988) . lions on the plains live at lower densities and endure lower levels of food availability than their woodlands counter- parts. the ngorongoro crater is located about 90 km to the south-east of the serengeti study area, and the crater lions enjoy higher and more consistent levels of food availability than the serengeti lions (hanby, bygott & packer 1995) . however, the crater is a small, isolated population (80±100 animals) with an associated loss in genetic diversity compared to the much larger serengeti population (o'brien et al. 1987; packer et al. 1991b) , which includes an estimated 2000±3000 animals (schaller 1972; hanby & bygott 1978) .adult serostatus usually indicates prior exposure to the virus, rather than current infection, since an older animal may still be carrying antibodies from a childhood disease (see below). therefore, seroprevalence in young animals provides stronger evidence of a recent exposure and, if all the younger cohorts are seronegative, the virus has probably been absent for several years. under these assumptions, we ®rst use the seroprevalence data to determine whether each virus was`endemic' or`epidemic' over a 10year period. we then provide estimates for the tim-ing of speci®c outbreaks of the epidemic viruses based on sudden changes in the frequency of seropositive hosts.consistent with a pattern of chronic infection, the lion populations showed constant and high levels of seroprevalence for fiv and feline herpes virus.rates of fiv infection did not vary signi®cantly across years for either adults or immatures (fig. 1a ) or by sex (cf. courchamp et al. 1998) . combining data from all years, small cubs quickly seroconverted to fiv+ , and this trend was similar in the serengeti and ngorongoro crater (fig. 2 ). all but two of 374 animals in the serengeti and ngorongoro were positive for herpes virus (fig. 1b) , including all eight cubs sampled before their ®rst birthday.each of the remaining four viruses appeared to be absent from the serengeti for 4±12 years followed by a sudden resurgence in the frequency of seropositive hosts (fig. 3) . the sporadic nature of these widespread infections is most conspicuous in the youngest age classes, and the precise timing of each outbreak diered between the serengeti and ngorongoro crater. cdv. seroprevalence varied between years in the serengeti in both adults and immatures (fig. 3a) . the sharp rise in 1993±94 in cdv seroprevalence of adults and immatures was due to the outbreak documented by roelke-parker et al. (1996) , whereas the declining adult seroprevalence in the mid-1980s re¯ected an earlier outbreak. the ngorongoro crater lions also appear to have been infected before 1984, with no further epidemics before the end of the sampling period in 1991 (see fig. 4 ).parvovirus. annual seroprevalence of adult lions varied somewhat in the serengeti, and the seroprevalence of immatures varied signi®cantly among years (fig. 3b) . immatures showed the highest frequency of exposure in 1985 (see hofmann-lehmann et al. 1996) and in 1992. none of the immatures in ngorongoro crater tested positive for parvovirus (see below).coronavirus. annual seroprevalence in the serengeti only varied signi®cantly in immatures (fig. 3c) . in ngorongoro crater, there was evidence of new infections between 1984 and 1991, but our sample size was inadequate to con®rm signi®cant variation between years.calicivirus. seroprevalence varied across years in the serengeti, but varied most dramatically in immatures ( fig. 3d ). immatures showed the highest seroprevalence in 1985 and 1990/91. calicivirus was absent from ngorongoro crater .the four`epidemic' viruses showed¯uctuating prevalence in each study population, often increasing in discrete outbreaks. the timing of these outbreaks can be estimated from the seroprevalence data in conjunction with the age of each study animal. for example, out of all the serengeti lions sampled between 1984 and october 1993, only those animals that had been born before july 1981 were seropositive for cdv (fig. 4a ). every lion born after 1981 was seronegative for cdv until 1993/94, when a new epidemic swept through the population, infecting lions of all ages (fig. 4b ). this pattern strongly suggests that the virus had been absent from the serengeti from 1981 until the end of 1993. data from ngorongoro suggest that cdv infected the crater lions sometime in 1980, but then disappeared from the population for the following 11 years: the youngest seropositive animal had been born in june 1980, but no animal born later than this date had been infected by the end of our last sampling eort in 1991 (fig. 4c ).similar heterogeneities in the age-prevalence data could be discerned for the other three viruses and one example from each virus is plotted in fig. 5 . we interpret the marked discontinuities in seroprevalence for these viruses to indicate a high rate of infection, similar to the cdv outbreak of 1994 (fig. 4b) . in support of this assumption, almost all of the putative outbreaks simultaneously infected multiple prides and included cubs as well as adults. the only exception was an outbreak of calicivirus in crater. virtually every animal has been infected with fiv by their 4th birthday, although lions in the serengeti plains show a lower rate of infection than the other two habitats (t = ± 3´54, p < 0´001), even when controlling for age in a multivariate analysis (eect of age: t = 5´94, p < 0´001; eect of serengeti plains: t = ±3´89, p < 0´001).1987 that infected only a few members of a single pride located along the northern boundary of our serengeti study area. the approximate end-dates of outbreaks of each virus are summarized in table 4 . except for the 1994 cdv epidemic (where comparable data are not yet available), these dates are presumed to have been the beginning of prolonged intervals where no new seroconversions occurred.besides these extreme discontinuities in exposure, the seroprevalence data also suggest several earlier outbreaks through a`stair-step' pattern. for example, fig. 4a shows that virtually all animals born between 1970 and 1977 were seropositive for cdv during the 1984±93 sampling period, whereas animals born in 1978±81 showed a consistently lower prevalence. this pattern may be most easily explained by two epidemics that ended in 1977 and 1981. a similar pattern is evident for calicivirus, where separate epidemics resulted in a higher sero-prevalence for animals born in 1979±86 than for those born in 1987±90 (fig. 5c ).if these viruses do occur in discrete epidemics, antibody titres and seroprevalence should both decline in the years following an outbreak because the strength of each individual's immune response weakens through time. however, we only resampled enough individuals to test this prediction directly for two viruses. fifteen parvo+ animals were resampled between the 1985 and 1992 parvovirus outbreaks. their titre levels declined signi®cantly (n = 13 animals whose titre levels changed, t = 15, p < 0´05 signed-ranks test), and two seropositive animals became seronegative after 1´25 and 4´25 years, respectively. only two cdv+ animals were resampled in the 1980s, and both showed a decline in antibody titres between 1985 and 1987.including all animals that were old enough to have been exposed to each virus, seroprevalence consistently declined after the presumed end of each fig. 3 . annual seroprevalence in the serengeti for cdv, parvovirus, coronavirus and calicivirus. note: the statistical analyses only include those years with sucient sample size (n r 5) to perform chi-square tests. (a) cdv: seroprevalence of adults varied signi®cantly across years (w 2 = 34´65, d.f. = 6, p = 0´0000), but varied even more in younger lions (w 2 = 132´3, d.f. = 5, p = 0´0000). (b) parvovirus: seroprevalence of adults varied non-signi®cantly across years (w 2 = 11´94, d.f. = 6, p = 0´0633), but varied signi®cantly in younger animals (w 2 = 56´94, d.f. = 5, p < 0´0000). (c) coronavirus: seroprevalence of adults did not vary across years (w 2 = 1´99, d.f. = 6, p = 0´9203), but varied signi®cantly in younger lions (w 2 = 20´90, d.f. = 5, p = 0´0008). (d) calicivirus: seroprevalence of adults varied across years (w 2 = 15´66, d.f. = 6, p = 0´0157), but varied more in younger animals (w 2 = 73´62, d.f. = 5, p = 0´0000). epidemic (fig. 6 ). responses to three viruses (cdv, calici-and parvovirus) declined at a remarkably similar rate, but coronavirus response declined more rapidly. as predicted, individual titre levels also declined through time for cdv (t = ±8´08, n = 139 seropositive animals, p < 0´0001, r 2 = 0´3209) and parvovirus (t = ±5´96, n = 233 seropositives, p < 0´0001, r 2 = 0´1333), although not for coronavirus (t = ±0´35, n = 179, p = 0´7266). because of batch eects in the calicivirus assays, elisa values could not be tested. note that titre levels also declined with the animal's age at the end of each epidemic for both cdv (p = 0´0162) and parvovirus (p < 0´0001), but the drop through time after each epidemic remained highly signi®cant in a multiple regression model that controlled for age (p < 0´0001, with the eect of age also signi®cant at p < 0´0001).epidemics should be more frequent and more extensive in large host populations, and there is some indication that viral outbreaks varied according to the overall host population size. figure 7 shows the size of the study populations in the serengeti and ngorongoro crater over the past 20 + years, as well as the approximate timing of the outbreaks listed in table 4 . in the serengeti, both corona-and parvovirus typically occurred in years of high population density. our study areas include three contrasting habitats with associated dierences in lion density. calicivirus was absent from the small, isolated crater population. prevalence after each coronavirus outbreak was lower (w 2 = 12´63, p < 0´001, n = 221) in the low-density serengeti plains (where prides are small and pride ranges are 150±500 km 2 ) than in the adjacent woodlands (where prides are large and pride ranges are 40±75 km 2 ). age-prevalence of fiv was also lowest in the plains (fig. 2) ; a pattern similar to domestic cats where fiv prevalence is lower in low-density areas (malik et al. 1997) .although total host density was associated with changes in disease prevalence in the above cases, epidemiological theory speci®es that only the suscep-tible subset of hosts will regulate the invasion and rate of spread of viral infection. in the following sections, we therefore estimated the size of the susceptible population for each virus through time, and we use these estimates to evaluate the association between susceptible host density and viral outbreaks.because our serological survey included a small subset of the study populations and our sample size varied from year to year (table 2) , we can only provide rough estimates of the overall number of susceptibles. we base these estimates on the following simplifying assumptions: (i) every animal in the population was exposed to the virus during each outbreak; (ii) survivors of each outbreak gained immunity that persisted over their remaining life-spans; thus (iii) only animals born after the most recent outbreak were`susceptible' to viral infection. these assumptions clearly underestimate the size of the susceptible population because, ®rst, it is unlikely that 100% of the population is exposed to the virus during an outbreak, and, secondly, a proportion of seropositive animals may lose their immunity over time (as implied by fig. 6) . however, in the absence of complete information, this procedure at least provides a standardized estimate of the minimum number of susceptibles in the population.the total number of`new susceptibles' (i.e. individuals born after an epidemic who had not yet been exposed to the virus) is presented in fig. 8 . note that this analysis is restricted to the serengeti, since estimates require at least two outbreaks of the same virus. for parvovirus and calicivirus, successive outbreaks occurred shortly after the population crossed an apparent threshold number of new susceptibles: parvovirus outbreaks occurred after the number of new susceptibles reached 150 animals, whereas calicivirus outbreaks required at least 90 new susceptibles. in contrast, there were no consistent patterns for cdv (with the 1981 outbreak coinciding with only 70 new susceptibles vs. 250 susceptibles in late 1993) or coronavirus (approximately 80 susceptibles in 1988 vs. approximately 160 in 1992). in the case of cdv, it is important to note that the lions should not be measured in isolation: cdv infected large numbers of serengeti canids in the late 1970s and early 1980s, so the true number of susceptibles in the ecosystem should also include these other host species. table 4 . dates when viral epidemics are presumed to have ended.`pattern' distinguishes between two situations;`presence/ absence' indicates that consecutive cohorts were seronegative whereas older cohorts were largely seropositive; and`stairstep' designates when consecutive cohorts were moderately seropositive, while older cohorts showed even higher seroprevalence.`signi®cance' refers to the dierence in seroprevalence between cohorts born within the 4 years prior to the endpoint vs. those born in the ®rst 4 years thereafter (as tested by w 2 with 1 d.f.). the 1976 parvovirus, and 1988 and 1993 coronavirus epidemics all showed the same qualitative pattern as the statistically robust outbreaks, and are therefore included in subsequent analyses. however, the 1987 calicivirus outbreak is omitted from further consideration, because only a small proportion of at-risk individuals became seropositive, and all three of these animals lived in the same pride at the edge of the study area presence/absence p < 0´001, n = 54 fig. 6 . seroprevalence plotted as a function of the number of years that had elapsed after the presumed end of each epidemic. data are restricted to animals who were alive during the putative outbreak and thus who could have been exposed to the virus. the decline in seroprevalence through time was statistically signi®cant for all four viruses (cdv: t = ±4´88, p < 0´001, n = 223, logistic regression; parvovirus: t = ±4´81, p < 0´001, n = 277; coronavirus: t = ±2´46, 0 = 0´014, n = 293; calicivirus: t = ±4´31, p = 0´001, n = 240). these all remain signi®cant when other age eects are included in a multivariate logisticregression analysis.to estimate the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during each outbreak, we recalculated the annual seroprevalence of the serengti lions. in this analysis, we assumed that seronegative animals had never been infected between birth and the time they were sampled. we assumed that seropositive animals had been seropositive each year following the most recent outbreak for that particular virus, but we made no assumptions about their serostatus prior to the most recent outbreak. in this way, the age and serostatus of sampled lions was used not only to estimate seroprevalence in the year sampled, but also in previous years (thus reducing the random variance produced by small sample sizes). these estimates are presented in fig. 9 , and they are broadly similar to the raw data presented in fig. 3 . however, these estimates interpolate data for the years 1988±92 (when few samples were collected) and extrapolate backwards to years before our serological samples were collected. most important, fig. 9 provides an approximation of the magnitude of each outbreak. for example, the 1993±94 cdv outbreak struck when the population was entirely seronegative and over 85% of the population seroconverted in the course of the epidemic. in contrast, the 1990 calicivirus epidemic struck when nearly 30% of the population was seropositive for calicivirus, and seroprevalence only increased to about 50%.we used these data to estimate the extent of each outbreak. we de®ne`incidence' as the proportion of susceptibles that became seropositive during the time course of a single outbreak. thus, an increase in seroprevalence from 20 to 90% indicates a reduction in susceptibles from 80 to 10%, and an`incidence' of 0´70/0´80 = 0´875; an increase in seroprevalence from 55 to 60% would give an`incidence' of 0´05/0´45 = 0´111. using data from all four viruses, fig. 10 shows that epidemics with the highest`incidence' were associated with the highest initial proportion of susceptibles. this trend verges on statistical signi®cance if restricted to the well-de®ned epidemics listed in table 4 (arcsine-transformed linear regression: t = ±2´49, r 2 = 0´5535, n = 7, p = 0´0552), and the relationship becomes highly signi®cant if we include the 1987 calicivirus table 4 ) and horizontal lines show the span over which samples were collected.`outbreak' that did not spread beyond a single pride (t = ±4´21, r 2 = 0´7434, n = 8, p = 0´0056).although the overall trend in fig. 10 is quite striking, the data are based on very rough approximations and on only 1±3 outbreaks per virus. within each virus, only calicivirus shows a trend in the same direction as the overall pattern. the paired outbreaks of parvovirus and coronavirus show slight trends in the opposite direction to the overall pattern, but it is perhaps more noteworthy that the two points in each pair are so similar. this suggests that epidemics of parvovirus and coronavirus each spread with a typical magnitude and each strike at a typical level of seroprevalence. noteworthy, too, is the possibility that parvovirus may consistently infect a higher proportion of susceptibles than does coronavirus, perhaps due to a longer persistence outside the host (weeks for parvovirus vs. hours for coronavirus).we can only provide limited data on the precise cause of mortality in these animals. most lions sim-ply disappear from the study area, and most observed fatalities result from direct combat with other lions or from injuries sustained during prey capture (packer et al. 1988 ). the only clear-cut examples of death due to disease occurred during the cdv outbreak in 1994 (roelke-parker et al. 1996) . in the following section, we rely on a demographic analysis to determine whether any of these viruses is associated with widespread mortality or infertility. these assessments depend on whether the virus is endemic or epidemic.because only two lions tested negative for herpesvirus, we lack a control group with which to compare infected animals. we are therefore unable to measure eects of herpes infection on host ®tness.although virtually every lion was fiv+ by the age of 4 years (fig. 2) , about 20% of 1±2-year-olds were fiv±; thus, we restrict our analysis to the long-term survival of young animals. in domestic cats, fiv infection is permanent and in¯icts most mortality 3±5 years after the initial infection (see fig. 8 . estimated number of`new' susceptibles for each virus each year in the serengeti.`new susceptibles' only include animals that were born subsequent to an outbreak and they only remain susceptible until the next successive outbreak, whereupon further cubs contribute to the next set of new susceptibles. table 1 ). if fiv is similarly harmful to lions, we would expect fiv+ lions to suer a shorter life expectancy than fiv± lions of a comparable age. note, though, that all the fiv± animals presumably contracted the virus by their fourth birthday, and our analysis therefore contrasts the survival of animals infected early in life vs. those that would have been infected at a later age. figure 11 shows the annual age-speci®c mortality of lions according to their fiv status as yearlings (top) or as 2-year-olds (bottom). data are plotted separately for males and females because of their contrasting life histories as subadults (packer et al. 1988 ). fiv did not measurably increase mortality either in the short term (when fiv± animals were presumably still uninfected) or in the long term (overall, seven fiv+ animals survived > 10 years). although these data are too limited to detect subtle eects on mortality, we have seen no clinical signs of immune de®ciency except during the cdv outbreak in 1994. cdv is immunosuppressive, but there was no association between clinical pathology and fiv status of cdv victims (roelke-parker et al. 1996) . further, we found no evidence that co-infection with any of the other viruses in¯uenced longevity of fiv+ individuals (all statistical tests non-signi®cant).the entire adult population was fiv+ , so we cannot assess the eects of viral infection on fecundity. fig. 9 . estimated annual seroprevalence for each virus in the serengeti. all seronegatives are assumed to have been seronegative for their entire lives. seropositives are assumed to have been exposed to the virus at the most recent outbreak, but no assumptions are made about their earlier serostatus. fig. 10 . the`incidence' of each serengeti outbreak plotted as a function of the estimated seroprevalence at the onset of the epidemic. incidence is de®ned in the text. the 1987 calicivirus`outbreak' is plotted in parentheses, since it did not spread beyond a single pride.the sporadic appearance of each epidemic virus enabled us to test whether epidemics coincided with overall reductions in lion mortality or fecundity. for this analysis, we only examine the survival and reproduction of individuals that could have been susceptible to the virus at the onset of each epidemic.outbreaks of each virus occurred at 4±12-year intervals (table 4) . we therefore restricted our analysis to the annual mortality of lions <4 years old, since these cohorts consisted entirely of`susceptibles' at the onset of each outbreak. cub mortality is of particular interest here, since most disease-induced mortality is restricted to kittens in domestic cats (table 1) . survival rates in young lions depended on age and¯uctuated from year to year (fig. 12) , but there was no consistent pattern associated with any particular virus. for example, cub survival was sig-ni®cantly reduced during the calicivirus outbreak of 1980 (w 2 = 19´35, d.f. = 1, p = 0´0000). although cub survival was also below-average in the calicivirus outbreak of 1985, cubs enjoyed higher survival than average during the 1990 calicivirus epidemic. only the 1994 cdv outbreak in¯icted lower survival on every age-group (with signi®cant declines for yearlings (w 2 = 24´09, d.f. = 1, p = 0´0000) and 3year-olds (w 2 = 10´61, d.f. = 1, p = 0´0011). however, neither the 1981 cdv outbreak in the serengeti nor the 1980 outbreak in ngorongoro had any appreciable impact on lion survival, although two serengeti lions developed myoclonus in 1981.without clear signs of illness, we cannot rule out the possibility of a spurious association between a single disease outbreak and a year of low survival. however, the cdv outbreak of 1994 was well-documented and included clearly observed cases of seizures and myoclonus (roelke-parker et al. 1996) . this suggests that the high survival rates during earlier outbreaks of cdv may have been due to nonpathogenic strains of the virus. it was not possible to estimate the extent of the earlier cdv epidemics, but it is at least noteworthy that cdv in 1994 was the most extensive of any documented outbreak and struck the largest population of susceptibles. fig. 11 . age-speci®c mortality rates of (a) females and (b) males according to their fiv status when sampled between the ages of 1±2 years (top) and 2±3 years (bottom). sample sizes of fiv+ animals are given in normal type, of fiv± animals in italics. there was no signi®cant eect of fiv status on the mortality rates of either sex or either age-class or in the combined data set.unfortunately, we have been unable to collect any blood samples from ngorongoro crater since 1991, so we cannot test whether the recent decline in this population (see fig. 7 ) was associated with a viral outbreak. a domestic dog with cdv was found on the crater rim in october of 1994 (cleaveland 1996) , and several of the ngorongoro crater lions were conspicuously ill at about the same time, but none showed neurological symptoms of cdv.we measured`fecundity' as the proportion of females that gave birth during a particular year. because of high adult seroprevalence for all viruses, adult females could only have been`susceptible' to a virus if the interval between outbreaks was suciently long. this analysis is therefore restricted to seven widely-spaced outbreaks in the serengeti and only includes young (and hence susceptible) females. because of age-related changes in fecundity (packer et al. 1998) , as well as medium-term ecological variations , we compare the reproductive performance of 4±13-year-old females over the ®rst 2 years before and/or after each outbreak. as in the mortality analysis, none of the four viruses consistently in¯icted a signi®cant loss in fecundity, although there seems to be a recurring eect of cdv (fig. 13 ). again, it is possible that there were strain dierences, as fecundity was slightly lowered during the 1985 parvovirus and calicivirus out-breaks. the high annual variation around the 1990 calicivirus and 1993 coronavirus epidemics is dicult to interpret and presumably re¯ects other ecological factors (such as annual variations in prey availability, population density, and social disruption; see packer et al. 1988) temporal variation in seroprevalence indicates that both fiv and herpesvirus are endemic in these lion populations. both show consistently high prevalence (figs 1 and 2) and both appear to be relatively harmless, although it is dicult to compare the ®tness of infected and uninfected hosts. in domestic cats, fiv follows a similar aetiology as hiv in humans (pedersen et al. 1987; yamamoto et al. 1988; torten et al. 1991 ) and, like hiv in humans, fiv appears to have infected domestic cats only recently (rigby et al. 1993; carpenter & o'brien 1995) . we could ®nd no evidence that fiv status in¯uenced lion mortality (fig. 11) , nor did we observe any obvious signs of immunode®ciency or clinical pathology in fiv+ individuals (but see poli et al. 1995) . phylogenetic analysis of fiv sequences in our study animals suggests that lions have been hosts to the virus for long periods of time (brown et al. 1994) , and an attenuated eect from fiv infection may have arisen through a variety of co-evolutionary mechanisms (reviewed by carpenter & o'brien 1995) . alternatively, studies of domestic cats suggest that fiv may be more pathogenic in individuals that are co-infected with felv (courchamp et al. 1997) . thus, the low impact of fiv in these lions may be because they are not co-infected with felv.the remaining four viruses showed high temporal variation in seroprevalence, indicative of epidemic outbreaks of disease (figs 3 and 4) . these outbreaks typically occurred after a large number of susceptibles were recruited into the population (fig. 8) , and the extent of each outbreak apparently depended on the size of the susceptible host population (figs 9  and 10 ). previous studies have documented the existence of threshold host densities for the establishment of pathogens in natural populations (jaee et al. 1992; dobson & hudson 1995; dobson & meagher 1996) . in the lions, calicivirus, parvovirus, and to some extent coronavirus showed evidence that viral invasion required a threshold density of susceptible hosts (fig. 8) . minimum estimates of susceptible host density varied among the viruses, and ranged from 75 to 200 animals in the serengeti study area (which includes about 10% of the overall serengeti lion population).viruses that were associated with higher initial rates of spread (as estimated by our measure of incidence') also required the highest threshold densities of seronegative hosts. for example, calicivirus and coronavirus outbreaks occurred when susceptible host densities were relatively low and were associated with smaller increases in seroprevalence. in contrast, parvovirus required a larger number of susceptibles and infected a larger proportion of susceptibles during outbreaks. cdv is both the exception and the rule for this pattern. cdv infected numerous carnivore species in the late 1970s, as well as in 1994 (reviewed in roelke-parker et al. 1996; cleaveland 1996) , so the`susceptible population' of only 75 lions in 1981 and over 200 lions in 1994 actually included uncounted numbers of susceptible canids, hyenas and other large felids. however, the lion population was not only large, but also 100% susceptible during the 1994 cdv epidemic, and over 85% of the lions were infected within a few months.none of the epidemic viruses consistently lowered host ®tness. the 1994 cdv outbreak was conspicuously harmful (as emphasized by the sharp decline fig. 13 . annual female fecundity before, during and after associated epidemics. numbers indicate sample sizes and arrows indicate the years in which the epidemics occurred. for years prior to each outbreak, data only include adult females that had not yet been exposed to the virus. in the year of an outbreak, the data only include adult females who were exposed to the virus for the ®rst time that year. for the following years, data include all adult females who had been exposed for the ®rst time during that outbreak (including females who had been exposed as subadults). analysis only includes data-points based on at least ®ve females. annual fecundity varied signi®cantly in the years around the 1993 coronavirus outbreak (w 2 = 14´37, d.f. = 3, p = 0´0062) and the 1990 calicivirus outbreak (w 2 = 8´89, d.f. = 3, p = 0´0308).in the serengeti population, see fig. 7 ), and the 1980 calicivirus epidemic may have in¯icted considerable cub mortality, but other outbreaks of these same viruses appeared to be essentially harmless. indeed, none of these viruses regularly in¯icted the same degree of mortality observed in domestic cats (table 1) . sequence data are only available for the 1994 cdv strain (roelke-parker et al. 1996) , so we cannot make similar assessments of co-evolutionary history as for fiv, nor can we comment on genetic dierences between strains of the same virus. however, strain dierences in pathogenicity have been well documented in other morbiliviruses besides cdv (e.g. rinderpest, plowright 1982) . it is also possible that all of these viruses were harmful to some extent, but our demographic analysis was too coarse-grained to detect their eects. the timing of each outbreak was estimated retrospectively, we could not control for confounding interactions with other ecological variables, and the lions were no doubt co-infected with additional pathogens and parasites. no ®eld analysis could ever provide the sort of comparisons that would be available from controlled experiments (dobson & mccallum 1995) . dobson & mccallum (1995) and jaenike (1998) have shown that host populations can be limited by pathogens that in¯ict moderate eects on host mortality and moderate to large eects on fertility. out of all the viruses included in this study, only cdv appears to be suciently virulent to cause measurable declines in the serengeti/ngorongoro lion populations. cdv caused considerable mortality in 1994 and may have lowered host fertility during the 1981 and 1994 outbreaks. however, cdv entered the lion population in discrete, widely-spaced epidemics, and these epidemics have been suciently infrequent to in¯ict lasting consequences. the serengeti population recovered rapidly from the 1994 epidemic, regaining its former size by the middle of 1997 (fig. 7) . domestic dogs are the primary reservoir for cdv in the serengeti/ngorongoro region (cleaveland 1996) , and the dog population has grown dramatically with the growing human population over the past 30 years, raising the prospects of more frequent, extensive, and virulent cdv epidemics in the lions and other wild carnivores. attempts to inoculate this reservoir against cdv are currently underway (kaare & cleaveland 1997) .the recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has caused unprecedented morbidity and mortality in almost all the continents (1) . despite implementations of extensive control measures, spread of the disease and eventual fatality could not be effectively halted till date. the major cause of death in covid-19 is due to virus-induced pneumonia leading to respiratory failure (2) . epidemiological evidence suggests that older age and the associated co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes put patients at higher risk of mortality (3) . thus identification of novel risk factors predictive for patients' outcome including mortality is needed.here using the publicly available clinical data from kaggle, we have employed a machine learning tool to identify the risk factors that could potentially contribute to the mortality of covid-19 patients from 22 countries in 4 continents. we show that older age and delayed hospitalisation of symptomatic patients are the two major risk factors for mortality in covid-19 patients.the dataset was downloaded from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novelcorona-virus-2019-dataset#covid19_line_list_data.csv) on 23 rd march, 2020. it contained a total of 1085 reported cases of covid-19 from 13 th january to 28 th february, 2020. missing values were removed for all the variables to obtain a dataset of 433 individuals. 3 cases were filtered out from the dataset as the date of hospital visit preceded the date of symptom onset for them. among the 430 cases selected finally from 22 countries in asia, australia, europe and all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified

statistics of the deaths and confirmed recovered cases have been depicted in table 1 .random forest classification algorithm (4) was implemented over a dataset with 37 deaths and 78 recoveries using the randomforest package in r. the dataset was randomly split into training and test dataset containing 70% and 30% of the total samples respectively. to evaluate the model performance, the area under the roc curve was calculated on the test dataset. a variable importance plot was generated using the importance of the predictors over the outcome. the importance of the variables has been reported according to both the mean decrease of gini and the mean decrease of accuracy. the partial dependency plots were finally generated using the pdp package in r to determine the marginal effect of the age and time to hospitalization over the fate of covid-19 infection.the descriptive summary of the data has been represented by mean and standard deviation (sd). the numerical variables have been compared between groups by independentsamples two-sided student's t-test. the categorical variables have been tested using chi-square test. all the statistical analyses were performed in rstudio

important variable in the model for predicting the fate which was interestingly followed by the time gap between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization. the importance of the variables in terms of mean decrease in accuracy and mean decrease in gini are graphically shown in figure 2 (a, b) .in order to inspect the marginal effect of the predictors over the mortality of patients with covid-19, we generated the partial dependency plots for the odds of death among covid-19 patients with age and days from the onset of symptoms to hospitalisation. as shown in figure 2 (c, d), accentuation in odds of death was found with age beyond 62 years as well as beyond a time gap of 2 days between the onset of symptoms to hospitalisation. taken together, our analysis identifies older age (62 years) and delayed hospitalisation as the two most important predictors of mortality among patients with covid-19.mortality of critically ill patients of covid-19 is high and co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease are often present in hospitalised patients.though 48% of the non-survivors had a co-morbid disease, in multivariate analyses, independent associations of in-hospital death were found to be present with older age, high sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score and elevated d-dimer levels (6) . another study has also identified older patients as a high risk group for mortality (7) . in agreement with previously published studies, our analysis also identified age to be the most important risk factor for mortality among covid-19 patients. however, the role of delayed hospitalisation following the development of symptoms as another significant risk factor for mortality among covid-19 patients (after age) is being reported for the first time. the inadequacy of healthcare resources has already been reported to associate with increased mortality among covid-19 patients (8) .all rights reserved. no reuse allowed

(sars-cov-2), first reported in wuhan, china, that contributed to an increased morbidity and mortality, was declared to be a major worldwide pandemic by the world health organization (who) [1] . since then, recent advances in understanding the pathological progression and transmission of coronavirus disease have contributed to efforts toward the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. although, coronaviruses (covs) were initially contemplated to be a cause of multifaceted diseases in mammals and birds with its origin in bats [2] , the evolution of this virus has resulted in its increased pathogenicity in humans. covs, in general, were deemed important in veterinary responses; however, since the outbreak of human coronavirus (hcov) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars-cov) in 2003, middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) in 2012, and the recent outbreak of sars-cov-2, it has been labeled as an "emerging pathogen" in humans.given their high pathogenicity in humans and the extent of global impact caused by the hcov outbreaks in the past two decades, it has been a topic of great interest; hence, the mechanistic action of this virus is being thoroughly investigated by researchers. the causative agent of the current pandemic presenting as a viral pneumonia, sars-cov-2 is a group of large, enveloped rna viruses under the coronaviridae family, classified specifically under the nidovirales order [3] . the cumulative line of evidence demonstrates that sars-cov-2 shares 79.6% of sequence identity to the sars-cov outbreak in 2003, at a genomic level, while the genomic sequence is almost 96% identical to the bat coronavirus [4] , which provides a significant insight to understanding covid-19 and its origin. while understanding the origin and the evolution of sars-cov-2 is imminent, the clinical manifestation of this virus in humans and the increasing number of symptomatic and asymptomatic "carriers" every day, presents growing concern for public health.the aggressive growth in numbers of emerging cases suggests the rapid spread of the virus in naïve population and improvement in diagnostic capability during this covid-19 outbreak, however, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas [5] [6] [7] . the differences in the urban and rural areas can highly determine the influence of a viral pandemic, in terms of viral transmission, diagnostics, morbidity, and mortality [5] . these differences mainly arise from the socioeconomic factors, access to healthcare, and pandemic preparedness. given the higher percentage of u.s. rural population being old (age ≥ 60), individuals with obesity (body mass index (bmi) ≥ 30) and associated co-morbidities along with their smoking status; these factors puts them at higher risk of infection and severe complications arising from covid-19. hence, this review aims to provide an insight on the modality and transmission dynamics of the sars-cov-2 clinical characteristics persistent with the virus and further discuss efforts toward the development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to combat its progression in humans. this review also aims to assess the challenges of the covid-19 pandemic in rural settings based on the past pandemic experiences and the overall effect on rural population.the methodology of this study followed the principles of literature review. the study was conducted based on literature identification and collection, literature analysis, and literature categorization.the databases of this research included academic search premier, pubmed, proquest, science direct, and google scholar. an extensive search was performed from various governmental websites including the world health organization (who) and centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). the keywords used for the search included the following: "coronavirus" or "pandemic" or "pathogenesis" or "sars-cov-2" and "covid-19" or "human transmission" or "pharmacological" and "nonpharmacological" or "clinical characteristics" and "the u.s." and "rural healthcare". the articles were retrieved from our search and further distinguished for relevancy.the research articles chosen were reviewed for government guidelines, mitigation strategies, persisting symptoms, covid-19 morbidity and mortality, and u.s. rural healthcare. the inclusion and exclusion criteria were set to only evaluate articles and data published from 2003 to 2020 in order to limit this search. furthermore, this search was restricted to all the articles available as full text and published in the english language. any relevancy or information deemed important was also included from articles published outside u.s. a total of 181 articles was assessed by three reviewers for relevancy, out of which 96 references and citations were utilized.the articles were reviewed based on their abstracts to find out the relevancy to this study. conclusively, the findings were presented under the subheadings of: pathogenesis of covid-19, transmission dynamics of covid-19, clinical characteristics persistent with covid-19, pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention, and, finally, challenges in rural population.covs normally cause enteric diseases in several animal species and affect the respiratory tract of mammals, including humans, and lead to mild-to-severe respiratory tract infections [8] . studies report five major protein regions for hcovs, such as replicase complex, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins, that function in viral structure assembly and replications [9] . the overlapping open reading frames (orfs) of replicase complex, orf1a and orf1b, encode 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) of viral rna synthesis complex through proteolytic processing [10] . the nsp12 is a viral rna-dependent rna polymerase, together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity. a recent study showed 94.4% similarity in the amino acid sequences of the seven conserved replicase domains in orf1ab of sars-cov and sars-cov-2 [4] . the spike (s) is a transmembrane glycoprotein, that comprises two domains: s1 and s2, which play a pivotal role in mediating viral infection through binding the host receptor [11, 12] . the interaction between the s1 domain and its cognate receptor triggers a conformational change in the s protein, which then promotes membrane fusion between the viral and cell membrane through the s2 domain [13] . the three short insertions in the n-terminal domain as well as changes in four out of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif compared with the sequence of sars-cov are the key differences recently found by scientists in the s gene of sars-cov-2 [4] . the major host cell receptors utilized by all hcovs are aminopeptidase n by hcov-229e [14] , angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) by sars-cov [15] and hcov-nl63 [16, 17] , dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) by mers-cov [18] , and 9-o-acetylated sialic acid by hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 [19, 20] .a recent study showed that covid-19 is able to utilize the same membrane-bound ace2 as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells with higher affinity than sars-cov and does not use other coronavirus receptors [4, 21] . ace2 is highly expressed in the mouth and tongue, facilitating viral entry in the host, and in lungs it is expressed in lower lungs on type i and ii alveolar epithelial cells. after infection, sars-cov-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ace2 on the alveolar surface. the binding of sars-cov-2 to ace2 stimulates the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the whole sars-cov-2 and ace2 complex, inducing fusion at the cell membrane [22] . the membrane fusion and endosomal cell entry is facilitated by the low ph in the cellular environment and ph-dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins [8] . once inside the cells, sars-cov-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate itself and spreads through the entire lung [8] . the nucleocapsid helps for packaging the viral genome through protein oligomerization. as the infection progresses, it deleteriously affects the normal activity of most of the ciliated cells in the alveoli that clear the airways, with a consequent progressive accumulation of debris and fluids in the lungs and eventually leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). in addition to the alveolar cells in the lungs, ace2 expression has been reported in other organs, including the kidney, the heart, and the gut [23] , which supports the commonly reported co-morbidities of covid-19, such as acute kidney injury (aki), cardiac damage, and abdominal pain.as the first cases of the covid-19 were linked to direct exposure to the huanan seafood wholesale market of wuhan, china, animal-to-human transmission was initially presumed [24, 25] . however, subsequent cases revealed the scope of human-to-human transmission through the individuals in the incubation stage or showing symptoms. through the widespread information available and recent increase in understanding of the sars-cov-2, the virus appears to have an incubation time ranging from 2 to 14 days [26] [27] [28] [29] . a recent report suggested that the symptomatic patients had higher viral loads, detected in the nose and throat, following the onset of their symptoms [30] . these viral loads peaked around 5-6 days following the symptoms onset [31] . consequently, the asymptomatic patients had a viral load similar to symptomatic patients [30] . hence, such human-to-human transmission through symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers caused the epidemic to gradually grow over weeks, eventually becoming a global pandemic. the human-to-human transmission is mainly through the inhalation of respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing and through contact of infected surfaces, then mediating the infection through the mouth, nose, or eyes [32] . transmission via the inhalation of exhaled respiratory droplets may occur as aerosol droplets that can survive for prolonged periods, mediating long-range human-to-human transmission via air movement. inhalation of virus-laden fine particles could transport the virus into deeper alveolar and tracheobronchial regions, which could increase the chance of infective transmission and oxidant pollutants in air can impair the immune function and attenuate the efficiency of the lung to clear the virus in the lungs. pro-inflammation, injury, and fibrosis from inhaled airborne particulate matters combined with an immune response or cytokine storm induced by sars-cov-2 infection could enhance the infection severity [32] . since human-to-human transmission is the primary mode of transmission of the virus, the international public health response toward mitigating covid-19 has largely been based on social/physical distancing, isolation of cases, and quarantine measures [25] .further studies have also shown that infectious viruses, including covs, can survive for long periods outside of the host organism, increasing the opportunity for transmission via touch [33] . it has been reported that sars-cov-2 can last about three days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces, about one day on cardboard surfaces, and about four hours on copper surfaces [34, 35] . despite these evidences, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads (cdc). apart from that, covs were previously reported to remain infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks [36] , which adds another potential transmission route if the quality of personal hygiene is poor. however, the mode of transmission for covid-19 through contaminated water does not have enough scientific evidence, hence, requires further studies to validate it.among the earlier studies, covid-19 was reported to have a mean serial interval of 7.5 days, which is defined as the delay between disease onset dates in successive cases in chains of transmission [37] . using the data from the serial interval distribution, the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 [37] . the identification of these characteristics is important as the study extensively inferred the doubling of covid-19 every seven days since each patient transmitted the infection to an additional 2.2 individuals. similarly, other modeling studies estimated the basic case reproduction rate ranging from 2 to 6.47, while who published their early estimation to be ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 [38] [39] [40] [41] .covid-19 may present with a range of symptoms in humans, varying from mild cold-like symptoms to severe life-threatening respiratory tract infections. the infection begins with the gradual onset of symptoms following an incubation period of 2-14 days after exposure [26] [27] [28] [29] 42] . on the basis of disease severity, clinical manifestations can be categorized as mild (81%), severe (14%), and critical (5%), as noted in the covid-19 positive patients [41] . the initial infectious stage is characterized by mild constitutional symptoms and upper respiratory tract infection [41] . the most frequently experienced symptoms include fever, dry cough, sore throat, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, and headache [42] . this is followed by other vague symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, malaise, muscle pain, drowsiness, and myalgia [29, 41, [43] [44] [45] . with the number of cases increasing worldwide, other symptoms have also been reported, which are ever evolving and differ depending on the population studies. however, the question whether these symptoms are directly correlated with covid-19 manifestation, remains elusive and requires further scientific and clinical evidence.following an antecedent of 5-9 days of primary viral manifestations, these initially mild symptoms manifest as a progressively advanced disease accompanied by pneumonia and ards, which is the most ominous feature of this infection [29, 41, 43, 46] . other secondary manifestations, which could be present, are rnaemia as a continuum of ards, chronic dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction [41, 42, 47, 48] . moreover, in critical cases, the virus can also trigger severe complications such as sepsis and septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction, and acute cardiac and renal injury [29, [41] [42] [43] . these complications are also linked with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [29, 49] and hematological changes including leukopenia (33.7%), lymphopenia (83.2%), and thrombocytopenia (36.2%) [49] . critical cases with secondary infections may also present co-infections of bacteria and fungi [43] .in addition to these overt symptoms, there has been a growing concern for asymptomatic cases [50] . these immunocompetent viral carriers present asymptomatic infections, not manifesting any symptoms, which unanimously pose an imminent danger and may have grave outcomes. recent studies have signified the emergence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections as a potential portal of viral transmission that needs vigilant control to detect and mitigate these community-acquired infections [37, 46, 51, 52] . individuals with viral tolerance present a potential challenge in the annihilation of this infection, especially in rural america, with inadequate health care infrastructure and high rates of chronic clinical issues [53] . consistent with recent studies, the majority of critically ill covid-19 patients are known to have some underlying chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease [29, 41, 42, 45] . these clinical conditions are also a significant health issue in the rural population; therefore, such patients are more vulnerable to developing severe covid-19 symptoms [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] .as there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccine recommended specifically for sars-cov-2 infection for potential therapy of humans till date, scientists are endeavoring to find drugs to treat this disease. currently, the treatment is symptomatic and oxygen therapy is considered as the major treatment intervention for patients with severe infection [41] . pharmacological interventions that can prevent a mild state from progressing to the severe or critical state will significantly improve the overall prognosis of the disease. in order to reduce disease worsening and the mortality rate, developing an effective approach to modulate the immune system or suppress reactive cytokine production is of crucial importance. studies are currently testing the efficacy of existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs in inhibiting sars-cov-2 replication. the major drugs that exhibited promising inhibitory effects are remdesivir and chloroquine. remdesivir is an adenosine analogue that cause premature termination of viral replication and has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of rna virus (including sars/mers-cov5) infections in various experimental models [60, 61] . reports show that remdesivir can inhibit covid-19 infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to covid-19 [39] . recent studies have also reported that remdesivir yielded promising results in the treatment of a patient with covid-19 in the u.s. [46] , and further studies are currently under progress to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug. chloroquine is an antimalarial drug, known to exert a potent antiviral effect by virtue of its ability to increase the endosomal ph required for virus/cell fusion and interfere with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of sars-cov [62] . a study demonstrated that chloroquine could function at both, entry and at post-entry stages of the covid-19 infection in vero e6 cells and has an immune-modulating activity, which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo [39] . hydroxychloroquine is an antirheumatic drug with a similar chemical structure to chloroquine and exhibits a strong immunomodulatory capacity, which prevents inflammation flare-ups and organ damage [63] . it can also increase the intracellular ph, interrupt toll-like receptor (tlr) signaling and subsequent attenuation of proinflammatory signaling activation and production of cytokines, such as type i interferons, interleukin-1 (il-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) [64] . as severe covid-19 can be due to the overactivation of the immune system triggered by covid-19 infection, hydroxychloroquine can be suggested to attenuate the progression of the disease from mild to severe. ifn-α is a broad-spectrum antiviral used to treat hepatitis and is reported to inhibit sars-cov reproduction in vitro [65] . lopinavir/ritonavir, a medication used to treat the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), is also found to exhibit anti-sars-cov activity in vitro and in clinical studies [66] . ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue with a broad-spectrum of antiviral effects, exhibited lower risk of ards and death when used in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir [65] . favipiravir is a new type of rna-dependent rna polymerase inhibitor reported to possess anti-influenza virus activity and is capable of blocking the replication of flavi-, alpha-, filo-, bunya-, arena-, noro-, and other rna viruses [67] . so clinical trials of favipiravir on covid-19 infection have now been initiated by the clinical medical research center of the national infectious diseases and the third people's hospital of shenzhen. other potential drugs include type ii transmembrane serine protease (tmspss2) inhibitors and bcr-abl kinase inhibitor imatinib. the ability of these drugs to block the entry and inhibit the fusion of virions with the endosomal membrane may provide anti-coronal activity [68, 69] .as discussed earlier in the light of recently published reports, 2019-ncov can utilize ace2 as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells with higher affinity than sars-cov, suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development [4] . ace2 also plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin system (ras), and the imbalance between ace/ang ii/at1r pathway and ace2/ang (1-7)/mas receptor pathway in the ras will lead to multisystem inflammation, and studies have shown that ras inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure [70] . one of our previously published articles highlights the possible interactions between a cytochrome p450 (cyp)-derived arachidonic acid metabolite, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-hete), and ras [71] . the findings showed that 20-hete-induced hypertension in cyp4a2-transduced rats is associated with ras upregulation and can be abrogated by ace inhibition or angiotensin type 1 receptor (at1r) blockade. the study evaluates the effect of lisinopril, losartan, 20-hede (20-hete antagonist 20-hydroxyeicosa-6(z), 15(z)-dienoic acid), and het0016, an inhibitor of 20-hete, in modulating ras, ace, and various downstream signaling molecules involved in the pathway. hence, our findings will also provide some valuable lead for the ongoing and future investigations on therapeutic interventions against covid-19. as the pandemic continues to affect increasing an number of people, scientists around the world are actively exploring the efficacy and safety of the drugs in the treatment of covid-19 and the findings need to be validated in further preclinical and clinical trials.non-pharmaceutical public health measures are vital in curtailing disease spread [41, 45, 72] . to constrain local transmission and to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, the who has recommended non-pharmacological interventions that are specifically geared to limit the spread of the infection from person to person and reduce the number of mortalities [41] . strategies to mitigate the transmission entail personal and community-based actions [29] . non-pharmacological interventions are perhaps some of the most effective ways to prevent widespread mortality of the disease by slowing the rate of infection to a manageable level that healthcare systems can withhold.personal interventions include, frequent hand washing after every 15-20 min [29] , use of hand sanitizers with ≥60% alcohol content, wearing face masks, encouraging people to cover their mouth and nose during coughing and sneezing, keeping a distance from sick people, avoiding contact with face and mouth with unwashed hands [41, 45] , and self-quarantine when a person feels unwell [41] . whereas, community-based mitigation strategies include, social distancing, avoiding crowded areas, and restriction on public gathering and non-essential traveling [29, 41] .in addition to these measures, studies have shown the supportive effects of herbal or nutritional interventions, including immune-boosting nutrients and herbs that can help overcome upper respiratory tract viral infections [73] . complementary therapies that can boost the immune response at the initial stage of covid-19 infection might be a prudent approach to overcome the symptoms associated with this infection [74] . there has also been evidence that traditional or herbal medicine has helped improve the condition of patients with covid-19 or those who presented with symptoms. a study in the chinese population following traditional chinese medicine found that patients who were treated with qingfei paidu decoction (qpd), a herbal chinese traditional medicine (a combination of 4 different herbal formulas consisting of 21 herbs in total), were found to have an effective cure rate of over 90% against 701 confirmed cases of covid-19 [75, 76] . in light of this evidence, the chinese government promoted this herbal treatment to be used in the diagnosis and treatment of patients who have or are suspected to have covid-19. qpd was also recommended by the korean government's guidelines for severe cases of covid-19 [76] . combined remedies of both herbal medicine and western medicine were also found to be more effective than using western medicine alone in treating patients with covid-19 [77] .furthermore, in response to the current pandemic, who recently supported the use of scientifically proven traditional medicines. the recognition by who toward traditional, herbal, and complementary medicine, included the use of the medicinal plant artemisia annua against coronavirus, which is being used by african countries. the use of artemisia annua was also boosted by madagascar in the form of an herbal drink, widely known as "covid-organics". although there is ample evidence present for the positive effects of this medicinal plant [78] [79] [80] [81] , who advised testing the efficacy and adverse side effects of this plant through rigorous clinical trials, before prescribing it to covid-19 affected patients. therefore, non-pharmacological interventions suggested by who and used by other countries possess potential defense against the spread of this infection, even when drugs and vaccines will be available. these measures can provide protection to the individuals exposed to the virus, by limiting the symptomatic complications arising from covid-19, eventually reducing the overall mortality rate. future studies are recommended to provide valid and reliable containment measures to control the local transmission of this infection.the worldwide escalation and clinical manifestation of covid-19, despite constant efforts from the healthcare workers and respective governments to minimize its impact, may still be underdiagnosed. studies have demonstrated that the risk of mortality from covid-19 is significantly higher in the aging population, including patients with pre-existing comorbidities. reflecting on earlier data, 80% of the mortality related to covid-19 was noted among adults aged ≥60 years [82] . these observations raise serious public health concerns, considering that 19.3% of the u.s. population resides in rural areas with the average age of rural americans being 73.3 years [83] (u.s. consensus). there is also a high rate of obesity in rural populations [54] . this is important as there are indications that a possible reason for a higher mortality rate for covid-19 in italy compared to china could be the fact that there is a higher percentage of obesity in older adults in italy, noting a similar pattern that occurred with the h1n1 pandemic [84] . besides this, rural areas tend to have a higher percentage of smoking within the population [85] . covid-19 being a respiratory illness, individuals with a smoking history have higher chances of being affected by the virus and having a severe case that requires ventilation is compounded. while several strategies have been adopted to prevent the spread in urban populations, preventing the transmission dynamics and the spread of covid-19 in rural regions have received limited attention. although rural regions have limited human mobility and relatively lower population densities than urban settings [86] , the extent of morbidity and mortality might be significantly higher in the viral-inflicted rural population, making the containment and mitigation of viral transmission unmanageable.apart from the potential significant impact of covid-19 on the aging population in rural america, the rural healthcare delivery system remains relatively under-resourced. rural areas across the world have been greatly impacted by pandemics in the past, and it is clear with covid-19 that there are on-going issues related to the infrastructure in these communities that have not been addressed. previous pandemics such as the h1n1, influenza a caused high mortality rates in rural turkey, and these deaths were directly linked to lack of advanced intensive care unit (icu) facilities with preliminary ventilator support [87] . this could easily contribute to the existing problem among other issues such as late diagnosis and late antiviral therapy. the limited availability of icu facilities is still an issue in rural areas, particularly in the united states. although there has been a trend of an increasing number of icu beds being added to hospitals, these icu beds have been found to be concentrated in large, urban hospitals while small-to-medium hospitals had decreased icu capacity [88] . as noted previously, severe cases of covid-19 can require ventilation, which is primarily available in icus. with rural populations having less access to these resources, the mortality rate can rise. besides a lack of icu availability, the healthcare in rural america has noted a significant disparity in terms of the distribution of professional resources, such as lack of healthcare workers, major healthcare institutions, and overwhelming financial burden, as compared to urban settings [89] . limited physicians, healthcare training opportunities, delayed care, disparities in patient demographics (older population), and substandard quality of healthcare are already reflected in overall health outcomes as the mortality is higher in rural populations [90] . these observations suggest lack of pandemic preparedness in rural america; hence, the global spread of covid-19 may significantly impact rural communities to a greater extent.the effectiveness of covid-19 pandemic mitigation primarily requires a high level of participation from each individual, such as having adequate knowledge of the viral transmission, engaging in appropriate self-care, following self-hygiene guidelines and social distancing, which are fundamental in avoiding preventable hospitalizations [29] . however, due to lower socioeconomic resources in a rural setting, there is limited literacy, specially health literacy, among the rural population, which may exacerbate the impact of covid-19 in rural areas [91] . the cumulative line of evidence have demonstrated that poor adult literacy is strongly correlated with reduced health knowledge and self-management skills, reduced physical and mental health, higher rates of hospitalizations and increased morbidity and mortality [92] [93] [94] . hence, the consequences of covid-19 pandemic for the rural population will depend partly on the health risk communication and viral awareness. pandemic communication gaps may increase vulnerability among rural populations, which may trigger disease misconceptions, uninformed policies, insufficient planning, and fostering non-resilience, predisposing the population to communicable viral risks [95] .one way to potentially fix this gap could be by using and ensuring that the local news media (i.e., local news channels, local newspapers) have accurate, current, and practical advice for their viewers. rural areas rely heavily on media specifically, local media, for their information. yet a study on a rural area in california found that in general, many local news sources did not include important information about health issues that were affecting the area [96] . while dealing with covid-19, it is imperative we use these key news sources to reach areas that traditional media will not. if accurate data and advice can be presented in these sources, it can be an indispensable asset in preventing the reach of inaccurate misconceptions and increase participation in community-based mitigation strategies.the viral outbreak of covid-19, declared as a global pandemic, continues to overwhelm the healthcare system with increasing number of patients presenting with clinical symptoms of this coronavirus. this increasing rate of incidence of this contagion presents with its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions, global economy, impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide. although several strategies have been adopted to mitigate the effects of this viral outbreak, the rural population has been largely ignored, despite the high risks of morbidity and mortality among this population. this review aims to provide a clinical insight into the outbreak of covid-19, outlining the pathogenesis, transmission dynamics, and clinical characteristics of the patients tested positive for this virus (figure 1 ). although the development of a sars-cov-2-specific vaccines is still under clinical trials, this review discusses pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that are widely being used by healthcare professionals to manage the symptoms and combat the impact of the virus on patients. finally, this review provides an outline of the challenges and implications of covid-19 in a rural population, given that a large percentage of the population in a rural setting are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities, individuals with obesity, and individuals having a smoking history, who are at higher risk of mortality. considering the age stratification, pre-existing co-morbidities such as obesity, smoking status along with limited healthcare access, resources, and health literacy, the rural population might be at a significant risk. because of the dynamic nature of the pandemic, a conceptual framework is required for current and post-pandemic stages of covid-19, inclusive of strategies to mitigate the risks of this contagion in the rural population. coronavirus. this increasing rate of incidence of this contagion presents with its own challenges, burdening healthcare

353,334 people worldwide as of may 28, 2020, according to the world health organization (who) [1] . in the last 3 -4 months, there has been an overflow of scientific and non-scientific information on sars-cov-2 and covid-19. the relationship between age and covid-19-associated morbidity or mortality has also been addressed among health professionals and the general population. the surge of infected patients beyond the limits of medical systems has raised social concerns on whether age should be considered in determining treatment intensity [2] . the perception that young people's morbid condition is relatively less severe also lowered their awareness of preventing infection in some regions.one of the most critical issues dealt by clinical and public health professionals during the pandemic is the spectrum of illness severity. this affects the triage, diagnostic and therapeutic decision making, and prognostic expectations; therefore, understanding covid-19-associated morbidity and mortality according to age is important. however, the data published in each country are inconsistent because of multiple reasons such as different populations, extent of available laboratory tests, and medical systems. hence, we reviewed covid-19 epidemiology data published from several countries to identify any consistent trends in the relationship between age and covid-19-associated morbidity or mortality. we also reviewed the literature for studies explaining the difference in the host response to sars-cov-2 infection according to age.covid-19 fatality rates vary significantly depending on the country; it was 0.06% in qatar and 16.25% in belgium as of may 26, 2020 [3] . this variation in fatality rates may be due to differences in healthcare adequacy and/or epidemiological characteristics of patients; the frequency of diagnostic screening in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients may also influence the rate [4] . however, there is a consistent and clear pattern of an age-based exponential increase in fatality rate, regardless of the geographic region. according to the korea centers for disease control and prevention, the overall case fatality rate (cfr) was 2.37% in 11,344 patients with confirmed cases on may 28, 2020, but it was much higher in the elderly (10.9% in patients aged 70 -79 years and 26.6% in patients ≥80 years) [5] . in another analysis of 44,672 cases in china diagnosed as of february 11, 2020, the overall cfr was 2.3%. however, the cfr was 8.0% in patients aged 70 -79 years and 14.8% in patients aged ≥80 years [6] . in the report released by the higher institute of health of italy, the overall cfr on march 26, 2020, was 9.2%, which was four times higher than that in korea or china; however, the pattern of increasing fatality with age was similar to that in korea and china. the cfr was <1% in the age group of <50 years and rapidly increased in the age group of ≥60 years, reaching 16.9% and 24.4% in the age group of 70 -79 years and ≥80 years, respectively ( fig. 1a) [7] . in terms of death per 100,000 individuals in the population (as of may 11, 2020, data from the new york city department of health and mental hygiene, and as of may 8, 2020, data from the office for national statistics of united kingdom), clear patterns of agebased exponential increase in fatality has been observed ( fig. 1b) [8, 9] .influenza, the most commonly reported pandemic disease in human history, had a w-shaped mortality distribution during the pandemic (fig. 1c) [10, 11] . this atypical pattern of mortality with an elevated relative or absolute risk of death in middle-age groups is usually explained by differences in age-related susceptibility to infection, affected by pre-existing age-related immunity [11] . as sars-cov-2 is a novel virus introduced to human, this type of mortality distribution is unlikely to be expected. however, the age-related pattern of covid-19 fatality differs from that of other respiratory viral infections, wherein the severity pattern is often described as a u-shaped curve, with morbidity and mortality concentrated at extreme age groups (younger children and the elderly). population-based studies of seasonal influenza have typically shown this type of mortality distribution according to age (fig. 1c ) [12] . several cohort studies have shown that the hospitalization rate of influenza was highest for the age group of 0 -4 years compared to that in other age groups, which indicates that children under the age of 5 years could be more vulnerable to influenza and/or more severely affected [13, 14] . as the hospitalization fatality rate was relatively low for the age group of 0 -4 years [13, 14] , the mortality curve based on 100,000 individuals showed a much smaller peak in this age group than in the elderly age group. however, this type of mortality peak has not been observed thus far in children affected with covid-19, which suggests that children could be less susceptible to the infection or experience less severe symptoms and have a low cfr.the dynamics of age-specific mortality for covid-19 is relatively familiar because they mirror other major causes of mortality, especially chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease ( fig. 1d ) [15] . promislow et al. have shown that the mortality rate doubling time (mrdt) of all-cause mortality (9 years) in the united states was approximately the same as that of covid-19 reported in the new york city [16] . in other words, the increasing case fatality or mortality rate with age is not a specific finding for covid-19. however, many scientists and media have paid considerable attention to age as a risk factor for mortality in covid-19. this might be due to the surge of infected patients within a short period; hence, the death pattern -high mortality in older people -became more apparent.investigating the susceptibility to infection, unlike mortality or case fatality, in the general population is more complicated because mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients may not have been tested and there is an uneven chance of being exposed to the source of infection depending on the groups (closure of child care facilities, preschools, and schools vs. non-closure of long-term care facilities). the case rate of covid-19 by age has been reported to have wide regional variability. according to new york city data (as of may 11, 2020), the cfr of covid-19 in the general population (cases per 100,000) seemed to increase with age ( fig. 2a) [8]. contrarily, in korea (as of may 10, 2020), where diagnostic tests were performed intensely in groups associated with certain religious gatherings, regardless of any symptoms, the cfr seemed to be highest in the 20 -29-years age group (fig. 2b) et al. have compared the relative illness ratio (rir) by age between different countries (fig. 3 ) [17] . in their study, as of mar 30, 2020, the rir in spain and italy increased with age, while in china and korea [18] , middle or younger age groups seemed to have a higher rir. this could be explained by more extensive testing performed in china and korea than in other countries, which would help to better measure the morbidity among young age groups. in italy and new york city, where there was a surge in the number of covid-19 patients in a short period, it is likely that the viral test was performed first in individuals with more apparent or severe symptoms, while asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients were not tested. overall, these findings suggest that susceptibility to symptomatic infection seems to increase with age, but susceptibility to infection is probably similar among different age groups. . relative illness ratio by 5-year age groups. relative illness ratio (rir) is a measure of morbidity calculated according to the following formula as the share of covid-19 cases in each age group with regard to the total number of morbidity cases divided by the share of the population in the same age group. riri = (ccovidi/∑iccovidi)(pi∑ipi), where covid is the estimated number of cases of covid-19 in age group ἰ, and p is the population in the same age group. a value above 1 indicates that there is a higher proportion of cases in the age group relative to other age groups, after considering differences in the size of the population. adapted from natale et al. [17] .among covid-19 patients, elderly patients have a higher mortality rate due to high cfr and symptomatic infection rate. approximately 80% and 90% of deaths have occurred in patients aged >70 years and ≥60 years in korea and italy, respectively [5, 7] . a similar pattern was observed in other countries affected by covid-19. several studies have reported old age to be a significant risk factor for covid-19 mortality [19, 20] . age also affects the time from hospitalization to death and viral clearance [21, 22] . in an animal study, sars-cov-2 caused more severe interstitial pneumonia and viral replication in lung tissues of old monkeys than in those of young monkeys [23] .in immunopathology, vulnerability to an infection in the elderly is usually explained by immunosenescence [24] . immunosenescence is quite complicated. briefly, in old age, the production of naïve t and b cells decreases, and the function of innate immune cells is impaired; hence, cells involved in the innate immunity do not get activated efficiently during an infection, and progression to an adaptive immune response does not occur in a coordinated manner [24] . these changes reduce the effectiveness of viral clearance and increase the likelihood of triggering a dysregulated immune response in which cytokines are released extensively by activated immune cells, resulting in a cytokine storm [25] . another well-recognized feature of aging immunity is chronic subclinical systemic inflammation, also known as inflammaging. inflammation is a key pathogenic mechanism in covid-19; hence, inflammaging has been estimated to contribute to the poorer outcome in elderly patients with covid- 19 [26] .some scientists have claimed that the biologically plausible pathomechanism explaining the difference in vulnerability to sars-cov-2 infection involves the so-called antibodydependent enhancement (ade) [27] [28] [29] [30] . ade is a well-known cascade of events by which viruses may infect susceptible cells through interactions between virions complexed with antibodies and fc receptors, where they are more extensively endocytosed and eventually replicated more efficiently [31] . the antibodies that bind to virions could be neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies, which were previously formed in response to sars-cov-2 or other coronaviruses with similar antigenicity to that of sars-cov-2. the fact that the seroprevalence of community-acquired coronaviruses among adults was very high (90 -100%) [32] but not in pediatrics was presented as an evidence [33] .in addition to the aging immunity or ade, there are several other factors related to aging that could be reasons for higher mortality and morbidity in the elderly. the average number of comorbid conditions steadily increased with age. according to liu et al., elderly covid-19 patients had a significantly higher performance score than young and middle-aged patients [34] . in addition, older adults living in long-term care facilities are at the highest risk because of their chronic illness and the impact of congregate housing [35] .based on published data, sars-cov-2 infection seems to affect children less frequently and less severely than adults. according to the data published from different regions, the proportion of children among covid-19 patients was quite low (2.1 -2.4% in china, 1.3% in italy, 2.8% in australia, and 7.0% in korea) [5-7, 36, 37] . in the largest pediatric study to date that analyzed 2,143 children infected with sars-cov-2, 5.8% children showed severe and critical illness [38] . contrary to the pediatric study, 18.5% patients were severe and critical among all age groups in an analysis of 44,672 chinese cases with covid-19 [6] . among children, dong et al. found that infants were relatively more vulnerable to sars-cov-2 infection, and the proportion of severe and critical cases was 10.7% [38] . however, because the study also included suspected cases (not laboratory confirmed cases, 65.9% of study population), the possibility of pathogens other than sars-cov-2 responsible for such clinical observations remains controversial. in other studies, even though very small number of cases was reported, a severe outcome in infants was not observed [39] [40] [41] . although these findings were not similar to the generally accepted fact that children aged <5 years were more vulnerable to respiratory viral infections, there was a common aspect with the previous finding observed in sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) epidemics, which also had a children-sparing pattern [42] [43] [44] . stockman et al. reported that the clinical outcome of sars was more favorable in children aged <12 years of age than in other age groups [43] . no deaths were reported in children with sars-cov infection [44] . in the mers-cov epidemic, only two pediatric deaths were reported, both of which had serious comorbidities: infantile nephrotic syndrome and cystic fibrosis [45] [46] [47] .thus far, there is no clear explanation for the children-sparing pattern of sars-cov-2 infection. the following hypotheses have been reported in the literature: 1) the possibility that children are less frequently exposed to infection sources due to closure of child care facilities, preschools, and schools, 2) children are less susceptible to the infection itself, and 3) children are less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms; hence, the number of cases is underestimated [48] [49] [50] . more evidence and studies are needed to prove the hypotheses. however, recently, bi et al reported the result of tracing 1,286 close contacts in china; children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate in children aged <10 years: 7.4% vs. population average: 6.6%) but less likely to be symptomatic or develop severe symptoms [51] .a milder symptom or low cfr in children with sars-cov-2 infection could be explained by the interaction between host immunological response and viral pathogen mechanism [48, 50] . as the differences in the distribution, maturation, and function of viral receptors in the host are frequently reported as a possible reason for the age-related difference in infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), a receptor for sars-cov, hcov-nl63, and sars-cov-2, has attracted increasing attention. ace2 plays a key role is in catalyzing the hydrolysis of angiotensin ii into angiotensin (1-7), which has an antihypertensive and profibrotic effect [52, 53] . following viral entry, ace2 expression is downregulated [54] . downregulation of ace2 expression leads to compensatory overproduction of angiotensin ii by ace. angiotensin ii, in turn, stimulates its type 1a receptor, which increases the lung vascular permeability and potentiates lung pathology [55] [56] [57] . in a study conducted by xie et al., ace2 expression was observed to dramatically decrease with aging in a rat model [58] . low levels of ace2 have been detected in patients with underlying chronic conditions, which generally do not affect the pediatric population [53, 59] . these findings suggest that increased levels of ace2 receptors in lung pneumocytes in children may have a protective effect from severe clinical manifestations of sars-cov-2 infection [48, 50, 60] .more active and rapid innate immune response to an antigen and an elevated number of b lymphocytes, t lymphocytes, and natural killer cells are also suggested as an immunological mechanism for children to resist an infection [61] [62] [63] . however, these general immunological characteristics of children are insufficient to explain the children-sparing pattern of sars-cov-2, which is a distinctive feature from other respiratory viral infections.as it is known that many children are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, there are increasing concerns on children's role in transmitting disease. however, the importance of children in transmitting the virus remains uncertain. the majority of the children infected with sars-cov-2 reported thus far have a documented household contact, often showing symptoms before infected children, suggesting the possibility that children are not an important reservoir for sars-cov-2.another emerging children-related issue is a multisystem inflammatory syndrome mentioned in a scientific brief report published by the who on may 15, 2020 [64] . the report describes clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units; these children have a multisystem inflammatory condition, with some features similar to those of kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome, in europe and north america [65] [66] [67] . this syndrome has not been reported in other regions thus far, but the full spectrum of the disease is still unclear. hence, special attention should be warranted to all children with covid-19 [68] .the cfr and susceptibility to symptomatic covid-19 is higher in the elderly. as there is no definitive therapeutic drug or a vaccine, prevention is the only and the most important strategy for older adults; the added strain of social distancing on this vulnerable population should be acknowledged and managed. furthermore, studies on immunopathology for determining the severity of sars-cov-2 infection are warranted to develop more effective therapeutic and preventive strategies.• first study covering all countries affected by covid-19 verifying the association with climate variables. • negative association between country average temperature and covid-19 infections. • positive associations between country precipitation and covid-19 infections. • no association between deaths and country temperature or precipitation.a b s t r a c t a r t i c l e i n f othis is the third time in less than two decades that the world authorities are facing an epidemic with high transmissibility, caused by subtypes of a coronavirus (munster et al., 2020; gorbalenya, 2020) . the first epidemic occurred during [2002] [2003] in guangdong province, china. the disease was termed 'severe acute respiratory syndrome' (sars) and was caused by a newly identified coronavirus that was named sars coronavirus (sars-cov) (lin et al., 2006) . sars-cov infected 8000 individuals from several countries and resulted in 774 deaths. the second epidemic occurred in 2012 in the middle east. this disease was termed 'middle east respiratory syndrome' and was caused by a new virus called mers coronavirus (mers-cov). mers-cov infected 2494 individuals and resulted in around 860 deaths (munster et al., 2020) . at the end of 2019, a third epidemic occurred. this was caused by another new type of coronavirus designated by the world health organization as sars-cov-2. the resultant disease was named 'coronavirus disease' ; the disease is now a worldwide pandemic (gorbalenya, 2020) .the recently emerged sars-cov-2 was first identified in the city of wuhan, hubei province, china. the virus infects humans and a variety of animals, mainly pigs and bats (velavan and meyer, 2020) . infection results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, which are mainly respiratory, ranging in severity from benign to lethal, and it is sometimes asymptomatic (velavan and meyer, 2020; fehr and perlman, 2015) .in an attempt to understand these epidemics, studies have examined factors that could influence the spread of coronaviruses (chan et al., 2011) . in general, three factors affect the epidemiology of communicable diseases: the agent of transmission, the host, and the environment (lin et al., 2006) .historically, the occurrences of sars were partly associated with environmental factors (lin et al., 2006) . an ecological study conducted in china found that air pollution was associated with lethality in individuals affected by sars. this was attributed to the fact that short-or long-term exposure to certain pollutants can compromise lung function (cui et al., 2003) . another environmental factor was air temperature. lin et al. (2006) identified, for the first time, that the incidence of sars was 18 times higher at lower air temperatures than at higher temperatures. the authors reported that respiratory system diseases are more common in colder environments and that the virulence of agents deteriorates at higher climatic temperatures, as they may not be able to withstand the environmental changes. in addition, they pointed out that the transmissibility of sars-cov, in terms of climatic fluctuations, is similar to that of the influenza virus. furthermore, the incidence of influenza increases significantly with low temperatures and high relative humidity (park, 2020) , indicating that climatic factors can significantly affect viral transmission.in the case of sars-cov-2, meteorological factors seem to influence the spread of the virus (oliveiros et al., 2020; bao et al., 2016) . oliveiros et al. (2020) identified that the speed of transmission was positively correlated with temperature and correlated with humidity. thus, it is expected that if the temperature rises to 20°c, transmission rates increase by an average of 1.8 days. regarding temperature and mortality rate, a study conducted in four chinese cities found that colder temperatures had a greater effect on mortality (bao et al., 2016) . this is in contrast to the results of the study by li et al. (2019) , which showed that both cold and heat can adversely impact the mortality resulting from respiratory syndromes.on the basis of the assumption that different climatic conditions play a significant role in the course of covid-19, it is essential to identify associations between environmental factors, such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures; precipitation; and demographic density, and sars-cov-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality in humans.data for the period from december 1, 2019 to march 30, 2020 were collected. for meteorological variables, weather station data were extracted from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) database. daily data from meteorological stations were segregated by country, and the following variables were recorded: precipitation, average temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature (noaa, 2020). daily averages of each meteorological variable for the different countries were calculated. finally, data on daily infection and death rates were extracted from world health organization reports (who, 2020).the demographic density of each country was used as a control variable, with data obtained from the food and agriculture organization and world bank population estimates for the year 2018 (world bank, 2020). the country's time of exposure to the epidemic was calculated from the temporal distance, in days, between the first case registered in the territory and the time of study. a summary of the variables is provided in table 1 .to analyze the association between the number of cases of and deaths from covid-19 and climatic aspects, we used eq. (1), as estimated by a panel data strategy (wooldridge, 2002) : where y it is the dependent variable (total number of cases of sars-cov-2 infections or total number of deaths from covid-19) for 249 countries "i" over the period "t" from december 1, 2019 to march 30, 2020; σ is a constant; u i is the control for specific characteristics of the countries that are fixed over the analyzed period; and x it is a vector that includes all explanatory variables of the model, including the variable of interest, that is, the mean temperature.in addition, we included other controls that may be related to the disease, such as average rainfall and the country's time of exposure to the epidemic. we included as binary variables d t , which captures specific effects associated with the months of january and february, and ε it , which is the error term of this equation that includes all factors that are associated with y it and are not included in the equation.the advantage of this strategy in relation to a traditional ordinary least squares estimate is that we can control for some country-specific factors that are fixed in time and associated with the number of deaths associated with sars-cov-2 infection.two specific outcomes measures were considered. for the first, we analyzed the influence of climatic variables on sars-cov-2 infections, and for the second, we analyzed the influence of climatic variables on covid-19 mortality.three estimates were tested for each outcome and are shown in fig. 1 . the first included only the average temperature; the second included the average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, and the country's time of exposure to the epidemic; and the third included the average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, the country's time of exposure to the epidemic, population density, and a variable to capture the specific month effects (complete specification). table 2 shows the results of correlation analysis between the number of confirmed covid-19 cases and the average temperature by country. in the first estimated model, there is a negative correlation between the two variables. the significance of this relationship remains even after the inclusion of additional variables such as maximum and minimum temperatures (averages) and time of exposure to the disease. even with the complete specification that includes two binary variables capturing specific effects for the months of the year and controlling for population density, the results suggest that an increase in temperature is associated with a decrease in the number of infections.the coefficients shown in table 2 cannot measure causality. there are several other factors that can affect the variable of interest, on which we do not have information, such as the number of beds and the patients' respective levels of social isolation. however, an association was observed between the climate and the number of covid-19 cases. these models appear to be quite robust, particularly after the incorporation of controls such as additional climate variables and also month fixed effects. table 3 shows the results of correlation analysis between covid-19 mortality and climatic variables. for this outcome measure, there were no significant associations between the coefficients and mortality or average temperature. it is possible that factors other than climate are related to mortality. in the first estimate, we evaluated only the relationship between covid-19 mortality rates and the average temperature by country, which was significant. in the second estimate, we included the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures as well as the country's time of exposure to the disease and did not identify any significant association. in the last estimate, in addition to the controls already included in the previous specification, we also incorporated binary variables to capture any effects that were specific to this period. however, no significant correlation was identified between covid-19 mortality rates and temperature.several factors can influence sar-cov-2 transmission, including environmental variables, population density, and medical care . this study aimed to identify the associations between environmental variables and sars-cov-2 transmission/covid-19 mortality. a negative correlation was identified between temperature and the number infections.although it is known that the influence of temperature on human health can vary between countries and even regions (hajat and kosatky, 2010) , the findings of this study are in agreement with the current literature in that temperature influences the transmission of viruses that cause respiratory syndromes, such as the influenza virus (park, 2020) and sars-cov-2 (ma et al., 2020) . by investigating the relationship between temperature and respiratory diseases, studies have indicated that sars-cov and the influenza virus survive only under certain climatic conditions and that their transmissibility is sensitive to rising temperatures (jaakkola et al., 2014; chan et al., 2011) , similar to the transmissibility of sars-cov-2 .the influenza virus is more transmissible at lower temperatures (lowen and steel, 2014) because cold weather results in the weakening of host immunity, increasing susceptibility to infection (kudo et al., 2019) . considering that the transmissibility of coronaviruses is similar to that of the influenza virus (lin et al., 2006) , it can be assumed that these mechanisms also apply to the transmission of sars-cov-2 .in the model in which we considered only the average temperature, the observed correlation indicated that for every one degree fahrenheit increase in temperature, there was a reduction in the number of infections by 1.44 cases/day. under the composite model (estimate 3 of outcome measure 1), the association was stronger in that there was a decrease in the number of infections by 6.40 cases/day for each degree increase in temperature.the second finding of this study was the significant association between mortality and average temperature, which was not maintained when other variables were added, indicating that non-climatic variables may be related to covid-19 mortality. this finding differs from the findings of ma et al. (2020) , who stated that temperature and covid-19 mortality are negatively associated. one possible reason for the conflicting results is the limited geographical scope of the study by ma et al., which focused only on china and its climate. our study included data from a range of countries and climatic regions.environmental factors that influence the relationship between temperature and mortality, such as latitude (bao et al., 2016) ; humidity (jaakkola et al., 2014; kudo et al., 2019) ; air pollution (cai et al., 2007) ; and sociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, and income (bao et al., 2016) , have been reported. chan et al. (2011) reported that people who live at low latitudes have a relatively weak adaptive capacity to cold and a strong adaptive capacity to heat, and the reverse has also been shown. high humidity, which is associated with low temperatures, is an important factor in the transmissibility of the influenza virus, either by conserving virulence or weakening the host by cooling the body or drying the respiratory tract (jaakkola et al., 2014) .a study reported that temperature and humidity are associated with a higher risk of covid-19 . therefore, although humidity was not considered in our research because of the lack of information on this variable from some meteorological stations, precipitation seems to be an important factor that must be considered. we found that there was a positive correlation between precipitation and sars-cov-2 transmission, showing that for each 1-in. increase in precipitation/day, there was an increase of 56.01 cases/day.another result concerns the country's time of exposure to sars-cov-2. as expected, this variable also showed a positive correlation, showing that for each additional day of exposure there was an average increase of 15.73 cases/day. this finding is consistent with the behavioral evidence on sars-cov-2 transmission, that is, after community infection, transmission follows the same geometric progression (correia et al., 2020) .it is important to mention that our study only interpreted the significance of the coefficients and not their magnitude because of the probable existence of endogeneity in the estimated relationships, considering that a series of regressors are associated with temperature and disease mortality at the same time.this is the first global study covering all countries affected by covid-19. we examined the associations between climatic variables and sars-cov-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality. the findings showed a negative correlation between a country's average temperature and the number of covid-19 cases, the absence of a correlation between mortality and the average temperature, and a positive correlation between the country's time of exposure to the virus and the number of cases. in addition, this study reported that precipitation as an important factor in the transmissibility of the virus.this research provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health authorities. as climatic variations are associated with the transmissibility of sars-cov-2, new policies to reinforce health systems or social isolation methods can be adopted, depending on temperature and precipitation patterns.as a limitation, we highlight the absence of humidity data, in view of its important role in the virulence of respiratory syndromes. however, because of the current data restrictions, this factor could not be considered, and it should be included in future studies. we also suggest that future studies focus on micro-regions to capture temperature patterns and include variables related to solar radiation. the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.the uk is currently in the middle of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) pandemic. the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), is a novel strain of coronavirus previously unidentified in humans and thought to be of zoonotic origin [1] . sars-cov-2 exposure may result in a wide variety of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infection to the development of respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support [2] . covid-19 is extremely contagious and as of 20 may 2020, there were over 250 000 cases and 35 000 deaths reported in the uk alone [3, 4] .globally there has been huge disruption to everyday life. without a vaccine or effective treatment, governments are reliant upon strategies such as social distancing and quarantine measures to limit sars-cov-2 infection to a level that can be managed by healthcare systems [5] . furthermore, the additional burden placed on healthcare services will probably affect the quality of care for patients suffering with unrelated health problems. this is of particular relevance to oncologists, as prompt diagnosis and treatment can make significant difference to patient outcomes. in addition, individuals with a significant comorbidity such as cancer may be particularly vulnerable to coronavirus infection as a potential consequence of their immunosuppressed state [6] [7] [8] .this leaves us as oncologists faced with challenging decisions about how to proceed with treatment for patients with cancer. the risks of covid-19 infection have to be incorporated into our decision making and will impact on our practice for months or potentially years to come. this has led to the need to have difficult conversations with patients about how the covid-19 pandemic affects their treatment, with realistic weighing up of the potential benefits and harms that can occur. in our experience, most patients have been remarkably pragmatic about the current situation and the measures we are putting in place, but this is an emotive area and conversations about stopping or delaying treatment are difficult. to effectively and compassionately have these conversations we need to be informed by the best evidence available and at present this is limited. much of the current published literature around covid-19 and cancer are guidelines and the published studies we have are largely based around smaller numbers of patients in the chinese population.the liang et al. [7] study included 18 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of both covid-19 and cancer out of a total of 2007 cases. this study noted worse outcomes in the cancer cohort, with seven (39%) suffering a severe adverse outcome compared with 124 (8%) overall [7] . the report by zhang et al. [9] showed similar outcomes, with 15 (53.6%) of 28 included patients suffering severe events with a 28.6% mortality rate (eight deaths). yu et al. [8] identified 12 cancer patients from their population of 1524, three of whom died.the largest currently reported cohort of patients compared 105 patients with both covid-19 and cancer with 536 matched non-cancer patients [10] , reporting a higher rate of both mortality ([aq1]or 2.34) and intensive care unit admission ([aq1]or 2.84) in patients with cancer compared with the control group. in particular, higher rates of mortality ([aq1]or 5.58) and intensive care unit admission ([aq1]or 6.59) were observed in stage iv cancer patients; non-metastatic cancer patients had similar outcomes to the matched control group. cancer patients also had a longer mean length of stay at 27 days compared with 17.75 days in the control group.patients with lung cancer were the largest cohort represented in these studies. dai et al. [10] reported that lung cancer represented 20.95%, followed by gastrointestinal 12.38% and breast 10.48%, with haematological cancer representing 8.57% of cases [10] . although a smaller proportion of total cases, the highest mortality rate was noted in patients with haematological cancers (33.3% of nine patients); lung cancer patients had a mortality rate of 18.8% (four of 22 cases). with the limitations on hospital resources meaning the usual support to manage anticancer treatment toxicities are potentially reduced or unavailable and with the additional risk to patients with cancer who contract a concurrent covid-19 infection [7, 8] , oncological treatments that may confer an unacceptable risk as perceived by patients and clinicians are being altered, cancelled or deferred. guidance has been produced as to how to best balance the risks of treating against the risks of changing away from the standard treatment, such as the royal college of radiologists' guidelines for radiotherapy during the covid-19 pandemic [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .pragmatically, in the absence of a definite understanding of how covid-19 will affect patients with cancer, the key approach has been to minimise the chance of the patient contracting covid-19 infection. a number of strategies have already been adopted by the majority of uk cancer centres to mitigate this risk, including delivery of outpatient reviews by telephone rather than in the clinic, deferral of nonurgent anticancer treatments and shortening of radiotherapy fractionation schedules. the available evidence of efficacy [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] has been balanced against what we know of the risks from covid-19 to form consensus guidance.the available studies note that recent treatment affected outcomes, but this impact differed between modalities and small patient numbers limit the ability to draw conclusions. liang et al. [7] reported severe adverse events in three of four patients treated [aq2]within a month; zhang et al. [9] noted more frequent adverse events in those treated within 14 days (hazard ratio 4, n = 6) and dai et al. [10] reported that patients receiving radiotherapy (12.26%) within 40 days prior to infection did not show worse outcomes compared with the age-matched controls, but the six patients (5.7%) receiving immunotherapy had a 33% mortality rate. this poor outcome was hypothesised to relate to an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by a cytokine storm and contrasts with bersanelli's [23] hypothesis that immunotherapy could be protective against covid-19, although noting the possibility that immune toxicity such as pneumonitis and covid-19 infection coinciding could cause worse outcomes and that both covid-19 and anti-pdl1 agents can cause a cytokine release syndrome leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome.despite the uncertainty about which treatments are safe to continue and the full extent of the risks from the covid-19 pandemic, the risk to patients from the underlying malignancy should not be ignored. although considering nine paediatric patients, hrusak et al. [24] noted that the risks of harm from untreated malignancy appeared to outweigh the risks from covid-19 in the paediatric population. although potentially children are less impacted by covid-19 compared with adults, this would emphasise the importance of continuing to treat patients where safe to do so. as more evidence of the true impact of covid-19 on the uk population becomes available, we will need to continue to review the guidelines to make the best use of the evidence available to support safe practice and enable an informed discussion with patients about the risks of treatment [25] [26] [27] [28] . despite the increased difficulty of treating cancer patients at present, medical professionals from around the uk have shown themselves to be adaptable and resilient. this collaborative, crossdisciplinary approach has been hugely important in optimising the delivery of patient care, enabled by our ability to share information about our experiences. a core part of this going forward will be the uk coronavirus cancer monitoring project, which aims to monitor the impact of covid-19 on cancer patients and enable oncologists to gain crucial insights and inform clinical-and infrastructure-based decision making. the uk coronavirus cancer monitoring project was launched on 18 march 2020 following discussions between clinical oncologists in our cancer centres. the project consists of a local emergency response reporting group at each of our cancer centres and enables data collection on sars-cov-2-positive cancer patients. the primary end point measure of this study will be all-cause mortality following a hospitalisation for a laboratory confirmed sars-cov-2 infection. the project will attempt to define factors that are associated with increased mortality/morbidity from covid-19, including patient factors (age, gender, comorbidities, smoking status, and ethnicity), cancer factors (subtype, stage), cancer treatment (intent, modality, line of treatment) and covid-19 symptoms and treatments.to date, there are over a 1300 patients in the registry. potentially of interest to the readership is that there are >100 patients who have had radiotherapy within 4 weeks of admission. this subgroup is increasing in size and will hopefully enable the clinical oncology community to answer some of the aforementioned clinical questions given enough time and collaboration. therefore, we believe this pan-uk information is key to understanding the interactions between covid-19 and our treatment regimens.the project will continue to analyse and disseminate data in real time. this will enable our cancer centres to assess the impact coronavirus is having on cancer patients, assess the impact of our treatment interventions and potentially allow the maintenance of the best possible standard of cancer patient care within challenging circumstances.for more information about the uk coronavirus cancer monitoring project, see

of interest are declared.towns in the four northern italian provinces of milano, bergamo, brescia, and lodi were heavily infected with the coronavirus in the first few months of 2020. some towns had substantial excess mortality:• nembro, 147 extra deaths, population 11,526, excess mortality 1.275 percent• alzano lombardo, 102 extra deaths, population 13,655, excess mortality 0.75 percent if the towns had been fully infected during this period the excess mortality would provide an estimate of mortality due to covid-19. since the towns may have been less than fully infected these provide lower bounds.the excess mortality provides a valuable bound for covid-19 mortality and it would generalizing the idea to multiple towns provides better precision in the estimates, and opens the way for estimating mortality by age and sex. a poisson count model provides the statistical framework to pool data across towns, estimating age-and sex-specific mortality rates, while controlling for differences across towns in the degree of excess mortality. there are 612 towns with deaths by age and sex available from istat for january 1 through april 15 for the years 2017-2020 in the northern provinces of milano, bergamo, brescia, and lodi -a population of 5,753,296 or 98 percent of the regional population.town-specific random effects control for differences across towns in the level of excess mortality which presumably results from differences in infection rates, and also provide a method for estimating mortality for the most-infected towns. the upper tail (99th percentile) of the town distribution corresponds to the highest-mortality towns -presumably those most infected by the coronavirus. the 99th percentile out of 612 towns is roughly the 606th town, so at the upper tail but not simply the most-infected town. table 1 shows overall excess mortality of 1.09 percent (95% ci 1.06-1.14), 1 an ifr higher than many published estimates (e.g. ioannidis [2020] (surveying published studies) reports 0.02 percent to 0.40 percent; cdc [2020] uses an "upper bound" for disease severity of case fatality rate 1 percent and asymptomatic case percentage of 50 percent, implying an ifr of 0.5 percent; grewelle and leo [2020] does estimate a higher global ifr (1.04 percent), but this is equal to our lower bound). the ifr shows a dramatic age and sex profile: men age 65-74 have excess mortality 12-times higher than younger men and 2.7-times higher than women of the same age. applying the age-and sex-specific excess mortality to the u.s. age profile produces a bound for the u.s. overall ifr of 0.87 percent - table 2 .these estimates of all-cause excess mortality provide particularly firm and useful bounds for covid-19 mortality because they do not depend on the assumptions often necessary with other measures. they do not depend on ascribing cause of death or determining exposure or proportion asymptomatic infections.these excess mortality estimates provide lower bounds for covid-19 ifr in realistic circumstances, but we need to discuss their interpretation. the infection fatality rate (ifr) is a key variable in epidemiological modeling and is usually considered a constant, but in reality ifr can vary with circumstances. there are three channels through which a covid-19 epidemic will affect mortality. the first is death caused directly by covid-19 but under "good medical treatment." we might call this the "clinical" or "best-case" ifr and this is what is usually meant when discussing the ifr. the second is higher mortality still caused directly by covid-19 but due to ineffective or lesser medical care that may exist during the initial outbreak or disorganized medical conditions. the third is excess mortality from other causes due to disorganized medical treatment, for example cardiac cases not seeking or receiving adequate care -not technically part of the ifr but still mortality resulting from the disease. 2 the three channels combined we might label the "initial response," "real-world," or "worst-case" ifr -due not only to the clinical conditions of infection but also to real-world treatment challenges and the "fog of war" in fighting a new disease.reports on the response of hospitals and icu beds in lombardy (e.g. manca [2020] , grasselli et al. [2020] ) indicate that the medical system was stressed but not overwhelmed and hospitals responded with large increases in icu capacity. from anecdotal reports it appears that increased mortality due to the third channel (non-treatment of non-covid conditions) was small, and due to the second channel (ineffective covid care) was probably not substantial. nonetheless, as time, knowledge, and medical practice progresses this initial response ifr will likely decrease.the estimates in table 1 provide benchmarks against which to compare parameters used in epidemiological modeling. in this respect it is instructive to examine recent cdc simulations (cdc [2020] ). re-weighting our age-specific estimates for us population (as shown in table 2 ) we find 0.87 percent overall and 3.95 percent for age 65+. the cdc scenario 5 ("current best estimates") assumes 35 percent asymptomatic cases and case fatality rates of 0.4 percent overall, 0.2 percent for 55-64, and 1.3 percent for age 65+, implying ifr of 0.26 percent overall, 0.13 percent for 55-64, and 0.845 percent age 65+. these are substantially lower than the observations from northern italy and raise the question of whether u.s. mortality will in fact be improved relative to italy by a factor of three. 3by estimating excess mortality using fixed effects for demographic and town effects, we can examine townby-town mortality while still pooling data across demographics and towns. table 3 shows six towns between the 98th and 99th percentile with the highest predicted overall mortality. 4 there are a number of towns in the tail of the overall mortality distribution (for examplegazzaniga, castiglione d'adda, and nembro) that have moderate populations and statistically significant estimated fixed effects. this indicates that the estimates from the tail of the random effects estimator shown in table 1 are not simply a statistical artifact: 2 there is a fourth possible source for the observed increase in mortality: some unobserved confounding factor that increased mortality in northern italian towns in spring 2020. although logically possible this is unlikely to be a major factor in this case, particularly given two observations: the clear identification of a mechanism (virus and disease) causing increased mortality globally, and significant increases in mortality in northern italian towns that occurred at the same time as identified covid-19 infection and in tandem in all groups except the youngest.3 the cdc scenario 3 has the highest implied ifr of 0.8 percent overall and 2.56 percent for 65+, still lower than our lower bounds.4 the age-specific mortality is predicted for each town, then weighted using that town's population weights.3 . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 12, 2020. . estimates for the upper tail of the random effects estimator and for individual towns tell the same story of high excess mortality for highly-infected towns. 5 towns between roughly the 98th and 99th percentiles in the distribution of overall predicted excess mortality (towns 599 to 604 out of 612 towns)the "actual" excess mortality for males aged 55-64 and 65-74 also show why pooling across the towns is valuable. towns with low population will have substantial random variation, particularly for groups with low mortality. even if the overall town mortality is enough to provide reliable overall mortality estimates, the age-specific mortality measures may not be reliable. the town of valbondione provides an example. the town has a population of 606 with only 57 men aged 55-64. with one death in 2019 versus none in 2020 the town has a large negative excess mortality, when in fact the variation in number of deaths is likely due to random chance given the small size of the relevant population.there are 612 towns (comunes) having data provided by istat in the four provinces of milano, bergamo, brescia, and lodi. table 4 shows summary statistics. the median town population is 4,108. median observed mortality for 2020 was 0.58 percent, with the median excess mortality 0.25 percent. 6there is substantial variation in 2020 mortality across towns, and substantially more than in 2019. the interquartile range is 0.39 percentage points, versus 0.19 percentage points in 2019. this variation in observed mortality, which carries over to the excess mortality, is presumably due to the variation across towns in overall 5 the predicted overall morality from the random effects estimation shown in table 1 is lower than for these towns at the 99th percentile. this effect, shrinkage of the random effects distribution, is a characteristic of mixed models -see clark [2019] . 6 observed excess mortality is calculated as the difference between the 2020 mortality and 2019 mortality on a town-by-town basis, so the median of the excess mortality may not equal the difference in the medians of 2020 and 2019. the predicted excess mortality is calculated from the fixed effects estimator as 2020 predicted mortality versus the pre-2020 mortality estimated using 2017, 2018, 2019.. cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who

preprint infection rates. this variation, and particularly the upper tail of the distribution of excess mortality across towns, is what we can exploit to calculate lower bounds for ifr. using the raw mortality for estimating ifr bounds by specific age and sex groupingsx presents problems, however. some towns have low population and for groups with low underlying mortality rates, purely random variation will sometimes produce a small number of excess deaths. in towns with small populations such excess deaths translate into unusually high mortality rates, and these high rates will bias upwards the upper tail of the across-town distribution. table 4 shows the problem. for the median town males 15-54 have low overall mortality and zero excess mortality. in contrast, the upper tail (the 99th percentile) shows a high observed excess mortality of 0.33 percent. this is not a reliable estimate. the poisson mixed effects model provides more reliable estimates. figures 1 and 2 shows the location of the towns. figure 1 is a simple quantile map, showing towns by their predicted 2020 excess mortality. figure 2 clusters towns by the excess mortality and contiguity (euclidean distance). the maps indicate that mortality was high around bergamo and particularly in the valleys north-east of bergamo. milan and surroundings appear to have been more lightly infected. is the

demographic groups each with a large number of observations (307 towns for each of pre-and post-2020). i can of course also examine this by treating all factors as fixed.) in this case the combined

the number of deaths is:for now i am going to think about mortality rather than ifr and infection separately:in equation 1 the terms α 00 + γ 00 + γ 0j represent the pre-2020 age-specific mortality for the median town. the terms α 10 + γ 10 + γ 1j represent the age-specific excess mortality for the median town. the terms α 0i represent the random variation in pre-2020 town-specific mortality, and α 1i the 2020 town-specific excess mortality.the demographic effects are treated as fixed effects to be estimated:• α 00 + γ 00 + γ 0j -8 parameters (demographic groups) pre-covid (pre-2020)• α 10 + γ 10 + γ 1j -8 parameters (demographic groups) for covid mortality (2020) the town effects (α 0i and α 1i ) can be treated as either fixed or random effects. there are 612 towns in the most-affected regions (milano, bergamo, brescia, lodi) . the gives either 1,116x fixed effects (612 for for pre-2020 and 612 for 2020) or two random effects (one for pre-2020 and one for 2020).the pre-2020 effects measures inherent base-case mortality differences across towns. (these are not due to different age and sex distributions since population and mortality are measured by the eight demographic categories listed above.) these pre-2020 effects are estimated using mortality from 2017, 2018, 2019. the 2020 effects provide for differences across towns in excess of their pre-2020 mortality. these mortality differences presumably result from different infection rates across towns, and possibly other factors such as the care and treatment provided locally.fixed effects estimators are appropriate for estimating specific town mortality, controlling for both pre-covid mortality levels and noise in the 2020 mortality. towns with low population will have low mortality counts and substantial variability in the counts. across a large sample of towns some towns will produce large rates simply due to random variation. randomly high counts for small towns will translate into high rates, potentially biasing any observations using raw rates.8 . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 12, 2020. .predicted mortality for town-specific rates using the fixed effects estimates will be more reliable than raw observations, particularly by demographic group. i am pooling age-specific counts across all towns to estimate age-specific rates, and pooling town-specific counts across age groups to estimate each town fixed effect. standard errors for estimated fixed effects provide information on the confidence we should assign to townspecific estimates.random effects will be more appropriate for estimating the overall effect of covid-19. the estimated pre-2020 age-specific mortality effects (α 0i ) provide estimates for the "average" town pre-covid. the 2020 effects (α 1i ) estimate excess mortality for the "average" 2020 town -average in pre-2020 mortality and in 2020 infection rate. table 5 shows the coefficients for estimating equation 1 as a mixed effect poisson count model, with the town effects treated as random and the demographic effects as fixed. using these estimates i can calculate predicted counts and thus predicted rates for the eight demographic groups both pre-covid and for 2020. if we set the random effects at zero we will estimate excess mortality for the middle of the random effects distribution -i.e. the median town in terms of both pre-covid and 2020 mortality. these results are shown in table 8 below. 8 r using glmer from the lme4 package, with optimizer = "bobyqa". note how the fixed effects are parametrized: overall 2020 effect (the difference between pre-2020 and 2020 "intercept") is excluded, so that all the age-specific 2020 effects are measured relative to pre-2020. the reported standard errors are appropriate for testing for individual age-specific effects are different from zero. if the standard r parametrization were used the overall 2020 effect would be included and the f0-14 excluded, so testing one of the age-specific 2020 effects would require testing the sum (overall2020ef f ect + age-spef icif ef f ect), the standard error for which would involve the correlation between the coefficients.we want the predicted excess mortality for the upper tail of the distribution -for towns that had high excess mortality and were thus, presumably, heavily infected. the estimated distribution of the 2020 random effect (α 1i ) measures this right tail (more infected towns) and will provide a lower bound for age-specific ifr. we use the 99th percentile of the α 1i distribution. if the estimated 2020 demographic fixed effect for a group j iŝ α 10 +γ 10 +γ 1j and the variance of the α 1i distribution isσ town,2020 then the 99th percentile (2.5σ) of the 2020 mortality will be larger than the pre-2020 mortality by the factor exp (α 10 +γ 10 +γ 1j + 2.5 ·σ town,2020 ). the excess mortality for group j will be exp (α 00 +γ 00 +γ 0j ) · [exp (α 10 +γ 10 +γ 1j + 2.5 ·σ town,2020 ) − 1] .the coefficients in table 5 show the age and sex profile of mortality in ratio terms (while the excess mortality in table 1 show it as differences in rates -equation 2). mortality for demographic group j for the 99thpercentile town increased by the factor exp (α 10 +γ 10 +γ 1j + 2.5 ·σ town,2020 ). these increases, as a ratio to the pre-2020 mortality, are shown in table 6 ; they are large and larger for older men. male mortality is higher than female pre-covid at every age, with the ratio given by exp (γ 0f j − γ 0m j ).the ratio exp (γ 1f j − γ 1m j ) measures how much the ratio increases in 2020. table 7 shows summary statistics and test for the random and fixed effects models. i estimate three nested models for each the random and fixed effect specification. the first includes no estimates for 2020 effectssetting α 10 + γ 10 + γ 1j and α 1i to zero. the second includes town-specific effects, estimating α 1i . for both random and fixed effects models a likelihood ratio test shows that town-specific 2020 effects are important. the third model includes 2020 age-specific excess mortality effectsα 10 + γ 10 + γ 1j . again, a likelihood ratio test shows that these effects are highly significant.the residual deviance in table 7 provides a test for whether the poisson regression adequately accounts for the observed variation -whether there is "overdispersion" relative to the poisson assumption. the residual deviance is asymptotically χ 2 -distributed: a large value implies that the model does not account for the data very well. for both the random and the fixed effects model, the residual deviance is small relative to a χ 2 random variable -the probability of observing a value as large or larger than reported is 1.0.for reference, table 8 shows the estimated excess mortality for the median town, towns with presumably modest overall infection rate.calculating standard errors for the excess mortality is difficult. for a specific age group this would be the 99th percentile 2020 rate less the base-case pre-2020 rate shown in equation 2. standard errors for that expression is not easy because it is a non-linear expression of the coefficients. one might try doing so by the delta-method but that is complicated by two factors: first the standard error forσ town,2020 is not easy to obtain, and second we want to aggregate age-and sex-specific rates to overall rates using regional 10 . cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 12, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.20125005 doi: medrxiv preprint excess mortality rates calculated by eight age-sex categories then weighted to totals using age-specific population in the regions of milano, bergamo, brescia, and lodi. non-parametric bootstrap confidence intervals.population weights, leading to weighted averages of terms like equation 2. the most feasible alternative is bootstrapping. non-parametric bootstrapping where towns are sampled from the original distribution and equation 1 re-estimated for each sample. tables 1 and 8 show the results for bootstrapping with 400 samples (sampling with replacement from the town distribution). 100.0% figure 3 shows a histogram of estimated 2020 excess mortality across the 612 towns. this shows how towns varied in their 2020 excess mortality, presumably resulting from different coronavirus infection rates.. cc-by-nd 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

85% of cheetah cubs succumbed to the winston outbreak [6] . fourth, while mortality among humans with sars symptoms and house cats with fcov is low, around 5-10%, cheetahs with aju-cov exhibited the opposite extreme, showing 90% morbidity and over 60% mortality.there are two plausible explanations for the cheetah's extreme sensitivity to aju-cov. one is that slight mutational differences transform a relatively benign coronavirus strain to a virulent 'hot' strain. among coronaviruses this scenario has been proposed, but not proven, for the transition of fecv to fipv in cats [9]. this hypothesis is less likely for the cheetahs, as in the outbreak mentioned above lions became infected concurrently with the cheetahs, but developed no overt symptoms [6] . also, experimental transmission of the aju-cov to three domestic kittens failed to cause disease [6] . perhaps also relevant is that when the human sars-cov was induced in domestic cats, they developed no symptoms [4] .cheetahs are known as the world's fastest land animal but also for their extreme genetic uniformity, a consequence of their escape from extinction some 12,000 years ago. remarkably, unrelated cheetahs accept skin grafts from nonrelatives, a characteristic of highly inbred laboratory strains of mice or rats [8] . the most likely explanation for the high mortality in cheetahs is their genetic uniformity, particularly at immune genes like the mhc. this may have rendered the species susceptible to an emerging virulent strain that had evolved to circumvent the defenses of the first victim. if this hypothesis is correct, the greater genetic diversity of domestic cats and humans may reduce the severity of the epidemic, and also contribute to the occurrence of rare genetically determined sars-cov super-spreaders who can infect with high virulence. this explanation emphasizes the critical role of intrinsic genomic diversity among immune defense genes in any fatal epidemic. as such, the search for explicating genetic susceptibility polymorphisms that may inform prognosis, spread therapy, and prevention of emerging pathogens seems warranted, particularly to anticipate future episodes of the deadly sars coronavirus. coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense rna viruses that vary from 60 nm to 140 nm in diameter, with projections in the form of spikes that give the appearance of a crown, hence the name. up to november 2019 there were four known coronaviruses that presented in humans, causing mild respiratory infections: hku1, nl63, 229e, and oc43. [1] [2] the appearance of a new human coronavirus has recently been described, first reported in the city of wuhan, china. the novel coronavirus, sars-cov-2, is a beta coronavirus, of the subgenus sarbecovirus and the subfamily orthocoronavirinae. the organization of the viral genome of the wuhan human-1 coronavirus was determined through the sequencing alignment of two beta coronaviruses: one associated with humans (sars-cov tor2) and one associated with bats (bat sl-covzc45). [3] [4] the infectious disease due to coronavirus , so-named by the world health organization (who) on february 11, 2020, is caused by the sars-cov-2 virus and is the causal agent of a potentially fatal disease that has become a huge public health problem across the globe. 5 by february 24, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases were registered worldwide, in at least 37 countries, and more than 2,700 deaths, resulting in a worldwide health emergency declared by the who. 6 in mexico, the first case was reported on february 27 and two days later four cases were confirmed by the mexican health department. all cases were traced back to an individual from bergamo, italy. 7 the progression of this pandemic is rising worldwide, and 3,525,116 confirmed cases were reported by may 5, 8 with a mortality rate of 3.4%. in mexico, by that same date, there were 24,905 confirmed j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f cases and 2,271 deaths due to covid-19. 9 even though it is a disease whose most severe manifestations are atypical pneumonia and sepsis, the digestive tract, particularly the liver, has recently been reported to be affected by sars-cov-2. [10] [11] therefore, the aim of the present work was to review the available literature on the topic and provide recommendations related to the role of covid-19 in both healthy and diseased livers. platform (ictrp). the search was carried out within the time frame of january 1, 2020 to april 10, 2020, utilizing the search term "coronavirus" combined with the following terms: "sars-cov-2", "liver", "hepatic", "enzymes", "acute" "chronic", "cirrhosis", "liver failure", "hepatitis", "covid-19" and their spanish equivalents. we found 98 works and included 47 in the present review. the excluded articles were case reports, duplicate publications, or those in a language other than spanish or english.j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o fthe clinical manifestations of covid-19 are varied and range from an asymptomatic state to the more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and multiorgan dysfunction. the common signs and symptoms are fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea, and conjunctivitis, but can progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. 1 in addition, patients with covid-19 infection have also presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, and a low percentage of patients with mers-cov or sars-cov present with similar gastrointestinal complaints. symptoms appear after an incubation period of approximately 5.2 days. 5 a metalloproteinase called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) has been identified as the functional receptor for coronavirus cell entry. ace2 microrna expression has been found in multiple organs and human tissue, including the oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small bowel, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, kidney, brain, biliary epithelium, and liver, making its expression a potential target for infection. 1, [12] [13] [14] [15] thus, the liver is an organ that is affected by covid-19. there is information that the liver, either healthy or presenting with a pre-existing hepatic disease, is a pathophysiologic target for that family of coronaviruses. liver injury (hepatitis) in patients with sars is manifested through mild-to-moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase (alt) and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) during the early disease stage, as well as a decrease in serum albumin and an increase in serum bilirubin levels. autopsy findings in patients with sars show a large number of j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f viral particles, not only in the lungs, but also in parenchymal cells and the vascular endothelium of other organs, including the liver. 12 the incidence of liver injury specifically associated with covid-19 varies from 14.8-53%. the majority of case series have reported alterations in alt and ast, elevated total bilirubin, and low serum albumin. 12 chen et al. reported a case series of 99 cases of pneumonia due to covid-19, in which only one patient had a lesion with a severe hepatocellular pattern and elevated alt and ast, whereas the rest of the patients had moderately elevated aminotransferase levels. a decrease in albumin was present in the majority of the cases. with respect to the coagulation profile, the prothrombin time increased in only 5% of the cases, highlighting an increase in dimer levels in one-third of the patients ( fig. 1 ). 16 likewise, huang et al. found similar liver biochemistry alterations, describing elevated ast levels in 37% of the patients, with a higher number of those cases in the patients that were admitted to the intensive care unit (icu) (62% vs. 25%). 17 in a case series of 138 covid-19 cases, wang et al. also found statistically higher ast levels in patients that required icu admission (p < 0.001). 18 in addition, there are studies in which the presence of liver alterations has been related to death. in their case series on mortality from sars-cov-2 in 82 cases, zhang et al. reported that the median of time from symptom onset until death was 15 days. with respect to transaminase elevation, there was a significant association between ast (p = 0.002), alt (p = 0.037), and the time from symptom onset until death. 19 in another report, huang et al. described the clinical characteristics of 36 patients that did not survive covid-19. the liver chemistry alterations behaved similarly to those in previous reports, with elevated alt in 13.3%, elevated ast in 58%, a decrease in albumin in 80%, an increase in total bilirubin in 13%, and an increase in d dimer in 100% of the cases. 20 finally, zhou et al. reported that in 191 patients with covid-19, 31% presented with an elevation of alt > 40 u/l. in the subgroup of patients that died, alt was elevated in 48% of the cases, vs. 24% of the patients in the group that survived (p = 0.0050). 21 in that context, the report on 1,099 patients with covid-19, conducted by guang et al., stated that ast elevation was > 40 u/l in 39% of the patients and that alt elevation was > 40 u/l in 28% of the patients with severe disease.of the patients that required icu admission, mechanical ventilation, or that died, 50% had elevated ast and 28% had elevated alt. 22 table 1 summarizes the characteristics of liver chemistry alterations and their outcomes.due to the problem of access to biopsy or autopsy reports, the histopathologic findings of this new disease are not yet completely defined. a case report by xu et al. 23 presented the post-mortem biopsy results of a 50-year-old man who died from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). with respect to the liver biopsies, there was microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal inflammatory activity. nevertheless, it was not completely certain if the liver injury was due to sars-cov-2 or to drug-induced liver injury (dili). the latter diagnostic probability is sustained by the fact that numerous drugs with great hepatotoxic potential, such as remdesivir, tocilizumab, chloroquine, and statins, are empirically used in some cases to treat severe sars-cov-2, all of which can make the j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f coronavirus patient prone to developing dili. 12 there was also no information in the case report about any comorbidities, to know if the patient could have been at risk due to a pre-existing liver disease. all of this leads to the hypothesis that elevated aminotransferases may be the result of a direct effect on the hepatocyte mediated by the virus, or of a liver injury mediated by immune and inflammatory activation associated with the infection. patients with cirrhosis of the liver (cl) are immunocompromised and more susceptible to developing spontaneous bacterial infections, some of which are due to uncommon pathogens, reflected in a higher mortality rate close to 30%. 26 patients with cl, especially in the decompensated stage, are susceptible to the development of those infections, whose prevalence can increase to 44%. 27 thus, cl is a state of immune dysfunction that encompasses immunodeficiency and systemic inflammation, exhibiting at least two known phenotypes of immune dysfunction in cirrhosis: the proinflammatory and the immunodeficient. they are characterized by the differences in cytokine activity, phagocyte activity, and hla expression, among others, that present throughout the pathophysiologic stages from compensated stages to decompensated stages, and up to acute-on-chronic liver failure (aclf). 28 said immunodeficiency also results in a reduced synthesis of pattern recognition receptors (prrs). 29 different classes of germline-encoded prrs recognize invasive pathogens and monitor the extracellular and intracellular compartments of host cells to detect signs of invasion by microorganisms. 30 the liver is the primary source of prrs (e.g., c-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide throughout history, there have been outbreaks and epidemics of viral diseases, especially respiratory diseases. the most recent is the covid-19 pandemic.patients with chronic liver disease (cld) present with multifactorial immune dysfunction. [33] [34] due to the fact that the infection site affects outcome in patients with cld, acute respiratory diseases acquire great importance because they produce an almost 40-fold increase in the hospitalization rate, compared with the general population. 34 they also generate a 2.95-fold increase in 30-day mortality in the community setting and up to an 11-fold increase in the hospital setting, the highest among isolated infectious complications. 33 the prevalence of pneumonia and influenza reported in 2009 in the united states was 0.38% and 0.027%, respectively. 34 as expected, patients with a higher grade of decompensation have a higher mortality rate in those types of events and associated factors are inadequate antibiotic use, bacteremia, leukocyte count, total bilirubin, more j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f advanced age, and alcoholic disease etiology, as well as the development of organ failure and aclf. 33 models developed during community outbreaks of influenzalike disease indicate an increase in morbidity and mortality in patients with cld, mainly related to organ failure and complications associated with liver disease, such as gastrointestinal bleeding. 35 patients with cld are prone to developing respiratory failure due to numerous causes. they can also present with disease modifiers that worsen its natural history, such as smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malnutrition, muscle deconditioning and wasting, hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathy, multiple transfusions, etc. in addition, ascites directly affects pulmonary and respiratory mechanics by increasing the intra-abdominal pressure, and hepatic encephalopathy increases the risk for micro-aspirations and ineffective cough. 36 thus, up to 70% of patients with cld can present with arterial hypoxemia. an assisted ventilation event in patients with cirrhosis, especially in the context of ards, has a mortality rate of 59% to 100% in nontransplant hospitals. 36 the mortality rate in patients with cld in icus is 46-90%. in the context of ards, that outcome appears to be associated more with the development of extrapulmonary the accumulated mortality rate after any infection in patients with cirrhosis is 43.5%, whereas the mortality rate with no infection is only 13.6%. 39 furthermore, short-term and long-term outcomes that occur after an acute respiratory failure event must be added, especially if mechanical ventilation is required, and they are generally worse than outcomes in cirrhotic patients without those conditions. 40the first epidemiologic reports characterizing patients with covid-19 came out of china. one of those reports provided data from 1,099 patients, 23 of whom had chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. 22 the probability of having presented with hbv was greater in the patients with severe covid-19 disease than in the nonsevere cases. 41 in another report from wuhan, china, on a total of 138 patients, four of them presented with cld but did not require icu admission. the most current experience at the renmin hospital of the university of wuhan in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis provided data on 111 patients. their mean age was 58.7 years, 82 were outpatients, and 29 were inpatients. 42 in the most recent report from lombardy, italy, on 1,591 critically ill patients, 3% of them had cld. 43 and psychologic support are of vast importance to prevent both treatment interruption and the relapse into alcohol consumption by patients with alcoholrelated cld. patients must be made aware that they have to keep abreast of changes in the recommendations and social policies and be instructed not to take substances or medications that have not been prescribed by their physician, including supplements or alternative products, as measures of "prevention" or to "strengthen the immune system" etc. how long the pandemic will last is not known, therefore an essential recommendation is that the influenza vaccination regimen in patients with cld be up to date.the standard of medical care for patients that are hospitalized due to causes other than covid-19 remains the same, with certain recommendations as to the selection of emergency or elective procedures, outlined in table 2. likewise, despite the fact that there is no standardized treatment for covid-19 management in patients with severe disease, the indications for liver health summarized in table   3 should be taken into account.according to the information reported in the international medical literature, hepatic manifestations of sars-cov-2 are common and the more severe alterations are j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f associated with poor outcome. severe cases are beginning to present in mexico, underlining the importance of being aware of hepatic manifestations in the general population, so that cases potentially requiring opportune hospitalization can be recognized. on the other hand, covid-19 infection in patients with pre-existing cld implies a greater risk and probability of liver dysfunction, and so healthcare professionals in charge of those patients are recommended to be alert regarding the development of potential complications. there may be questions as to the usefulness of the strategies proposed herein, but when dealing with an emerging pathology of the current magnitude it is impossible to provide recommendations that have been proven 100%. the disease, its behavior, and the data reported over the past few months have been dynamic, and thus should not be considered definitive or unalterable. for the benefit of our patients with cirrhosis of the liver, we must continuously be updating our information. it is also important to recognize that more studies on different populations are needed to have a complete understanding of the morbidity and mortality associated with sars-cov-2 in the cirrhotic patient. based upon a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction assay, performed either by the georgia department of public health, a referral laboratory, or the hospital-based clinical laboratory. during the study period, icu capacity enabled the timely admission of all patients requiring critical care to a covid-icu. further, all patients admitted to a covid-icu were cared for by a traditional icu care team led by a critical care-trained attending physician with standard (i.e., pre-covid) icu staffing ratios. there were no critical shortages in medications, ventilators, dialysis machines, or other critical care equipment. patient data, including sociodemographic information, clinical data, and laboratory data, were obtained from the electronic medical record.data were abstracted through may 7, 2020. data were analyzed using a chi-square or wilcoxon rank-sum test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively, with a two-sided p value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant (stata version 12.1; statacorp llc, college station, tx). this study was approved by the emory university institutional review board.from march 6, 2020, to april 17, 2020, 217 critically ill adults with covid-19 infection were admitted to the icu (fig. 1a) initial icu clinical findings, critical care interventions, and outcomes are summarized in table 2 . at admission to the icu, the median sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score was 7 (iqr, 5-11), the median d-dimer was 1,731 ng/ml (iqr, 934-6,948 ng/ml; upper limit of normal 298 ng/ml), and the median c-reactive protein was 190 mg/l (iqr, 126-262 mg/l; upper limit of normal 10 mg/l). the median initial pao 2 /fio 2 ratio was 132 (iqr, 100-178).there were 165 patients (76.0%) who received invasive mechanical ventilation. the median static lung compliance on the first day of intubation was 34 ml/cm h 2 o (iqr, 28-46 ml/ cm h 2 o). a total of 143 patients (65.9%) required vasopressor support for shock and 63 (29.0%) required renal replacement therapy, either in the form of continuous renal replacement therapy or intermittent hemodialysis. use of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators was relatively uncommon (22 [10.1%]) and four patients (1.8%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. overall, 114 patients (52.5%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 49 patients (22.6%) were enrolled in the national institutes of health-funded adaptive clinical treatment trial (actt) of remdesivir (clinicaltrials. gov nct04280705).among the 217 patients in the cohort, 147 (67.7%) have been transferred alive from the icu, 62 died (28.6%) in the icu (five additional deaths occurred among patients transferred to the floor), and 8 (3.7%) remain in the icu, all of whom are still mechanically ventilated (fig. 1a) . three of the patients transferred from the icu went directly to a long-term acute care facility while still receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. the median icu length of stay for patients still in the icu is 32 days (iqr, 28-41 d). among patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation, icu mortality is 33.9% (56/165) and hospital mortality is 35.7% (59/165) (fig. 1b) .the median age of patients who died was significantly older than for those who survived (71 yr [iqr, 64-78 yr] vs 61 yr [iqr, 52-69 yr]; p < 0.001) ( table 1 ). there was no difference in survival between sexes, but patients who died were less likely to be morbidly obese. although patients of asian race did have higher mortality, there were only seven asian patients in the cohort. patients with either chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or higher) or end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis also had higher mortality.patients who died had a higher sofa score on icu admission (median, 10; iqr, 7-13) than those who survived (median, 7; iqr, 4-10; p < 0.001) ( table 2 ). median d-dimer values were more than two times higher in those who died than those who survived (3,451 [iqr, 1,401-19,468] vs 1,570 [iqr, 905-4,261]; p 0.005). similarly, the initial c-reactive protein and pao 2 /fio 2 ratios were significantly worse in patients who died in the icu (p 0.045 and < 0.001, respectively). compared to those who survived, patients who died in the icu were more likely to have respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (90.3% vs 68.7%; p < 0.001), shock requiring vasopressors (90.3% vs 53.7%; p <0.001), renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (53.2% vs 18.4%; p <0.001), and receive inhaled vasodilators (19.3% vs 6.1%; p < 0.001).overall, mortality among patients who received vasopressors was 39.2% (56/143), while 33 of 63 patients (52.4%) with renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy died. twelve of the 22 patients (54.5%) who received inhaled vasodilator for refractory hypoxemia died. among the 62 patients who died in the icu, including three patients who had an advance directive not to be intubated, the median time from icu admission to death was 9 days (iqr, 5-14 d).our early experience with this large cohort of critically ill patients with covid-19 demonstrates a mortality rate of 30.9% overall, which is substantially lower than the 50-97% reported in the published literature to date (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . additionally, the 35.7% mortality for the approximately three-quarters of patients in our cohort who required mechanical ventilation is also markedly lower than previous reports. these data indicate that a majority of critically ill patients with covid-19can have good clinical outcomes and support the ongoing use of mechanical ventilation for patients with acute respiratory failure.in some of the earliest reports of covid-19 from wuhan, mortality rates among those admitted to icus ranged from 52% to 62% and increased to 86-97% among those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (5, 6, 15, 16) . in more recent data from the united kingdom, 67% of those who had received mechanical ventilation died, as compared with 22% of patients intubated with viral pneumonia in the preceding 3 years (3). early reports of smaller cohorts from seattle, where some of the first covid-19 outbreaks occurred in the united states, indicated that 50-67% of patients admitted to the icu and 71-75% of those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation died (1, 2) . a recently published report from new york found 24.5% mortality among those who required mechanical ventilation, but with 72.2% of patients still admitted to the hospital (4) .taken together, these reports have raised concerns that survival among those receiving mechanical ventilation is exceedingly poor (11) (12) (13) (14) . in contrast to the majority of prior reports, our data provide evidence that mortality rates in covid-19 can be comparable to those seen with ards and other infectious pneumonias (7) (8) (9) (10) .in our cohort, mortality was associated with older age, with 42.5% mortality in those age 65 and above as compared with 11.3% in those under age 55. mortality was also associated with severity of illness on arrival to the icu and need for icu interventions including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, renal replacement therapy, and inhaled vasodilators. approximately half of our cohort received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and nearly onequarter received at least one dose of a study drug as part of the actt trial (remdesivir vs placebo), but there was no difference in survival for either of those groups. finally, although eight patients (3.7%) are still admitted to the icu at the time of this report, 131 (60.4%) have been discharged from the hospital.several local and regional considerations may have influenced the observed outcomes. first, the arrival and peak of the covid-19 pandemic in georgia were later than in many of the regions from earlier reports. this delay provided time to establish organizational structures, acquire equipment, prepare personnel, create consensus-driven clinical protocols, and align resources across a large healthcare system. in addition, while patient volumes did merit the redesignation of several specialty icus as covid-icus, all critically ill patients with covid-19 were admitted to preexisting icus and cared for by critical care teams with experience managing acute respiratory failure and at standard patient-to-provider ratios. further, while an analysis of the impact of clinical interventions on survival is beyond the scope of this brief report, our internal in a cohort of critically ill adults with covid-19, we report an early mortality rate of 30.9% overall and 35.7% for patients who received mechanical ventilation. although there may be a several factors underlying these findings, these results suggest that most patients with acute respiratory failure from covid-19 may recover, even with severe disease requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. coronavirus infection outbreaks have occurred frequently in the last two decades and have led to significant mortality. despite the focus on reducing mortality by preventing the spread of the virus, patients have died due to several other complications of the illness. the understanding of pathological mechanisms and their implications is continuously evolving. a number of symptoms occur in these patients due to the involvement of various endocrine glands. these clinical presentations went largely unnoticed during the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in [2002] [2003] . a few of these derangements continued during the convalescence phase and sometimes occurred after recovery. similar pathological and biochemical changes are being reported with the novel coronavirus disease outbreak in 2020. in this review, we focus on these endocrine changes that have been reported in both sars coronavirus and sars coronavirus-2. as we battle the pandemic, it becomes imperative to address these underlying endocrine disturbances that are contributing towards or predicting mortality of these patients.on 31 december 2019, the who office in china was informed of a few cases of pneumonia of unknown cause originating from the city of wuhan, hubei in china. 1 over the next 3 months, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) illness commonly called covid-19 has affected more than four million people globally with over 1.4 million cases in the usa itself, making it the new epicentre of the illness followed by much of western europe. the mortality rates from different parts of the world show vast differences but studies have consistently shown that the presence of comorbidities, specially type 2 diabetes mellitus significantly increases mortality in patients with sars-cov-2 with an or of 2.85. [2] [3] [4] [5] a study from china also showed that patients in the intensive care unit with sars-cov-2 infection were more likely to have underlying diabetes (22.2% vs 5.9%) than others. 6 certain forms of hypophysitis, thyroiditis and adrenalitis have viral aetiologies. changes in endocrine functions observed during the previous coronavirus outbreak with sars-cov, led to considerable morbidity and were important predictors of mortality. therefore, it is imperative to know the endocrinopathic impact of sars-cov-2 illness. the purpose of this review is to highlight the available data on endocrine changes in such patients and to recapitulate the existing knowledge from previous coronavirus outbreaks for better risk stratification and management of patients with sars-cov-2 infection.all articles reporting endocrine changes in sars-cov-2 and sars-cov patients were considered. electronic database of pubmed was searched using medical subject headings (mesh) terms related to sars-cov-2, sars-cov and different hormones. since the sars-cov outbreak occurred in 2002, search results were limited to january 2002 onwards to consider articles pertaining to the outbreaks of both the viruses. a considerable number of articles were in the chinese language and were included after being translated into english. this was supplemented by handsearching reference lists for additional studies and case reports. similarly, google scholar database was handsearched. studies listing type 2 diabetes mellitus as a risk factor of sars-cov-2 and sars-cov were excluded since they did not mention any biochemical changes. articles about corticosteroid induced hyperglycaemia, audio interviews and articles detailing the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (raas) inhibitors were excluded. an initial search showed 1585 articles; finally, 17 of them were included (figure 1).coronavirus infections cause a systemic disease that injures many organs. these patients manifest many hormonal and metabolic disturbances. changes in thyroid, pancreas and adrenal glands have been reported in detail in both sars-cov and the current sars-cov-2 infections. the pathology data, clinical features, management and outcome of these endocrinopathies are highlighted below (figure 2).a detailed histopathological study on the effects of sars infection on the thyroid gland was done during the sars-cov outbreak. 7 there was extensive injury of the parafollicular cells and follicular epithelium with the destruction and exfoliation of epithelial cells into the follicle leading to its disruption. these changes were responsible for lower levels of thyroid hormones noted in clinical studies. parafollicular cells are responsible for calcitonin production and they could not be identified on h&e sections in the tissue sample from patients with sars. damage to interfollicular tissue including parafollicular cells may adversely affect calcitonin production. an interesting finding was the absence of inflammatory infiltrate and features of cellular necrosis, supporting the hypothesis of extensive apoptosis responsible for thyroid injury.the pathology data of the thyroid gland in patients with sars-cov-2 infection have been published by yao et al. they conducted minimally invasive autopsies from different organs in patients who had died of sars-cov-2 and investigated the pathological changes. 8 they reported no abnormalities in the thyroid follicular morphology but did note lymphocytic infiltration in the interstitium. none of the tissue immunohistochemistry and pcr analyses detected sars-cov-2 in the thyroid gland. these findings are at variance with those reported in sars-cov though the patient characteristics in the two studies were nearly the same. however, irrespective of pathological findings, most of the studies found a similar pattern of biochemical changes.limited data suggest that the thyroid gland and the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid (hpt) axis are directly affected in sars-cov-2 illness. a study of 274 patients with sars-cov-2 showed that thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) and free triiodothyronine (t3) concentrations were significantly lower in deceased patients (0.7 miu/ml and 2.8 pmol/l) than in recovered patients (1.4 miu/ml and 4.3 pmol/l). the difference in the thyroxine (t4) levels was not statistically significant. 9 a study by wang et al reported that serum levels of t3 and t4 in patients with sars-cov were significantly lower than those in the control group, and low t3 levels correlated with disease severity. serum t3 and t4 levels were decreased, respectively, in 94% and 46% of 48 patients with sars-cov during the acute phase and 90% and 38% during the convalescent phase of the disease. 10 the authors also noted lower levels of tsh in these patients. dysfunction of the hpt axis caused a diminished level of serum tsh in patients with sars-cov despite low serum t3 and t4. no significant difference in serum parathyroid hormone level was observed between patients with sars-cov and the control group, during the acute or convalescent phases of the illness.changes in thyroid hormone levels may persist after clinical recovery. leow et al studied sars-cov survivors for hormonal derangements 3 months after recovery and noted that 6.7% of the patients had developed biochemical hypothyroidism. 11 the majority of these patients (75%) had a central aetiology and only 25% developed primary hypothyroidism with positive antibodies and continued to receive thyroid hormone replacement at the end of the study. on follow-up, changes in the thyroid profile of the patients with central hypothyroidism had normalised. central hypocortisolism was also present in 66% of patients who had central hypothyroidism. the authors suggested a dysfunctional hpt axis as evidenced by the results of thyroid hormones and the coexistence of central hypocortisolism.these studies suggest for the monitoring of thyroid function tests during acute illness as well as during convalescence of sars-cov-2 with the possibility of replacement therapy as indicated. there were reports of recovery of thyroid function in 3-6 months in sars-cov patients, implying reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic. 11many viruses, such as enteroviruses, coxsackie b virus, 12 retroviruses, rubella, mumps, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr and varicella zoster virus have been implicated in the development of diabetes mellitus in humans. 13 review coronavirus has also been reported to cause diabetes in animal and human studies. in a case report of a foal, it was suggested that the pancreas could have had direct viral damage due to coronavirus leading to diarrhoea and transient diabetes mellitus simultaneously. 14 it has been demonstrated that coronaviruses enter human lungs, pancreas and other tissues by interacting with the ace2 receptor. the expression of ace2 is much stronger in pancreatic endocrine tissue compared with the exocrine tissue. 15 the extent of tissue damage by sars-cov is a direct function of the level of expression of tissue ace2. thus, sars-cov viruses may damage pancreatic islets and cause acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus but not acute pancreatitis.the pancreatic biopsy findings in sars-cov-2 patients have been identical to the previous studies in sars-cov patients. yao et al reported no obvious abnormalities in the epithelial cells in the exocrine pancreas; however, degeneration of a few islet cells was noted. 8 it was observed that patients with mild sars-cov who did not receive glucocorticoid medications during the disease course had a higher level of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) on the first day of hospitalisation than those who had non-sars pneumonia. newonset diabetes developed in 51% of sars-cov patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment during illness. 15 hyperglycaemia was an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in sars-cov patients with and without a history of diabetes mellitus. 4 yang et al demonstrated that before steroid treatment, the mean fpg level was significantly higher in sars-cov patients (deceased vs survivors vs non-sars pneumonia group: 9.7±5.2 vs 6.5±3.0 vs 5.1±1.0 mmol/l, p<0.01). hyperglycaemia (fpg≥7.0 mmol/l) before steroid treatment was significantly associated with death (or 3.3) after adjustment for age and gender. there was an incremental rise in mortality with increasing fpg. another interesting association noted was between hypoxaemia and higher fpg levels. 4 among patients with no known history of diabetes and before the commencement of steroid therapy, those who had hypoxaemia (arterial oxygen saturation <93%) had higher fpg levels than those who did not have hypoxia in both the survivor (8.7±4.9 vs 6.3±2.1 mmol/l) and deceased (9.8±4.8 vs 7.2±1.5 mmol/l) groups. it was estimated that for every 1.0 mmol/l increase in fpg, the hr increased by 1.08-fold for death and 1.07-fold for hypoxia morbidity. in both survivors and deceased patients, irrespective of steroid dosage, elevated fpg values started falling in the third week indicating gradual recovery of islet cell function.about half a billion people are currently living with diabetes worldwide. patients with diabetes had a poorer outcome in previous epidemics of sars-cov and h1n1 epidemics. 16 17 the clinical course of sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes and without other comorbidities was recently reported by guo et al from wuhan, china. 18 patients with diabetes may present with milder symptoms initially, but they were at higher risk of rapid progression to severe pneumonia, uncontrolled cytokine storm and hypercoagulable state contributing to a poorer prognosis. interleukin-6 (il-6) level was found to be higher in sars-cov-2 cases with diabetes than those without diabetes. wang et al hypothesised that sars-cov-2 infection in patients with diabetes might trigger stress condition and increase secretion of hyperglycaemic hormones, such as glucocorticoid and catecholamines, resulting in elevated blood glucose, abnormal glucose variability and diabetic complications in turn leading to higher mortality and morbidity rates in these patients. 19 a study of 99 sars-cov-2 patients demonstrated that 52% of patients had elevated blood glucose with a mean glucose value of 7.4 mmol/l. 20 wu et al 21 showed that sars-cov-2 patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) had higher glucose levels (7.4 vs 5.4 mmol/l) compared with patients who did not develop ards (hr 1.13) . similarly, in sars-cov-2 patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, increased glucose level was an independent risk factor for severe/critical illness on multivariate analysis (or 2.42). 22 sars-cov-2 patients with diabetes are at high risk of progressing rapidly with ards and septic shock. ma et al recommended fpg of 4.4-6.1 mmol/l, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2 h pg) 6.1-7.8 mmol/l in mild cases and fpg 7.8-10.0 mmol/l, 2 h pg 7.8-13.9 mmol/l for critically ill patients of sars-cov-2. 23 to sum up, sars-cov infections damage islet cells causing acute temporary diabetes. high fpg and associated metabolic changes lead to increased morbidity and mortality in these patients. in addition, pre-existing diabetes may be considered a risk factor for poorer outcomes of sars-cov-2 pneumonia. intensive blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy to obtain optimal metabolic control may improve the outcome of these patients. tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against il-6 may have a role in patients with diabetes to control overexpressed il-6. it is being used off-label currently and a randomised controlled trial is testing its utility. 24 the european society of endocrinology statement advises patients with diabetes to avoid physician office visits and seek telephonic/electronic consultations for optimal control of blood sugar. they need to get an early referral to emergency services in case of possible symptoms of sars-cov-2. 25the histological changes in adrenal glands of the patients dying from sars-cov were described by ding et al from postmortem biopsy samples. 26 they noted that the adrenal medulla had been infiltrated by mainly the monocytes and lymphocytes. another interesting finding was the focal necrosis of the gland. in addition, vasculitis of the small veins of the adrenal medulla was present. no similar studies have been conducted in sars-cov-2 patients until date. however, there are reasons to believe that similar adrenal gland changes could occur given the similarity of the viral structure and mechanism of entry into human host cells.sars-cov genome sequences have been detected in the cytoplasm of numerous neurons in the hypothalamus and cortex. 27 it might induce either hypophysitis or directly affect the hypothalamus leading to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. leow et al 11 studied hypocortisolism in patients who had recovered from sars-cov. patients with an intact hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (hpa) axis at the time of acquiring sars-cov were included in the study. these patients also had symptoms like lethargy, malaise, lassitude, fatigue, weakness, orthostatic dizziness, anorexia, apathy, anxiety and depression after recovery. three months after recovery, 39·3% of patients had hypocortisolism, of which 83·3% had central hypocortisolism as depicted by low adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) levels. it was interesting to note that the majority of these patients had not received any systemic glucocorticoids as part of the treatment for sars ruling out the possibility of hpa axis suppression by exogenous corticosteroid use. the hypocortisolism was, however, transient and resolved in 62·5% of patients within a year with an average duration of 5·9±3·1 months. these patients also reported resolution of symptoms including orthostatic hypotension in comparison to the start of the study. six patients (25%) continued with residual hypocortisolism at 1-year follow-up and one of them still required hydrocortisone replacement. findings from sars-cov and sars-cov-2 patients suggest for actively monitoring biochemical changes like serum cortisol and acth. shall these biochemical changes go unnoticed; it may complicate post-sars recovery. symptomatic patients with orthostatic hypotension may require physiological doses of hydrocortisone replacement until hpa axis recovery. in addition, patients with adrenal insufficiency and cushing's syndrome are at increased risk of sars-cov-2 infection and should adhere to enhanced preventive steps.changes in the cells of anterior pituitary were noted in biopsy samples of sars-cov patients. 28 on immunohistochemical staining, the number of somatotrophs, thyrotrophs and corticotrophs was reduced while the number of lactotrophs and gonadotrophs was significantly increased. these findings correlated with biochemical abnormalities of increased prolactin, luteinising hormone and follicle stimulating hormone in sars-cov reported earlier in chinese literature.seasonal and the h1n1 influenza a virus (h1n1) pandemic have been associated with increased severity and greater risk of morbidity and mortality in obese persons compared with normal weight persons. being overweight and obesity, both negatively impact cellular immune response to h1n1 influenza. 29 obesity is associated with several chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnoea and surfactant dysfunction in the lungs which may increase the risk of complications of sars-cov-2. the intensive care management of patients with severe obesity is always very challenging and difficult. 30 it is likely that obesity is an independent risk factor for severe sars-cov-2 illness and should be further investigated.early studies have linked the increased mortality rates in sars-cov-2 patients with the presence of diabetes mellitus. increased glucose levels have been associated with the development of ards and worsening of sars-cov-2 illness requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. hyperglycaemia can be a useful predictor to assess patients and triage them effectively to provide early management strategies. strict glucose management is required in such patients to reduce mortality. central hypothyroidism and central hypocortisolism seem to occur commonly in patients infected with coronavirus. these changes are usually transient and occur during the illness or after recovery. this crucial information calls for reassessment of survivors of the current pandemic, and identifying these changes early with prompt management can prevent further complications. prospective randomised clinical trials, cohort studies andage or gender of the deceased patient was stated. both official documents and press conferences were considered.the following data were abstracted: gender, age, time from symptom onset to hospital admission, time from hospital admission to death, medical history and first symptoms.for each of the measure studied, a confidence interval for the central tendency was calculated (eg, proportion for male, mean for age). the computation was done in a spreadsheet, microsoft office excel version 2016. a regression model was estimated by regressing the time from hospital admission to death on other variables. the computation was done with the software r and the adjusted r 2 was used for the model selection criterion. moreover, different functional forms were attempted to ensure normally distributed residuals free from autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity.forty-six fatal cases were identified and included in the study including 39 cases in hubei, 5-7 one in chongqing, 8 two in henan, 9 two in heilongjiang, 10 one in hebei 11 and one in sichuan. 12 of the seven cases outside hubei, three had a travel history to wuhan. demographic and common clinical characteristics are illustrated in table 1 .the average age was 70.6 years (n = 45, 95% ci 52.0-80.5) with no significant difference between men and women (t test p = .80).eighty-four percent of all deceased patients were of age 60 or above.men accounted for 67.4% (95% ci 52.0%-80.5%) of all deceased patients.while the time from first symptom onset to hospital admission was normally distributed with mean 6.2 days, the time from hospital admission to death was log-normally distributed (with mean 11 days and median 5 days), as suggested by the jarque-bera normality test (p = .56) on the log-transformed data. therefore, the log-transformed time from hospital admission to death was regressed in the model.based on the adjusted r 2 , the time from symptom onset to hospital admission, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities, and age were selected as the independent variables (table 2 ). with the exception of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities, all other variables are significant at 5% level. the signs of the coefficients are reasonable as the time from hospitalisation to death was inversely related to age and the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation.the statistical significance of time from symptom onset to hospital suggests the need of timely hospitalisation. in fact, the coefficient of time from symptom onset to hospital admission means that, for any two identical patients who will eventually expire with hospital admission 1 day apart, the expected time from hospital admission to death of the patient with later hospital admission is 8.5% shorter than that of the other patient, all else being equal.although a patient was admitted to the hospital for palpitation on 26 november 2019, it is important to note that palpitation was not a common symptom of covid-19 infection. myocardial injury is associated with higher mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a meta-analysisin december 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) broke out in wuhan, china, and has spread widely all over the world, reaching the pandemic level. [1] according to the latest who report, 693,224 cases of covid-19 were confirmed globally as of march 30, 2020, with more than 33,000 deaths. [2] because covid-19 is highly contagious and harmful, it is crucial to determine the predictors of severe infection and death for risk stratification and guiding clinical treatment and intervention.  respiratory symptoms are the most prevalent manifestations of covid-19. however, studies have shown that acute cardiac injury is a common complication in covid-19 patients. [3, 4] indeed, a study in the early stage of the disease outbreak showed that 12% of 41 patients diagnosed with covid-19 had acute myocardial injury, which was characterized by a significant increase in the level of hypersensitive troponin i (hs-ctni). [5] the heart autopsy results of three covid-19 cases revealed pathological changes of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, partial cardiomyocyte degeneration and necrosis, mild interstitial congestion and edema, accompanied by a small number of lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophil infiltration. [6] additionally, a meta-analysis showed that hs-ctni was significantly increased in patients with severe covid-19 compared with mild forms. [7] therefore, myocardial injury is likely to be an important prognostic factor for covid-19. here, we summarize the current literature to explore the correlation between myocardial injury and mortality in patients with covid-19.pubmed, the web of science, medrxiv and covid-19 academic research communication platforms (articles in chinese, http://medjournals.cn/2019ncp/index.do) were * the authors contributed equally to this manuscript. # correspondence to: yangyn5126@163.com used to search articles published until march 30, 2020 without language restriction application. the following keywords were used: ("coronavirus disease 2019" or "covid-19" or "novel coronavirus pneumonia" or "2019-ncov" or "sars-cov-2") and ("heart injury" or "cardiac injury" or "myocardial injury") and ("death" or "mortality" or "nonsurvivor" or "deceased") alone and in combination. the title, abstract and full text of all documents identified using the search criteria were assessed, and those reporting the mortality rate in covid-19 patients with and without myocardial injury were included in this meta-analysis. the reference lists of all studies were also analyzed to identify additional eligible studies.a meta-analysis was performed on retrievable data, including estimation of the odds ratio (or) and its 95% confidence interval (ci) of mortality in patients with or without myocardial injury. all statistical analyses were conducted with revman 5.3 software (chichester, the uk centre, the cochrane collaboration). the mantel-haenszel (statistical method) and fixed effect (analysis model) models were employed to assess outcomes. forest plots were utilized to visually illustrate effect estimates of the included studies. funnel plots were used to examine publication bias. we used the newcastle-ottawa scale (nos) to further evaluate the quality of the observational studies, with nos score > 7 considered good quality. [8] overall, 134 studies were originally detected based on our electronic and reference search; after screening by title, abstract and full text, 125 studies were excluded [as not specifically related to covid-19 (n = 52), review articles (n = 18), did not provide relevant data (n = 20), editorials (n = 21), and compared patients by severity but not by mortality (n = 14)]. ultimately, 9 studies involving a total of 1470 patients were enrolled. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] the characteristics of the included studies are described in table 1 , and the treatment and clinical outcome of the patients are described in table 2 . all articles included in the meta-analysis had high quality according to the nos. the mortality rate with or without myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 are depicted in figure 1a . in our study, the overall mortality rate was 23.5%. the mortality rate of patients without myocardial injury was considerably lower than that of patients with myocardial injury (11.2% vs. 67.1%, p < 0.001), and myocardial injury was significantly associated with increased mortality in patients with covid-19 (or = 13.68, 95% ci: 9.81-19.08, p < 0.001). heterogeneity among the studies was borderline significant (i 2 = 52%, p = 0.03). a funnel plot showed symmetry, indicating a low risk of publication bias ( figure 1b) .sars-cov-2 causes myocardial injury through direct and indirect pathogenic pathways. single-cell data analysis identified that human myocardial cells express angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ace2) and that higher expression is present in patients with heart failure. [18] sars-cov-2 may invade cells by binding to ace2, causing direct damage to cardiomyocytes. however, the autopsy results of covid-19 cases failed to detect sars-cov-2 virus components in myocardial tissue by electron microscope observation, immunohistochemical staining or pcr. [6] sars-cov-2 infection may also cause myocardial injury through overactivetion of the immune system, with the release of a large number of cytokines and cytokine storms. [19, 20] in addition, pulmonary infection-induced hypoxemia, respiratory failure and shock might lead to insufficient myocardial oxygen supply; after infection, the burden of the heart increases, and the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand leads to myocardial injury. [21] overall, more studies are necessary to clarify the mechanism of sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injury.the overall mortality rate was 23.5% in our meta-analysis, which is much higher than the value of 2.3% of 44,672 confirmed cases reported in the study of the chinese centers for disease control and prevention. [22] a possible reason is that these involved studies included a high proportion of critically ill patients. this large sample size report also showed that the case fatality rate was associated with disease severity, as all death cases were among critical patients. our meta-analysis showed that covid-19 patients with myocardial injury have a higher mortality rate. a previous meta-analysis also reported a significant increase in ctni in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection, indicating that myocardial injury might be related to covid-19 severity. [7] therefore, the existence of myocardial injury should be regarded as an important index in the risk stratification of disease severity and death for covid-19. continuous monitoring of myocardial injury markers and cardiac function during hospitalization should be strengthened. for patients with myocardial injury, we believe that doctors should conduct comprehensive treatment, including correcting hypoxemia and improving myocardial oxygen supplementation, applying immunoglobulins to inhibit the excessive immune response, improving myocardial energy metabolism, and maintaining water-electrolyte balance, to improve the prognosis of covid-19 patients.http://www.jgc301.com; jgc@jgc301.com | journal of geriatric cardiology in december 2019 a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were later confirmed to be infected with a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), in wuhan, hubei province, china [1, 2] . the clinical spectrum of sars-cov-2 infection appeared to be wide, ranging from asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe or even fatal in some cases. to accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes of infections caused by sars-cov-2 [3à5], the who later introduced a rather unspecific name covid-19 (coronavirus disease 19) to denote this disease.the rapid emergence of covid-19 in wuhan city, hubei province, china, has resulted in thousands of deaths [6] . recently, the covid-19 spread rapidly around the world and caused the death of hundreds of thousands of patients [7] . at present, there are no effective therapies or vaccines for covid-19. it was reported that the death was mainly in severe patients, and many infected patients presented mild flu-like symptoms and quickly recover [5] . however, the differences in clinical characteristics between severe and non-severe cases were little reported [8, 9] . in particular, the comparison of clinical characteristics between survivors and non-survivors of severe patients and risk factors for survival have not been reported.in this study, we aimed to identify risk factors for mortality of severe patients and establish a risk model to predict mortality, so that clinicians can effectively consider medical resources of patients with different risks.this retrospective cohort study included three institutions: zhongnan hospital of wuhan university, no. 7 hospital of wuhan and leishenshan hospital (wuhan, china). zhongnan hospital is responsible for the treatments for covid-19 assigned by the government. no. 7 hospital of wuhan is one of the designated hospitals for the hospitalization of patients with covid-19 and has been entrusted by zhongnan hospital of wuhan university since january 2020. leishenshan hospital was a hospital specially built to treat patients with covid-19 and was taken over by the zhongnna hospital of wuhan university. all consecutive patients with confirmed covid-19 according to who interim guidance from january 1 to march 27, 2020 were enrolled in present study [10] . patients absent of or with negative sars-cov-2 test results were excluded from this study. all patients involved in this study were living in wuhan during the outbreak period of covid-19. the clinical outcomes such as discharges or mortality were monitored up to march 31, 2020 , the final date of follow-up, and all patients with covid-19 have experienced a definite outcome. this study was conducted according to the principles of helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of zhongnan hospital of wuhan university (no. 2020074).epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics, treatment and outcomes data were obtained from electronic medical records with standardized data collection forms. the data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians. covid-19 was defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptaseàpolymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens [3] . the targeted region of rt-pcr for viral rna detection included open reading frame 1ab (orf1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (n). target 1 (orf1ab): forward primer ccctgtgggttttacacttaa; reverse primer acgattgtgcatcagctga; and the probe 5'-vic-ccgtctgcggtatgtggaaaggttatgg-bhq1-3'. target 2 (n): forward primer ggggaacttctcctgctagaat; reverse primer cagacattttgctctcaagctg; and the probe 5'-fam-ttgctgctgcttgacagatt-tamra-3'. radiologic assessments included chest radiography or computed tomography (ct). laboratory examinations consisted of complete blood count, serum biochemical tests (including liver and renal function, creatine kinase mb isoenzyme and electrolytes), coagulation profile, c-reactive protein (crp) and procalcitonin (pct). anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies (igg and igm) were also tracked. igm and igg antibodies were measured with covid-19 igm/igg chemiluminescence test kit (shenzhen yahuilong biotechnology co., ltd., china). tests were performed on iflash 3000 automated analyzer. the durations from illness onset to complications, hospital admission, discharged or death were recorded. the criteria for discharge were absence of fever for at least 3 days, substantial improvement in both lungs in chest ct, clinical remission of respiratory symptoms, and two throat-swab samples negative for sars-cov-2 rna obtained at least 24 h apart.fever was defined as axillary temperature of 37¢3°c or higher. septic shock was defined according to the 2016 third international consensus definition [3] . acute kidney injury (aki) was identified according to the kidney disease: improving global outcomes definition [11, 12] . acute liver injury (ali) was defined if liver enzymes or bilirubin were more than twice the upper limit of normal [13, 14] . acute myocardial injury (ami) was defined if the serum levels ofevidence before this studywe searched pubmed on march 11, 2020, for articles that documented the risk factors of mortality and scoring system to predict in-hospital death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) , resulting from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), using the search terms ("novel coronavirus" or "sars-cov-2" or "covid-19") and ("death" or "mortality") and ("model" or "scoring system") with no language or time restrictions. older age, higher sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score, d-dimer levels, comorbidities, lymphocytopenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase, high-sensitive cardiac troponin i were reported to be associated with mortality. however, no published works were found to establish a scoring system to predict in-hospital deaths for patients with severe covid-19.in this retrospective cohort study from three hospitals in wuhan, china, we found that old age, coronary heart disease condition, percentage of lymphocytes <8%, procalcitonin>0¢15 ng/ml and d-dimer >0¢5 ug/ml were independent risk factors for mortality. based on the above variables, a scoring system of covid-19 (css) was established to divide patients into low-risk and highrisk groups. this model displayed good discrimination (auc=0¢919) and calibration (p=0¢264). complications in lowrisk and high-risk groups were significantly different (p<0¢05). use of corticosteroids in low-risk groups increased hospital stays by 4¢5 days (p=0¢036) and durations of disease by 7¢5 days (p=0¢012) compared with no corticosteroids.old age, coronary heart disease condition, lymphopenia, elevated procalcitonin and d-dimer were independently related to mortality. css was useful for predicting in-hospital mortality and complications, and it could help clinicians to identify highrisk patients with poor outcomes. cardiac biomarkers were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and echocardiography [3] . coagulopathy was defined as a 3-s extension of prothrombin time or a 5-s extension of activated partial thromboplastin time [8] . the illness severity of covid-19 was defined according to the chinese management guideline for covid-19 (version 7¢0) [15] . covid-19 patients are stratified as follows: mild (i.e., mild clinical symptoms without imaging feature of pneumonia), ordinary (i.e., clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, with imaging feature of pneumonia), severe (i.e., dyspnea, respiratory frequency 30/min, blood oxygen saturation 93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% within 24 to 48 h), and critical ill cases (i.e., respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure). in this analysis, severe cases included the severe and critical ill classification in the 7th edition. survival time was defined as from illness onset to death.normality of distribution of continuous variables was tested by the kolmogorovàsmirnov test. we used the chi-square test or fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t or mannàwhitney u test for continuous variables to compare differences between survivors and non-survivors by ibm spss statistics software, version 25¢0. the cut-off value of continuous variables was defined based on the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve with optimal sensitivity and specificity. in training cohort, there are few missing values for each variable, and the proportion of missing values does not exceed 10%, so multiple imputation methods were applied to supplement missing values to obtain complete data using "mice" package with r version 3¢6¢3 software. then the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) regression was performed to identify variables with non-zero coefficients using package of "glmnet". the coefficients and multivariable analyses were used to generate a prediction model. to quantify discrimination performance of the model, roc curve was measured with "rms" package in r software. by comparing observed actual data with the predicted probability of the model, calibration curves were plotted, accompanied with the hosmeràlemeshow test. cumulative risk events were estimated in training and independent validation cohort using the kaplanàmeier method in high-and lowrisk groups and the log-rank test to assess statistical significance of the difference. all reported p values were two-sided at significancelevel of 0¢05.this work was supported by the key project for anti-2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia from the ministry of science and technology, china (grant number 2020yfc0845500).in total, 2529 patients were hospitalized in zhongnan hospital, no. 7 hospital of wuhan and leishenshan hospital with covid-19. a total of 1830 cases with complete data and defined outcomes were included, among of which 452 cases (26.7%) were severe. the severe patients have relatively high mortality rates in zhongnan hospital of wuhan university (39.1%) and no. 7 hospital of wuhan (46.3%), while the mortality rate in leishenshan hospital (8.8%) is lower. therefore, 113 severe patients from zhongnan hospital and no. 7 hospital of wuhan were included as training cohort to compare the characteristics of survivors and non-survivors, while 339 from leishenshan hospital were assigned to independent validation cohort. the demographic and clinical characteristics were shown in tables 1, 2 and s1.in training cohort, there were 49 non-survivors during hospitalization. the median age of severe patients was 66 years (range: 24à96 years; interquartile ranges: 57¢5à73¢5 years), while it was 73¢0 years for the non-survivors. the number of men was more than women (table 1) . patients aged 60à75 years accounted for the largest proportion, with a proportion of 51¢3%. among the population in training cohort, 72 (63¢7%) patients had at least one underlying comorbidity, the most common of which were hypertension (44¢2%) followed by coronary heart disease (24¢8%) and diabetes (17¢7%) ( table 2 ). the coronary heart disease (chd) or diabetes had statistical differences between survivors and non-survivors. all severe covid-19 had abnormal radiologic findings on chest in present study. nineteen patients (18¢3%) had co-infection with the virus on admission, of which influenza b co-infection (7.6%) was the most common ( table 2) .for treatment, 109 (96¢5%) patients received antibiotics and 97 (85¢8%) received antiviral drugs ( table 2) . intravenous immunoglobulin use was in 24¢8%. systematic corticosteroid application accounted for 54.7% in survivors, while it was 81.6% in non-survivors (p=0¢003). the comparison of treatment, and outcomes in training cohort were shown in tables 2 and 3 . respiratory failure (41¢6%) was the most frequently observed complication, followed by ami (38¢9%), ali (25¢7%) and aki (23¢0%) ( table 3 ). the secondary infection occurred in 16¢8% patients. sepsis and acidosis all occurred in non-survivors. the frequency of complications was higher in non-survivors than survivors (all p<0¢05, table 3 ).median time from illness onset to admission was similar in survivors and non-survivors (p=0¢958) with a median duration of 7¢0 days (1¢0à41¢0) for survivors and 8¢0 days (0à30¢0) for non-survivors ( table 3 ). the median time from illness onset to discharge was 30¢0 days (range: 11¢0à67¢0; interquartile ranges: 23¢0à38¢0) for survivors, whereas the median time to death was 21¢0 days (range: 2¢0à54¢0; interquartile ranges: 15¢0à31¢5) for non-survivors (p<0¢01). the median time from illness onset to complication had no statistical differences between survivors and non-survivors (all p>0¢05, table 3 ). median time from illness onset to progression of respiratory failure was 11¢0 days, followed by secondary infection (13¢0 days), ami (14.5 days), ali (16¢0 days), aki (16¢5 days), acidosis (19¢0 days), coagulopathy (19¢0 days) and sepsis (22¢0 days) ( table 3 , fig. 1(a) ). among non-survivors, the median time from illness onset to admission, from admission to progression of complication, from complication occurred to death was shown in fig. 1 (b). the median time from coagulopathy or acidosis to death was the shortest (3 days), followed by aki, ali, ami, sepsis, respiratory failure and secondary infection.of cases from zhongnan hospital, 56 non-severe serums and 15 severe serums were tested for anti-sars-cov-2 antibodies from patients with covid-19. the igg and igm levels of severe and nonsevere patients were shown in fig. 1(c) and (d). the maximum time for antibody monitoring was up to 54 days from illness onset. antibody levels between severe and non-severe patients had no statistical differences (p=0.179 for igg, p=0.926 for igm). igg levels reached the highest during 20à30 days both in severe and non-severe covid-19 patients. in severe patients, the level of igg gradually declined after 30 days, while in non-severe patients it remained stable. the igm levels stabilized at low levels in non-severe patients, whereas it gradually increased after 30 days from the onset of symptoms in severe patients, and then declined after 50 days.in total, 52 characteristics were analyzed by lasso binary logistic regression in training cohort, and 8 candidate variables that were reliably associated with survival were selected (fig. 2) . the weight for each factor associated with infection were obtained by calculating coefficients when log(λ)=à2¢475 and λ=0¢0841 from lasso binary logistic regression model (fig. 2(a) and (b) ). the coefficients for each parameter were as follows: 0¢4565 for age, 0¢0997 for diabetes, 0¢2487 for chd, 0¢1760 for percentage of lymphocytes (lym%),<8%, 1¢371 for pct>0¢15 ng/ml, 0¢2150 for blood urea nitrogen (bun)> 7¢6 mmol/l, 0¢0815 for c reactive protein (crp) >55 mg/l and 0¢5865 39(35¢3) 11(17¢5) 28(59¢6) <0¢001 inflammatory indicators and coagulation function pct (ng/ml) for d-dimer (dd) >0¢5 ug/ml. then, by multivariable analysis, age, chd, lym%, pct and dd remained independent risk factors for mortality, and hazard ratios (hrs) of the five variables were shown in fig. 2(c) . according to multivariable analysis and coefficients of lasso binary logistic regression, a scoring system of covid-19 (css) was generated as shown in fig. 2(d) . the score distributions were as follows: age between 60 and 75 points was 1 point, and those older than 75 was 2 points, chd condition was 1 point, lym% <8% was 1 point, pct>0¢15 ng/ml was 2 points and dd>0¢5 ug/ml was 1 point. we then defined a total of 0 to 2 points as low risk, and total points more than 2 as high risk. the cut-off value between these groups was selected based on the best sensitivity/specificity ratio.the model showed great prognostic accuracy in both training cohort and independent validation cohort by using roc analysis (fig. 3(a) and (d) ). performance of this model was validated by calibration plots for the probability of death, which demonstrated good agreement between prediction and actual observation in training cohort ( fig. 3(b) ). the hosmeràlemeshow test yielded a nonsignificant statistic (p=0¢264), indicating that there was no departure from perfect fit. for illustration, the cumulative risk events were performed in training and independent validation cohorts, which showed significantly increased deaths in high-risk group compared with the low-risk group (fig. 3(c) and (f)).in low-risk group, the number of patients was 60 with 6 non-survivors, and in high-risk group, the number of patients was 53 with 43 non-survivors. the mortality rates were 10¢0% in low-risk group and 81¢1% in high-risk group (p<0¢01). there were also statistical differences in complications in low-risk and high-risk groups except for sepsis. in low-risk group, the median time from illness to death was 34¢5 days, whereas it was 21¢0 days in high-risk group (p=0¢039, fig. 4 (b)), indicating that low-risk patients had a longer survival time. for survivors, the median time from illness to discharge was 20¢0 days for low-risk group, and 22¢5 for high-risk group (p=0¢125, fig. 4(b) ). in low-risk group, 30 survivors received systemic corticosteroids treatment and 24 survivors did not, whose mean hospital durations were 23¢0 days and 18¢5 days respectively (p=0¢036, fig. 4(a) ), and the median time from illness onset to discharge was 34¢5 days and 27¢0 days (p=0¢012, fig. 4(b) ). in high-risk group, 34 non-survivors received systemic corticosteroids treatment and 9 non-survivors did not, and their median survival time were 21¢0 days and 15¢0 days respectively (p=0¢475, fig. 4(b) ). in conclusion, in low-risk group, the absence of systemic corticosteroids could shorten duration of disease by 7¢5 days and hospital duration by 4¢5 days, meanwhile, whether to use of systemic corticosteroids in high-risk group had no effect on survival.data from 20 patients with complete clinical course (including 10 severe survivors, 10 severe non-survivors) were analyzed to track scores from admission to discharge or death (fig. 5(a) ). among survivors, scores gradually decreased during hospitalization until discharge, whereas scores gradually increased until death in nonsurvivors. meanwhile, the last laboratory findings with lym%, dd, pct were recorded to obtain discharge or death scores. finally, 36 non-survivors and 36 survivors were included to compare scores between admission and discharge or death (fig. 5(b) ). for non-survivors, scores at death was higher than that at admission (p<0.0001). for survivors, scores at discharge seemed lower than that at admission, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.080).in this retrospective cohort study, the median time from illness onset to death was 21¢0 days for severe covid-19 non-survivors. a total of 60¢2% patients had complications, and the proportion in nonsurvivors was higher than that of survivors (p<0¢05). it was reported that organ damage during hospitalization in patients with covid-19 was associated with in-hospital mortality [16à18] . respiratory failure (41¢6%) was the most common complication followed by ami (38¢9%), ali (25¢7%) and aki (23¢0%). for non-survivors, respiratory failure and secondary infection occurred firstly, followed by ami, aki, ali. ami occurred earlier than aki and ali, and that heart becomes the first organ involved might be explained by the fact that the cardiac highly expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) which was a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the spike protein of sars-cov-2, leading to directly attacked by the virus [17, 19, 20] . covid-19-induced kidney and liver injury might be related to drug hepatotoxicity or subsequent immune-mediated inflammation, such as cytokine storm, pneumonia-associated hypoxia and shock [16, 18, 21] . it was worth noting that time from aki to death was shorter than that of ami or ali. cui and co-workers indicated that cytopathic effects of sars-cov-2 on podocytes and proximal straight tubule cells may cause aki in patients with covid-19 [22] . the early monitoring of renal function should be paid more attention.the study identified several factors associated with mortality in severe patients with covid-19. the aged, chd condition, decreased lym%, elevated levels of pct and dd on admission were associated with high odds of in-hospital death. all non-survivors scored no less than 3 points before death, and dynamic profile of points showed that a high score indicated progression of disease and a higher risk of death (fig. 5) . css was established to divide mortality risk of severe cases into high-risk and low-risk groups. the risk of death in highrisk group increased significantly (p<0¢01), and there were also statistical differences in complications between low-risk and high-risk group. the css demonstrated good predictive performance with roc curve (auc=0¢919 in training cohort and 0¢938 in independent validation cohort) and calibration curve (p=0¢264 in training cohort) analysis. in validation cohort, css seemed to underestimate mortality of low-risk patients but overestimate mortality of high-risk patients in the calibration curve (fig. 3(d) ). it could be explained by the low mortality rate in wuhan leishenshan hospital since some critically ill patients were transferred to other hospitals to reduce mortality, which lead to the predicted death inconsistent with the actual observed death. the data from wuhan leishenshan hospital might not reflect the actual mortality rate of severe covid-19 in wuhan or china. the elderly was considered an important independent predictor of mortality in sars and mers, and also has been confirmed to be associated with mortality in patients with covid-19 [8,23à25] , which was also confirmed in current study. the mortality rate was the highest in patients with severe covid-19 older than 75 years (79¢2%), followed by patients aged 60à75 years old (43¢1%) and younger than 60 years (16¢1%). it was worth noting that the number of patients aged 60à75 years was the largest ( table 1 ). the elderly patients with covid-19 deserved special attention.myocardial injury was reported to be a common complication and significantly associated with fatal outcome of covid-19 [17, 26, 27] . lu et al. demonstrated that patients with underlying cardiovascular disease including chd was more prone to experience myocardial injury during the course of covid-19 and higher risk of death [27] . chd has also been found to be associated with acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in influenza and other respiratory viral infections [28, 29] . in present study, chd was one of independent risk factors to patients with covid-19. the mechanism might be that the release of inflammatory cytokines after infection probably caused reduction in coronary blood flow, decreased in oxygen supply, destabilization of coronary plaque, and microthrombogenesis, leading to myocardial injury and heart failure [17, 19, 20] .the majority of patients died of multiple organ failure. overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines released by activated immune cells and infected cells was involved in the development of organ dysfunction in sars patients and the covid-19 mortality [30] . in this analysis, pct, one of the inflammatory indicators, had a strong correlation with mortality of severe covid-19 patients, and d-dimer greater than 0¢5 mg/ml was also associated with fatal outcome. elevated d-dimer levels indicating the coagulation activation was considered to be related to sustained inflammatory response. consequently, covid-19 mortality might be due to virus-activated cytokine storm. it was valuable to incorporate inflammation indicators into the scoring system to predict the risk of mortality.lymphopenia was believed to be related to increased disease severity and decease in covid-19 patients [31] . lymphocytopenia was also common in the critically ill patients with mers infection, which was considered the result of lymphocytes apoptosis [32, 33] . therefore, it could be postulated that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induced lymphocytopenia in severe patients with sars-cov-2 infection [31] . the severity of lymphocytopenia reflected the severity of covid-19 and possessed the ability to predict mortality as a powerful predictor [4] . besides, the decreased lym% partly reflected an increase in the proportion of neutrophils, which may be related to cytokine storm induced by virus invasion.this analysis also tracked antibodies response in serum of patients with covid-19, which was considered the longest tracking to our best knowledge. it can be seen from fig. 1 that igg reached its peak at about 20à30 days both in severe and non-severe covid-19 patients. in severe patients, the level of igg declined after 30 days, which might be due to lymphocyte depletion [32] . that igm levels were still high after 30 days from illness onset in severe patients might be explained that viruses existed in severe patients for a relatively long time [34] . it was reported that the serum antibody in covid-19 had potential diagnostic value, and a higher titer of antibody was independently associated with a worse clinical classification [35, 36] . but there was no statistically significant difference in antibody levels between severe and nonsevere patients in this analysis. the number of severe cases was small in present study, which might result in less accurate results. more cases and time period tests are needed to verify.no antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective. given the high levels of cytokines induced by sars-cov, mers-cov and sars-cov-2 infections, systemic corticosteroids were often used to treat severe patients, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury [37à40]. however, it was controversial to use corticosteroids for treating influenza-associated pneumonia or ards [41] . several studies demonstrated the association of corticosteroid use with mortality, bacterial and fungal infection and the emergence of antiviral resistance [24, 42] . some evidence show that receiving corticosteroids in patients with sars and mers did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance [43à46]. further evidence was urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment was beneficial or harmful for patients with covid-19 3 . in present cohort, 16¢8% of severe covid-19 patients had complications of secondary infection, but it was not associated with the use of corticosteroids, and the difference was not statistically significant (p=0¢203). the secondary infection may be due to the immune deficiency caused by virus [47] . in addition, whether to use corticosteroids had no effect on mortality, but the use of corticosteroids in low-risk group prolonged hospital stay by 4¢5 days and durations by 7¢5 days. the css provided some guidance for the rational application of corticosteroids and the applicable populations.our study had several limitations. firstly, only 113 severe patients with covid-19 were included in the training cohort, and in independent validation group, the number of deaths was small. larger cohort studies are needed to validate the scoring system we have established. secondly, as a retrospective study, some possible risk factors reported by other studies such as lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin 6 were not presented in the study because not all laboratory tests were done in all patients resulting in the incomplete data [48] . their role might be underestimated in predicting in-hospital death. it was reasonable to assume that other possible risk factors not included to analyses might be independently associated with in-hospital death, but the current model based on the five variables has shown good performance to predict clinical outcomes. thirdly, since the vast majority of chest imaging findings were bilateral lung lesions [3] , we only used the presence of lung lesions on admission as a positive indicator of chest imaging, without considering the severity of lungs, which may underestimate the role of lung lesions. a predictive model of combined lung lesions also needs to be evaluated. finally, the data for score development and validation are entirely from wuhan, china. due to differences in medical resources, the data in this study may not be fully representative of the population in china or even the world, which could potentially limit the generalizability of the risk score in other areas of the world. additional validation studies from areas outside china should be completed. however, in the absence of a severe covid-19 death risk scoring system, this scoring system can help clinicians worldwide to judge in-hospital deaths.in conclusion, complications were associated with mortality of covid-19. the time from aki to death was the shorter than that of ali and ami. early monitoring of renal function should be paid more attention. the dynamic changes of antibodies were worth tracking, since a higher titer of antibody was considered to be independently associated with a worse clinical classification. we found that the aged, chd condition, decreased percentage of lymphocyte, elevated d-dimer and pct at admission were related to mortality of severe patients with covid-19. the css well classified severe patients into low-risk and high-risk groups, which was helpful for predicting in-hospital mortality and complications. css could help clinicians to identify high-risk patients and be alert to the occurrence of complications.all authors declare no competing interests.the first case of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars‐cov‐2) was reported in wuhan, hubei province, china, on december 31, 2019. until march, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid‐19), caused by this virus, has spread around the world. sars‐cov‐2 is human coronavirus, which does not belong to the group of benign coronaviruses that cause common cold, but to the smaller group of coronaviruses that cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus—sars and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus—mers). 1 ,  2  recently published studies showed that arterial hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were prevalent among the patients with covid‐19. 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19  investigations on the outcome of these patients are scarce, and data are very limited. nevertheless, hypertension is considered as one of the most important risk factors for covid‐19. the relationship between hypertension and adverse outcome is still questionable.the aim of this review paper was to summarize current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and covid‐19 and the role of hypertension in outcome of these patients. a comprehensive search was performed on pubmed, scopus, web of science, and google scholar, to find review papers on this topic published until may 1, 2020.sars‐cov‐2 infection is triggered when the s‐protein of the virus binds to angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ace2), which is highly expressed in the heart, lungs, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, and plays an important role in several cardiovascular and immune pathways. 20  sars‐cov‐2 binds to ace2 with much higher affinity compared to sars‐cov. 21  additionally, sars‐cov‐2 shows its pathogenic activity by attacking type ii alveolar epithelial cells that are expressing ace2. previous studies of coronavirus that causes sars demonstrated that this virus binds to ace2 in pulmonary alveoli through their superficial spike proteins, which causes lung damage and even lung function failure. 21  the loss of ace2, caused by binding sars‐cov‐2, may shift the system to an overall higher angiotensin ii and lower angiotensin‐(1‐7) tone. the role of angiotensin ii in covid‐19 hypertensive patients seems to be crucial due to its role in functioning of the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (raas) that promotes vasoconstriction, sodium retention, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis and increases the bioactive peptide angiotensin‐(1‐7). 22  epidemiological data coming from china indicate that arterial hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most prevalent concomitant diseases in patients with covid‐19  3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  11 ,  12 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16 ,  17 ,  18 ,  19 ,  23  (table 1). the number of investigations that provided at least short follow‐up with intrahospital outcome is limited. even though these data demonstrated that the prevalence of hypertension in covid‐19 patients with lethal outcome was high, 7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  10 ,  14 ,  17  it has still been debated whether hypertension was a predictor of mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors (age, obesity, diabetes) and comorbidities (coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, renal impairment).the prevalence of hypertension among patients with covid‐19, between different studies, ranged from 15%‐20%  3 ,  4 ,  11 ,  12 ,  16 ,  17  to 30%‐35%. 5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  9 ,  13  there are several reasons for these variations. average age was significantly higher in patients with elevated prevalence of hypertension, 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 ,  7 ,  13 ,  14 ,  15 ,  16  which might be the most important reason for different prevalence of hypertensive patients among studies. advanced age was associated with higher prevalence of other comorbidities such as diabetes, renal impairment, arterial hypertension, and obesity, which altogether increased proportion of hypertensive patients. 5 ,  6 ,  9 ,  13 ,  15  the prevalence of overweight and obesity was not reported in available studies about covid‐19. this “circulus vitiosus” between hypertension, obesity, and diabetes is difficult to break, and therefore, conclusion cannot be made without detailed data of all links of chain. the impact of smoking should not be forgotten in the relation between copd, hypertension, and higher propensity to covid‐19. 3 ,  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9 ,  11 ,  12  however, results are conflicting, but majority of authors did not find higher prevalence of smoking in patients with adverse outcome. 7 ,  8 ,  9  the level of renal damage cannot be excluded as one of contribute factor for higher percentage of hypertension and advance stage of covid‐19 in hypertensive patients. most of studies reported the large prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in covid‐19 patients, but they also did not classified them and therefore it is difficult to estimate the individual effect of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation on occurrence and severity of covid‐19.li et al summarized the findings from 6 studies and showed that the prevalence of hypertension, cardio‐, and cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with covid‐19 was 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7%, respectively. 17  the incidences of hypertension, cardio‐cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes were two‐ to threefolds higher in patients with severe type of covid‐19 than in their non‐severe counterparts. yang et al included 46,248 covid‐19 patients from 8 studies and reported that the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory system disease. 18  the most frequent comorbidities in severe patients were hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular disease. the large meta‐analysis that included 76,993 patients with covid‐19 found that the pooled prevalence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history, and diabetes was 16.37%, 12.11%, 7.63%, and 7.87%, respectively  19  (table 1). the authors of meta‐analyses agreed about the large heterogeneity between studies, which obviously limited the quality of their study. this can be partly explained by different designs and large variation in sample size among studies. 18 ,  19  some essential data are still missing, and it would be dangerous to ascribe the large portion of risk for sars‐cov‐2 infection or severity of covid‐19 to any risk factor, including hypertension. it would be reasonable to hypothesize that uncontrolled comorbidities, as well as combination of concomitant diseases, may increase the risk of infection and severity of covid‐19, but this has to be examined.there are many controversies about the effect of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (acei) and angiotensin ii receptor blockers (arb) in covid‐19 patients. 24  some authors expressed their concern that the use of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (raas) inhibitors and variation in ace2 expression may be partly responsible for sars‐cov‐2 virulence. 25 ,  26  population‐based studies estimated that only small proportion of hypertensive patients in china (30 to 40%) is treated with antihypertensive therapy, and raas inhibitors are used in only 25 to 30% of treated patients. 27 ,  28  therefore, it can be anticipated that only small percentage of covid‐19 patients in china were actually treated with acei or arb.on the other hand, the prevalence of cardiac damage in covid‐19 patients is not negligible, and it is associated with adverse outcome in these subjects. 5 ,  6  data regarding the frequency of heart failure in covid‐19 patients are scarce, and the same is valid for chronic kidney disease. from therapeutic point of view, acei and arb have important roles in treatment of these conditions—cardiac injury, heart failure, and renal impairment (particularly with albuminuria). therefore, withdrawing raas inhibitors or switching medications would have uncertain benefits, but very certain disadvantages.it would be expected that problem with raas inhibitors would escalate in western countries (europe and usa), where patients are taking antihypertensive medications, and particularly raas inhibitors, in significantly higher percentage than in china. however, studies from italy and usa did not show any association between raas inhibitors and susceptibility to coronavirus, complications or mortality from covid‐19. 29 ,  30 ,  31  even new investigation from china confirmed these findings. 32  the switching from the raas inhibitors to another antihypertensive therapy would lead to insufficient blood pressure control, which could induce more complications in covid‐19 patients than infection of sars‐cov‐2 itself. novel data showed that raas inhibitors could even improve the outcome of hypertensive patients with covid‐19. 33  the authors hypothesized that raas inhibitors have an indirect antiviral role by regulating immune function and inhibiting inflammatory responses. 31  based on the available data, despite some theoretical possibilities, multiple specialty societies recommended that covid‐19 patients should continue therapy with raas inhibitors. 34 ,  35 ,  36  limited number of studies provided outcome data after a short follow‐up. therefore, one should be careful in interpretation of these findings. guan et al demonstrated that patients with severe covid‐19 and those with primary end point (admission in intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death) had significantly higher percentage of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, copd, chronic renal disease, and cancer. 3  the authors did not investigate the relationship between different demographic and clinical parameters with severity of disease or the outcome.shi et al reported that hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, copd, and cancer were more prevalent in the patients with myocardial injury diagnosed by elevation of high‐sensitivity troponin i and creatinine kinase‐myocardial band (ck‐mb). 5  cardiac injury was associated with significantly higher mortality (52.1% vs. 4.5%). the authors did not investigate which comorbidities were associated with cardiac injury and mortality. it must be noted that patients with cardiac injury were significantly older. guo et al demonstrated similar results when compared covid‐19 patients with and without elevation of troponin and found that 27.8% of patients with covid‐19 had cardiac injury. 6  in this study, chronic renal dysfunction and usage of raas were also more prevalent in patients with cardiac injury. however, patients with cardiac injury were almost 20 years older and more frequently men than those without injury, which also have to be taken into account. it was also reported that underlying cardiovascular disease was worsening outcome only in patients with myocardial injury. 6  defining myocardial injury only by elevation of troponin i in these circumstances could be questionable because this biomarker may be increased in many conditions such as inflammation and/or sepsis/systemic inflammatory response syndrome and kidney injury. the authors did not clearly stated which disorders were included under the term “cardiovascular disease” and it is not clear whether hypertension was included in this term. furthermore, it is difficult to understand which cardiomyopathies were included and whether patients with heart failure were included.chen et al reported that hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes were more prevalent among covid‐19 patients who died in comparison with survivors. 7  however, there was a large difference in age and sex distribution between groups and authors did not investigate the effect of comorbidities on outcome in this population 7  (table 2). zhou et al reported that hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, and copd were more frequent among non‐survivors than in survivors. 9  the authors found that hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease were predictors of mortality in covid‐19 patients. nevertheless, none of these comorbidities remained significant predictor of mortality after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking status. these findings confirmed the importance of comprehensive risk assessment by including all relevant risk factors and comorbidities.in the large original study that included 1590 patients, guan et al showed that after adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with copd, diabetes, hypertension, and malignancy were more likely to reach the composite end points (admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death) than those without. 12  malignancy, copd, hypertension, and diabetes increased the risk of adverse outcome for 3.5‐, 2.7‐, 1.57‐, and 1.58‐fold, respectively. 12  patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly higher risk of the composite end point than patients with a single comorbidity. stratification of patients according to their age (<65 years vs ≥65 years) did not show significant difference in the strength of associations between the number of comorbidities and mortality of covid‐19. 12  however, it cannot be excluded that other confounding factors, besides aging and smoking, might also be responsible for the association between comorbidities and outcome. it would be also helpful to divide primary outcome into two separate outcomes: (a) admission to intensive care unit and/or invasive ventilation and (b) death. this would provide separated information about independent predictors of severity and mortality of covid‐19. this was performed in the small study, and authors found that hypertension and diabetes were predictors of acute respiratory distress syndrome, but not mortality in covid‐19 patients. 16  unfortunately, multivariable analysis with adjustment for relevant confounding factors was not performed in this investigation.there are a number of limitations in the mentioned investigations. the self‐reporting of comorbidities on hospital admission represents one of them. under‐reporting of comorbidities, due to the lack of awareness and/or the lack of diagnostic testing, could interfere the associations between comorbidities and clinical outcome. more importantly, the duration of follow‐up was short and some patients remained in the hospital at the time of publishing these studies, which means that real outcome was unknown. obesity was not reported in available studies, and its influence could not be investigated. furthermore, only one study reported basal values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which would help to estimate the percentage of uncontrolled hypertension. the same refers to prevalence of patients with uncontrolled diabetes. the most of studies included small number of patients, which is additional obstacle. one should not forget the fact that majority of studies come from china, and we should be cautious when extrapolating these findings to other countries with outbreak of covid‐19. studies should consider all potential sources of bias and confounding, which is why additional investigations with improved design are warranted.recent findings reported that arterial hypertension represented one of the most common comorbidities in patients with covid‐19. this prevalence ranged between 10% and 34%. the impact of hypertension on outcome and particularly on mortality in covid‐19 patients is not clear due to lack of data. studies did not provide evidence that raas inhibitors should be avoided or switched in these patients. large studies that will consider all potential sources of bias and confounding factors, as well as longer follow‐up, are necessary. the public pressure to find all answers is very high, but physicians' duty is to stay rational and has scientific approach to available and upcoming data.coronaviruses cause a spectrum of illness from asymptomatic disease to respiratory failure. early reports of coronavirus infections suggested that most infections were mild until the 2003 sars epidemic that was associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1] . in september 2012, a novel coronavirus was identified in a 60-year old man in saudi arabia [2] . a second case was identified in a qatari patient hospitalized in the united kingdom [3] . the two coronaviruses were genetically identical and similar to isolates obtained from bats [4] . in july 2013, the coronavirus study group named this new virus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) [5] .as of december 21, 2015, there have been 1625 cases worldwide with 586 deaths [6] . the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of this disease have described a spectrum of illness from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure and death. the overall mortality rate remains at 37 % [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . importantly, there are no known effective treatments. in 2014 there was an increase in mers-cov cases reported from the jeddah region of saudi arabia. to describe the changing epidemiology and outcomes, we report the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients admitted to a regional referral hospital in jeddah, saudi arabia.king fahd general hospital is an 800-bed hospital in jeddah, kingdom of saudi arabia and is a regional coronavirus referral center. there are 36 icu beds and one infectious disease physician that serves the hospital. between january through december 2014, all patients admitted or transferred to king fahd hospital with a positive mers coronavirus pcr from clinical nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates were included.all pcr testing was performed at the ministry of health regional lab in jeddah. the magna pure compact/ magna pure 96 (roche) automated system was used to extract rna from samples. primers and probes for upe and orf 1a targets of mers-cov were used from tib molbiol (germany) along with master mix from roche for the light cycler 480 ii (roche) were used to amplify upe and orf 1a gene targets. samples that tested positive for both upe and orf 1a gene targets with a cycle threshold time of less than 37 were considered confirmed cases. positive and negative controls were used to monitor the amplification process & to check for any inhibition of amplification.medical charts for all patients were reviewed and data abstracted on standardized data collection forms by an infectious disease trained physician. demographic, clinical and laboratory data were entered into a database. to understand the epidemiology, age was categorized as <30, 30-60 and >60. hypotension was defined as blood pressure <90/60 mm hg, tachypnea as a respiratory rate greater than 16, hypoxia as an oxygen saturation <90 %, thrombocytopenia as platelets <150,000/ cubic millimeter, leukopenia was defined as a white blood cell count <5000 cells/cubic millimeter and leukocytosis as a white blood cell count >10,000 cells/ cubic millimeter. renal insufficiency was defined as a creatinine >1.5 mg/dl. liver function abnormalities were defined as a lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) >300 u/liter, alanine transaminase (alt) > 50 u/liter and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) >40 u/liter. immunosuppression was defined as aids, history of organ transplant, neutropenia, known malignancy, taking immunosuppressive medication and congenital immunodeficiency. pregnancy was considered an immunosuppressed state.a modified acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation (apache 2) score was calculated using age, temperature, mean arterial blood pressure, respiratory rate, potassium, creatinine, acute renal failure, and comorbid conditions to estimate severity of illness [16] . pao2 was estimated using pulse oximetry oxygen saturation results and hematocrit was calculated by multiplying the hemoglobin times three.all statistical analyses were performed using stata software (version 13.1, college station, tx). the percent distribution of clinical variables among patients who survived and those who died were compared using the fisher exact test. a multivariate logistic regression was done on treatments administered and severity of illness to determine which treatments were associated with survival. mycophenolate mofetil was not included in this logistic regression analysis because 100 % of patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil survived. the association between severity of illness and treatments administered was assessed by performing a linear regression of treatments administered onto the modified apache 2 score.there were a total of 51 cases, thirty patients (58.8 %) of whom were saudi nationals, and 21 (41.2 %) were foreign nationals. the median age was 54 years old (iqr 36.5-58). most were male (n = 40, 78.4 %). twenty-one patients (41.2 %) had exposure to a known patient with mers coronavirus and 12 (23.5 %) were healthcare workers. none of the patients had animal exposure. two patients (3.9 %) were on pilgrimage to mecca.overall, 71 % of patient had at least one co-morbid condition. seventeen patients had diabetes (33.3 %), 25 had hypertension (49 %), 14 (27.5 %) had end stage renal disease, eight (15.7 %) had coronary artery disease and six (11.8 %) patients were immunosuppressed, two of whom were pregnant. patients received a variety of novel treatments including immunosuppressants and antivirals. forty-two (82.4 %) patients received broad-spectrum antibiotics and five (9.8 %) received hydrocortisone. thirty one patients received antiviral treatment. twenty-three patients (45.1 %) were treated with interferon beta, eight (15.7 %) were treated with interferon alpha. a variety of anti-viral combinations were used. eight patients (15.7 %) received mycophenolate mofetil, seven of these patients received it in combination with interferon beta. nineteen (37.3 %) patients required intensive care unit (icu) care, and 10 patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo). all patients treated in the icu and all patients receiving ecmo died.in this recent cohort, when comparing survivors to nonsurvivors, survival was associated with male gender, vomiting on admission, elevated respiratory rate, abnormal lung exam on physical exam, working as a healthcare worker, history of hypertension, elevated alt, clearance of mers cov on repeat pcr testing, and receiving mycophenolate mofetil or beta interferon (table 1 ). in contrast, markers of severe disease like hypotension, hypoxemia, chest radiographic abnormalities, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal failure were associated with death.treatments given were based as indicated based on the clinical assessment of the infectious disease consult team. thirty-one patients received antivirals, ribavirin or alpha or beta interferon, and 13 patients received immunosuppressive medication. most patients received a combination of alpha interferon and ribavirin (5, 9.8 %), beta interferon and ribavirin (10, 19.5 %) or beta interferon alone (11, 21.6 %). two patients received alpha interferon alone (3.9 %). eight patients received mycophenolate mofetil (15.7 %) and seven of them received this in combination with beta-interferon. five patients received hydrocortisone; two in combination with beta interferon and ribavirin and 3 in combination with alpha interferon and ribavirin. all eight patients given mycophenolate mofetil survived therefore mycophenolate mofetil could not be evaluated in this model.while the results of the univariable analysis demonstrated improved survival in patients treated with betainterferon and mycophenolate mofetil, the multivariable analysis which included a marker of severity of illness, demonstrated a strong association between severity of illness and reduced survival, and no association between treatment with beta interferon and survival. mycophenolate mofetil was not evaluable in this model ( table 2 ). in analyzing the relationship between severity of illness and treatments administered, beta interferon and mycophenolate mofetil were given to less severely ill patients (table 3) discussion mers-cov is an emerging disease for which the initial epidemiology has been described, but in-depth clinical studies and the role of therapy in incompletely understood. while the clinical features for mers-cov have been described in several large case series [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , there is a paucity of literature on therapy. our results from a relatively large number of patients demonstrate similar clinical features and mortality to previous studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . in our cohort, treatment with beta interferon and mycophenolate mofetil may be predictive of survival, but the greatest predictor of survival is the severity of illness on presentation.improved diagnostics have demonstrated an expanded spectrum of disease that includes less severe cases than previously reported. we now understand that mers-cov causes an acute respiratory disease syndrome and [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . this may be partially related to the epidemiology of increased disease transmission in healthcare settings rather than a true host risk factor. laboratory findings have been nonspecific and consistent with other viral infections. thrombocytopenia (75 %) and lymphopenia (58 %) have been commonly described in these patients [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 15] . forty three percent had acute kidney injury [7, [11] [12] [13] 17] and 76-100 % had cxr abnormalities with bibasilar infiltrates as the most common finding [8-13, 15, 18] . the outcomes in these more severely ill patients remain poor. between 50-90 % required icu care [10, 11, 13, 15] and 67-100 % in the icu setting required invasive ventilation for a median of 7-16 days [8, 10, 12] . in addition to mechanical ventilation, several patients have received extracorpeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) to support ventilation. from non-randomized data from the world health organization, five out of six patients receiving ecmo died [9] . fifty-eight to 75 % required renal replacement therapy [11, 12, 17] and 30-60 % of hospitalized patients died [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . the severity of illness can be partially explained by the widespread lung disease caused by mers-cov and it appears that mortality in those patients requiring intensive care is extremely high. although no autopsy data is available, in explanted lung, infection with mers-cov causes widespread infection and alveolar disease [19, 20] .the clinical features in our cohort similarly also show a high proportion of patients with fever (96 %) and cough (80.4 %) shortness of breath (90 %), and almost one third of patients (29.4 %) with gastrointestinal symptoms. our cohort consisted of ill patients with hypotension (15.7 %), tachypnea (76.9 %) and hypoxia (33 %). thirty seven percent required icu care and 10 patients received ecmo. similar to previous results, all of the patients who received ecmo died [9] .there is no known effective treatment for mers cov. many compounds have been screened in vitro for possible activity against this coronavirus [21] [22] [23] [24] , however, the in vivo efficacy has not been subjected to clinical investigation.in vitro data suggests that mers-cov inhibits host interferon production through various molecular pathways [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] mycophenic acid, the active agent of prodrug mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine strongly inhibit mers coronavirus in human and monkey cell lines even more so than they inhibit sars coronavirus [24, [31] [32] [33] . interferon alpha and interferon beta reduce mers coronavirus replication in explanted lung tissue [19] . in vivo, comparing host response in two patients with mers coronavirus and differing outcomes, the patient who was able to clear mers cov infection was able to mount an interferon response and the patient who died had low levels of interferon alpha suggesting a therapeutic role for interferon [34] . the combination of interferon alpha and ribavirin has been used successfully in rhesus monkeys infected with mers coronavirus [35] , and in a few small case series [36] [37] [38] . beta-interferon seems to be an even more potent inhibitor of mers coronavirus in vitro [19] [24, [31] [32] [33] . one small study with exceptionally high mortality rates using interferon beta for treatment found no difference in mortality between interferon beta use and interferon alpha use [39] . our data, albeit from a retrospective cohort support the findings that interferon beta is associated with a decrease in mortality.there are limited data on the efficacy of treatment regiments for this virulent disease. we present data from a retrospective cohort of ill patients with mers-cov and the results of the evaluation of the clinical efficacy of beta interferon beta, alpha interferon, ribavirin and mycophenolate mofetil in addition to routine supportive care. forty five percent of patents (23 patients) received interferon beta and in this cohort, sixteen percent of patients received interferon alpha (8 patients) and 37 % of patients (9 patients) received ribavirin, either in conjunction with interferon alpha or interferon beta, and 8 patient received mycophenolate mofetil. patients receiving beta interferon and mofetil had improved survival, however this was confounded by the severity of illness on presentation for beta interferon. all of the patients who received mycophenolate mofetil survived however because of the small number, we could not analyze the independent efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil.while this is a relatively large series of mers-cov cases, the primary limitation of our study is that it is a retrospective review of cases and not a randomized trial and thus subject to confounding as seen in our cohort. we used a modified apache 2 score without all of the clinical variables, which may have underestimated the association of severity of illness with reduced survival. importantly, the mortality in patients receiving additional therapies that modulate the immune response was low. all of the eight patients who received mycophenolate mofetil in our study survived. hence, it may be reasonable to further study this agent in controlled trials.this observational study investigates novel treatment options like beta interferon and mycophenolate mofetil for mers-cov in humans which have in vitro activity. our cohort demonstrated severity of illness is an important effect modifier and needs to be considered in evaluating novel agents. to better assess the efficacy of these therapies, international prospective randomized trials with adequate numbers of patients are needed to further evaluate the impact of these treatments in addition to routine supportive care when compared to other treatment options.this study was reviewed and approved by johns hopkins university institutional review board and the directorate of health affairs.data

main complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation (hsct) and respiratory viral infections (rvi) are being increasingly recognized as important complications after hsct with variable degrees of morbidity and mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] . in recent years, the growing number of hsct utilizing alternative donors and cord progenitor stem cells, along with the common use of serotherapy, has contributed to a significant increase in viral infections after hsct [5, 6] . some well-known viruses, such herpes simplex virus (hsv) and cytomegalovirus (cmv), were major causes of morbidity and mortality in hsct [7, 8] . however, since prophylactic or preemptive anti-hsv/cmv therapy became standard practice, morbidity and mortality from hsv or cmv disease are rare [9, 10] . nonetheless, respiratory viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after hsct and there is increased awareness for the diagnosis of these infections. however, no prophylactic approach for such viruses exists in hsct recipients. hence, this study's aim was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of rvi in children after hsct and describe the short-and long-term outcomes of these patients.this study was approved by our institutional research ethics board. the medical records of children who received hsct from january 2000 to biology of blood and marrow transplantation j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . b b m t . o r g december 2012 at the hospital for sick children, toronto were reviewed to identify those patients who had a positive test for respiratory virus obtained by nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa), bronchoalveolar lavage (bal), pleural tap, or lung biopsy specimen. microbiological testing included the following methodologies: (1) the following definitions were used in the study. an upper respiratory tract infection (urti) was defined as detection of an rvi from upper respiratory secretions together with symptoms from the upper respiratory tract (nose and throat). a lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) was defined as either hypoxia or pulmonary infiltrates together with identification of an rvi in upper respiratory secretion, bal, pleural tap, or lung biopsy. the day of engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days in which the peripheral absolute neutrophil count was > .5 â 10 9 /l. trm was defined as being either due to an rvi or other transplantation toxicities. death due to rvi was defined as death from respiratory failure with no other cause of the pneumonia. long-term pulmonary complication was defined as any limitation of pulmonary status, including pulmonary function tests. relapse was defined by the finding of hematologic or cytogenetic recurrence or by the initiation of therapy for recurrence. progressive disease was defined as tumor growth of more than 20% or spreading since undergoing transplantation [11] .all patients were nursed in protective isolation in single rooms with high-efficiency particulate air filters. all patients had indwelling central venous catheters and the majority received nutritional support with nasogastric feeding or total parenteral nutrition. infection prophylaxis included fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis, ganciclovir for cmv prophylaxis (2000 to 2005), and preemptive strategy from 2005 onwards. growth factors were given as indicated, and laminar air flow rooms were used from day 0 until engraftment. intravenous immunoglobulin at a dose of .5 g/kg was supplemented if the igg level was less than 400 mg/dl. the igg level was routinely monitored every week in all patients. pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis was given before hsct and after hsct for at least 6 months. pneumococcal prophylaxis with penicillin continued for at least 1 year or until the administration of pneumococcal vaccine. blood products were transfused to maintain hemoglobin concentration > 70 mg/l and platelet counts of 20,000/mm 3 . fever during the neutropenic phase was treated with broadspectrum antibiotics and amphotericin or caspofungin, as necessary, and modified subsequently according to the results of blood or tissue cultures.patients received their preparatory regimen, underwent transplantation, and recovered in the hospital, where they were examined by the medical team twice each day until they achieved engraftment. all patients with respiratory symptoms were investigated for the presence of respiratory viruses. chest radiographs and computed tomography scans were obtained if clinically indicated. npas, throat swaps, or nasal swabs were used for obtaining upper respiratory specimens. bal or pleural tap and/or lung biopsy were used for obtaining lower respiratory specimens.the primary endpoint of the study was to review all rvi-positive patients after hsct and describe their outcome in terms of trm and long-term pulmonary complications.univariate logistic regression models were constructed to analyze the impact of risk factors on trm within the first 100 days, including transplantation type (allogeneic versus autologous), graft type (bone marrow versus peripheral blood stem cells versus cord blood), utilization of serotherapy (antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab [mabcampath; genzyme canada inc., mississauga, ontario], and no serotherapy), and underlying disorder (malignant versus benign). all reported p values were 2-sided, and a significance level of .05 was used. all statistical analyses were carried out using spss version 12.5.eight hundred forty-four patients underwent hsct at the hospital for sick children, toronto, canada during the study period and comprise the study population. the transplant recipients consisted of 341 female and 503 male patients, with a median age of 7.5 years (range, 1 month to 17.8 years). the hsct was allogeneic in 491 patients and autologous in 353 patients. the diseases for which hsct was performed were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n ¼ 138), acute myeloid leukemia (n ¼ 110), myelodysplastic syndrome (n ¼ 21), severe aplastic anemia (n ¼ 49), inherited marrow failure (n ¼ 29), primary immune deficiency (n ¼ 58), non-hodgkin lymphoma (n ¼ 44), hodgkin disease (n ¼ 28), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n ¼ 16), metabolic diseases (n ¼ 25), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n ¼ 17), brain tumors (n ¼ 103), solid tumors (n ¼ 179), thalassemia (n ¼ 15), and others (n ¼ 12).during the study period and among the 844 hsct recipients, 96 patients with rvi were documented. screening for causes of death in the 96 patients, we found that rvi was never the cause of death after day 100 after hsct. in the first 100 days after hsct, there were 54 patients with rvi. as these 54 patients were the focus of the study, their diagnosis and conditioning regimen including use of serotherapy are described in table 1 . only 1 patient with diagnosis of severe combined immune deficiency (scid)/omenn's syndrome received conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. the remaining 5 scid patients did not receive any conditioning regimen. when analyzing utilization of serotherapy, we found 11 patients who received antithymocyte globulin and 1 who received alemtuzumab.the overall frequency of documented rvi in the first 100 days after hsct was 6.4%. the frequency was slightly higher in allogeneic (6.5%) than in autologous (6.2%) transplantations (p ¼ .867). twenty-three patients had lrti: 17 occurring in allogeneic patients and 6 in autologous hsct patients. the frequency of a lrti was 3.5% in allogeneic and 1.7% in autologous hsct patients. nineteen patients had parainfluenza infections (11 allogeneic, 8 autologous figure 1 , with the number of patients who contracted rvi in each month displayed. thirty-five of the 54 total rvi were contracted between october and march, which is the high flu season in canada. with march being the worst month. comparing positive rvi patients versus negative patients, there was a statistically significant difference for contracting rvi in the high season versus the low season (35 of 427 versus 19 of 417, p ¼ .03).eleven patients required mechanical ventilation (parainfluenza, 4; influenza, 3; rsv, 2; adenovirus, 2). four allogeneic and 1 autologous hsct recipients died within 100 days after transplantation because of the rvi and all of them were mechanically ventilated. thus, the overall mortality was 10.0% (13.3% allogeneic and 4.8% autologous, p ¼ .304). none of the 4 allogeneic transplant recipients who died had acute gvhd. two of the 19 patients with parainfluenza infections died (1 patient was treated with ribavirin). two additional patients with parainfluenza infection died; 1 from liver veno-occlusive disease and another from pulmonary hypertension. thus, the mortality caused by parainfluenza was 10.5% and the total mortality with a diagnosis of parainfluenza was 21%. for those with adenovirus respiratory infection (n ¼ 4), 2 patients died of adenovirus infections. the mortality caused by adenovirus infection was 50%. one of 15 patients died of rsv infection. the mortality caused by rsv infection was 6.7% and that patient was treated with ribavirin. none of 12 patients with influenza, hmpv, coronavirus, and rhinovirus infections died from respiratory complications. after day 100 after hsct, 3 more patients died from trm but death was not related to respiratory problems. the remaining 43 patients were followed for a median of 4.3 years (range, 1.4 to 11.8). no chronic pulmonary complication or allo-immune lung syndrome was observed.two patients died from parainfluenza lrti. a 1-year-old patient with wiskott-aldrich syndrome who underwent unrelated cord blood transplantation developed respiratory distress on day 24 after transplantation. npa was positive for parainfluenza type 3 antigen. ribavirin, nitric oxide, and high-frequency oscillator support were given. the second patient was a 2-year-old boy with diagnosis of relapse acute myeloid leukemia who underwent matched sibling bone marrow transplantation. parainfluenza type 1 antigen was positive from npa on day 19 after hsct. this patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) with radiographic findings consistent with pneumonitis.a 2-month-old patient with diagnosis of scid with omenn's syndrome underwent matched sibling bone marrow transplantation. this patient developed ards from rsv pneumonitis on day 11 after hsct. two patients died from adenovirus pneumonitis and ards. an 18-month-old patient with diagnosis of neuroblastoma stage 4 underwent autologous hsct after highdose chemotherapy. this patient had delayed engraftment and developed ards, which was positive for adenovirus from bal and pleural fluid. another patient was an 11-yearold boy who underwent unrelated cord blood transplantation for severe aplastic anemia. this patient had primary graft failure, subsequently developed respiratory distress, and required high-frequency oscillation. adenovirus was positive from bal and lung biopsy.type of transplantation, graft type, utilization of serotherapy, and underlying malignant disorder were analyzed using univariate analysis. none of these factors were significantly correlated with trm (type of transplantation [p ¼ in this large pediatric study, we found that 6.5% of patients receiving allogeneic or autologous hsct had a positive rvi that led to 10% overall mortality in the first 100 days after hsct. mortality was higher for allogeneic recipients: 13.3% compared with 4.8% for autologous recipients. furthermore, for a median follow-up of 4.3 years (range, 1.4 to 11.8) patients who tested positive for respiratory virus but did not die had no long-term pulmonary complications and patients who contracted the virus after 100 days after hsct did not have an adverse event.the total incidence of rvi in this study was consistent within the range of 5% to 11% by previous published data of pediatric hsct recipients [12, 13] . however, our study particularly reported the incidence of rvi within the first 100 days after transplantation, as it is a very distinct pattern in our population and different from aforementioned studies. our data showed that rvi episodes were clustering within the first 100 days after transplantation. only 1 patient developed influenza a urti at 5 months after hsct but no serious respiratory complication was observed. similar to patients who were diagnosed with urti and lrti after 6 months after hsct, none had prolonged admission or died from respiratory illnesses.we supplemented our routine viral respiratory diagnostics with pcr testing (adenovirus pcr, pandemic influenza pcr, multiplex respiratory pcr), if requested by the treating physician. pcr has been proven to be a more specific, sensitive, and rapid method for detecting respiratory viruses compared with antigen testing and viral culture and was likely responsible for increasing our rates of detection, though changes in methodology over the study time frame mean that testing algorithms were applied differently as testing methodologies changed [14] [15] [16] .even with a lower incidence of adenovirus compared with parainfluenza and rsv infections in this study, the respiratory-related mortality was higher for adenovirus, ie, 50%. all 4 patients were confirmed to have a positive adenovirus pcr from either bal or pleural fluid and lung biopsy after diagnosis of lrti. moreover, 2 patients who died from severe pneumonitis and ards with a positive adenovirus pcr test did not have another apparent cause of respiratory illness. it was described that disseminated adenovirus infection can cause pulmonary consolidation, such as bacterial pneumonia [17, 18] . because of similar clinical and radiographic findings, adenovirus infection may be under-recognized as a cause of fatal pneumonia in immunocompromised patients with severe lymphopenia or lymphocyte dysfunction. likewise, our 2 patients with adenovirus infection both had delayed engraftment.adenovirus infection is associated with high mortality, up to 100% in the pediatric hsct [19] [20] [21] . routine monitoring for adenoviremia is recommended after hsct because of asymptomatic reactivation in most cases [22] . cidofovir is widely used for both preemptive and therapeutic treatment of adenovirus infection despite well-recognized toxicities [23, 24] . identification of patients at risk of adenovirus infection is very crucial, as immune reconstitution is a key factor for reactivation. rapid withdrawal of immunosuppressive medications should also be considered whenever possible [25] .respiratory-related mortality from parainfluenza virus in this study is lower, 10.5%, than in other studies, which showed approximately 30% to 70%. this could be explained by very early years when transplantations were completed and the mainly adult study population in previous reports [26] [27] [28] [29] . a large retrospective cohort study from fred hutchinson cancer research center described unrelated transplantation as the major risk factor for parainfluenza virus acquisition as well the use of high-dose corticosteroids [29] . for our 2 patients who died from parainfluenza virus pneumonia, 1 with diagnosis of wiskott-aldrich syndrome received methylprednisolone as gvhd prophylaxis for an unrelated cord blood transplantation. however, another patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia did not develop gvhd or receive any corticosteroids treatment. aerosolized ribavirin was given to the first patient but it was given later during the course of pneumonia. the benefit of using aerosolized ribavirin in the treatment of parainfluenza pneumonia among hsct recipients is controversial [26, 28] . the early diagnosis of parainfluenza infection could expedite ribavirin treatment initiation and improve the outcome [25] . the incidence of rsv infection in this study was 28% and lrti composed more than one half of all rsv infections. interestingly, the mortality is only 6.7%, which is lower than 20% to 40% in other studies in hsct recipients [1] . treatment with aerosolized ribavirin in 6 of 7 patients with rsv lrti may potentially be the reason for lowered mortality, although 1 fatal case was observed after the patient received ribavirin. hsct recipients have high potential for progression from urti to severe lrti without well-defined and specific risk factors for death [4, 30, 31] . a pooled analysis by shah and chemaly suggested that ribavirin treatment with/without rsv-specific immunoglobulin or palivizumab had lower rates of mortality by almost one-third in a review of 21 separate studies [32] . another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for rsv urti did not show protective effect of progression to lrti [33] [34] [35] .no death associated with influenza, hmpv, rhinovirus, and coronavirus infections was observed in this study. high mortality between 15% and 70% has been reported in hsct recipients with influenza infection, but recent data showed an improvement with the availability of neuraminidase inhibitors [36, 37] . an inactivated vaccine is the only prophylactic approach for influenza infection, but it appears to be less effective in hsct recipients, particularly in the first few months after transplantation, as well as in patients who required immunosuppressive agents for gvhd treatment [38] [39] [40] [41] . however, the influenza vaccine is considered to be safe as no major local or general adverse effects were reported after use in transplant recipients [42] . hmpv infection has been reported with an incidence of 3% to 9% in adult hsct recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies. hmpv may be associated with severe pneumonia and fatal lower -respiratory tract disease in hsct recipients [43] . even though hmpv infections are documented in asymptomatic cases [44] , further analysis of a larger number of patients is necessary to identify its real impact in after transplantation population. for human rhinovirus and coronavirus, despite the high incidence of infections among hsct recipients, morbidity and mortality are both relatively low. asymptomatic detections are common, accounting for 13% and 41% of patients with rhinovirus and coronavirus, respectively [45] .mortality is higher in allogeneic hsct and recipients of cord blood transplants. however, no significant difference was observed by univariate analysis. previous studies revealed gvhd and use of immunosuppressive agents as major risk factors associated with lrti and mortality [46] [47] [48] .because of the small number of patients who developed gvhd in our study, logistic regression analysis could not be performed. likewise, various conditioning regimens were used in our 5 patients who died from rvi. we are unable to establish the correlation between transplantation type and respiratory viruseassociated death.the strength of our study is in the large number of patients examined from a single center with a uniform isolation practice, contact precautions, and supportive care. the limitation is in the retrospective nature of the study design. nonetheless, with an incidence of 6.5% among hsct recipients, prospective studies could be a challenge and when using multiple centers, another challenge arises in terms of isolation practices, infection precautions, and supportive care heterogeneity among hsct centers.finally, given the high mortality that is associated with viral infections in the first 100 days after hsct in our study, it may be intuitive to avoid admission of patients in the high season for respiratory viruses, especially in a country such as canada where there is a significant difference between summer and winter temperatures. in canada, the high season for respiratory viral infections span between october and march and in our study, 35 patients (65%) contracted rvi during the high season, compared with 19 patients (35%) in the remaining months. this may not be feasible for children who need their hsct urgently, for example those with aggressive leukemia, but may be appropriate for those with elective nonmalignant hsct to minimize their risk of acquiring these infections early after hsct.the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease began with a simple case of pneumonia in wuhan, china, in late december, 2019. by 30 th january, 2020, world health organization (who) declared the disease as a public health emergency of international concern and renamed it as covid- 19 [1] . less than a month later, on february 24 th , the state of kuwait confirmed 3 patients on a flight coming from islamic republic of iran to have contracted the virus, marking the start of the outbreak in the country [2] . by 3 rd march, 2020, the first covid-19 patient was admitted to the icu. in the next couple of months, more than 100 covid-19 confirmed cases got admitted to the icu.the covid-19 pandemic is considered one of the greatest global public health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic [3] . although the clinical spectrum of the infection appears to be broad, patients infected with covid-19 are found to be at high risk of developing pneumonia, ards, or multi-organ failure that requires hospitalization and admission under a critical care unit [4] . the major etiology agent of covid-19 is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). coronaviruses are minute single-stranded rna viruses that belong to a broad family named coronaviridae. earlier, these viruses were believed to infect only animals. in 2002, the world saw the first instance of human coronavirus infection with the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in china.the main etiological agent responsible for sars was identified to be sars-cov [5] . the next major coronavirus-related disease was the middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) that arose in saudi arabia in 2012, which was caused by the mers-cov [6] .the sars-cov-2 is closely related to the sars-cov; the difference between the two viruses lies in the mortality and transmission rates. the transmission rate of sars-cov-2 is much higher than that of sars-cov as well as mers-cov. however, sars-cov-2 has much lower mortality rate (~2.9%) compared to that of sars-cov (9%).however, even after encountering two coronavirus-related diseases, the lack of adequate preparedness and late implementation of the countermeasures led to a drastic global spread of covid-19 within a short period of time. furthermore, lack of an appropriate vaccine has also contributed to the spread of this disease and the high mortality, despite low mortality rate of the virus itself. several epidemiological studies have shown that advanced age and presence and history of severe comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases, are significantly associated with covid-19-related mortality. moreover, covid-19-related mortality has been attributed to virus-activated "cytokine storm syndrome" [7] .till date, several studies are still being conducted to elucidate the epidemiology and prevalence of covid-19 across different countries. the high rate of spread of this disease has put a lot of burden on an already overwhelmed healthcare system. this has led to development of new covid-19-specific treatment centers and prioritizing the use of medical resources based on patient characteristics. understanding the risk factors ofintensive care unit (icu) admission is an important factor in triage decision making and identification of the patients that might benefit more from critical care services [8] . here, we assessed the clinical characteristics and identified the mortality-associated predictive factors in covid-19 patients of kuwait who were admitted to the icu. to the best of our knowledge, there is no literature that describes the clinical characteristics of icu-admitted covid-19 patients from our demographic region.we conducted a retrospective study consisting of patientsadmitted to the icu at jaber al-ahmad hospital, between 1 st march 2020 and 30 th april 2020.the patient outcome was followed up till 20 th may 2020. jaber alahmad al sabah hospital was designated as national hospital for the management of covid-19 infected patients in kuwait. the hospital initially hadthree icus (120 beds) and, as the pandemic progressed, the icu bed capacity was increased to 145 beds.we enrolled patients aged ≥ 18 years admitted to icu due to covid-19 infection as confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chainreaction (rt-pcr) assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. management and treatment of covid-19 icu patients were according to the published international and local guidelines [9] .patient data wereextracted from the electronic medical records using standardized data collection sheet. we recorded the information on pre-existing medical condition including hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, bronchial asthma, chronic renal failure,malignancy, and autoimmune diseases), home medications, exposure history (i.e., travel or sick contact), and presenting symptoms prior to admission, such as fever, sore throat/ nasal or sinus congestion, cough/chest pain, vomiting/diarrhea, and fatigue/myalgia. we collected the laboratory and radiological test results upon admission to icu. chest x-ray and ct-scan findings were categorized as normal, unilateral infiltration, bilateral infiltration, and ground glass appearance.ct-scan chest and echocardiographs were requested as clinically indicated and at the discretion of the treating physicians. we also recorded data on maximum respiratory support (i.e.. low flow nasal cannula, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and intubation) and additional adjunctive support, including inhaled nitric oxide, inotropes, renal replacement therapy (rrt) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo). information on patient-specific therapies, such as administration of hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, and convalescent plasma,was also collected. all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv

berlin guidelines [10] , and the quick sequential failure assessment (qsofa) score was calculated upon admission according to the third international consensus definitions task force for sepsis and septic shock [11] . secondary infection was defined as clinical signs of pneumonia or bacteremia and positive culture on blood or body fluid, or endotracheal or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the ministry of health of kuwait (irb 2020/1411).we reported continuous variables as median (interquartile range [iqr] ) and categorical variables as number and percentage. with mortality as the outcome of interest, differences between the deceased patients and the discharged patients were analyzed using fisher's exact test for categorical variables and mann-whitney u test for continuous variables.we dichotomized the laboratory findings based on the clinical assessment and normal references. we used multivariate logistic regression model to identify predictors of mortality.variables that were found to be significant during the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate regression model. age was included in the final model as it had been described to be a risk factor for mortality in previous studies. [7] variables with more than 50% missing values were not included in the model (such as, high sensitivity cardiac troponin). final model fitting was evaluated using hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit test(p value=0.468).statistical analysis was performed using stata/ic 14 (stata corp, college station, texas), and 2-tailed p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant without adjustment for multiple testing.as of may 20 th 2020, among the 103 patients, 47 (45.6%)patients have been discharged, 45 (43.7%) patients died, and 11 (10.7%) patients remained in icu.the median age was 53 years [iqr: 44-63] and majority of the patients (85.5% [88/103]) were male. two or more comorbidities were present in 37% (38/103) of the patients with diabetes mellitus being the most common (in 39% (40/103) patients) followed by hypertension (35%(36/103) patients).about 33%, 12.7%, and 9.8% of the patients were on insulin, beta blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (acei), respectively.the most common presenting symptoms were fever (61%), followed by cough/chest pain (48%). travel history and contact exposure with a covid-19 infected person were documented in 28% of the patients. the median duration of symptoms was 2 days [iqr:1-5] and 5 days [iqr:1-8] prior to hospital and icu admission, respectively (table 1) .there was no significant difference in age, gender, and nationality between the discharged and deceased patients. deceased patients were more likely to have more than two comorbidities compared to the discharged patients (56% versus 27%; p = 0.017). higher proportion of deceased patients were hypertensive compared to discharged group (56% versus 24%; p =0.003). travel history was less likely to be reported among the deceased patients compared to the discharged patients (4.6% versus 21.7%; p =0.028). moreover, deceased patients tended to exhibit higher qsofa score than the discharged patients (p =0.05) ( table 1) . table 2 shows the laboratory and radiological findings of the patients on admission to icu.total lymphocyte countsand serum albumin levels were significantly lower among the deceased patients. levels of creatinine, procalcitonin (pct), c-reactive protein crp), all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 20, 2020. difference between the groups on the basis of the radiological findings.treatment and clinical course are shown in table 3 . most patients (96%) were treated with antibiotics.antiviral therapy (ritonavir-lopinavir) was used for 82.5% of the patients, while oseltamivir was used for 27% of the patients. hydroxychloroquine was administered in 78% of the patients. among the 103 patients, only 14.6% received systemic steroids. majority of the patients (76.7%) were intubated and mechanically ventilated, and 50% of the patients wereprone positioned.a total of nine patients (8.7%) required ecmo, nine patients (8.7%) received inhaled nitric oxide (ino), and three patients (2.9%) received convalescent plasma.moderate/ severe ards was present in 76% of the patients, and 25% patients developed secondary bacterial infection. inotropic support was used for 73% of the patients, and the proportion of deceased patients who required inotropic support was significantly higher than that in the discharged patients (86.4% versus 50%; p <0.001). renal replacement therapy (rrt) was used in 20.4% of the patients and two of the patients who had pre-existing chronic kidney disease needed rrt. moreover, among the deceased patients,intubation, rrt, moderate/severe ards,and secondary bacterial infection were observed more frequently than the discharged patients. median time to discharge from icu was 10 days (iqr:6-15), and median time to death was 13 days (iqr: 7-23).all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 20, 2020. table 4 ).in this retrospective case series, we described the clinical characteristics and mortality-related predictors in adult patients with confirmed covid-19 who were admitted to the critical care unit between 3 rd march 2020 and 30 th april 2020. the patient outcome was followed up to 20 th may 2020. the major outcome assessed here was patient mortality. the median age of our patients was 53 years. we evaluated the association between the patient's demographic, laboratory, and clinical data and mortality. we found that, similar to other studies, there was no correlation between mortality and gender. however, unlike other studies, we did not find any significant correlation between advancing age and patient mortality. this finding could be attributed to the fact that most of the patients recruited were aged between 44 and 63 years, while other studies include higher proportion of individuals >65 years of age, which results in more significant association between age and mortality [7, 12] .several studies have shown that presence of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and secondary infections, contributes significantly to disease severity and mortality among covid-19 patients [7, 13, 14] . in our study, we found that 37% of the patients who were admitted to the icu exhibited presence of previous comorbidities, the most common being diabetes (39.2%) and hypertension (35%). similarly, in the death group, most of the patients suffered from hypertension (51.1%) and diabetes (51.1%). this finding was consistent with all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 20, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.20134007 doi: medrxiv preprint those of previous studies [14] . furthermore, our results also indicated hypertension to be an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted or: 3.2; 95%ci: 1.2-8.9). moreover, compared to the discharge group, more than double the number of patients in the death group suffered from two or more comorbidities.in several studies, the icu mortality has been associated with organ dysfunction. qsofa is a recently developed scoring system used to assess the organ dysfunction. although qsofa score does not directly evaluate patient mortality, previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between mortality and dysfunction [15] . in our study too, higher proportion of the patients in the death group showed higher qsofa scores compared to the patients in the discharged group (35.6% vs. 22.2%, respectively); however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.245).our results also indicated that the patient mortality was significantly associated with higher levels of (hs) troponin , pct, and crp. elevated (hs) troponin levels have previously been associated with acute coronary syndrome, reduced left ventricular function, and higher levels of il-6 and tnf-alpha, which ultimately leads to mortality among the icu patients [16] .pct, precursor of calcitonin, is mainly released during bacterial sepsis and tissue injury. it has previously been recognized as an indicator of severity of organ failure and mortality among the icu patients [17, 18] . it is noteworthy that high pct levels are associated with bacterial infection, which indicates that the death among the covid-19 patients with elevated pct might be due to secondary bacterial infections. this assumption was supported by our results that showed that compared to the discharge group, higher proportion of patients in the death group suffered from bacterial infections. crp is a well-known plasma protein, which is involved in inflammatory reactions, and elevated crp levels have been significantly associated with several cardiovascular disorders, organ failure, and mortality among the icu patients [19, 20] . all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 20, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.20134007 doi: medrxiv preprint furthermore, lower levels of lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and albumin have also been associated with patient mortality. within the death group, 37.8% and 22.2% of the patients exhibited albumin < 22 g/l and lymphocytes < 0.5 x 10 9 /l, which was significantly higher compared to the discharge group (10.6% and 4.3%, respectively) (p < 0.05). our results corroborated with those of previous studies [21, 22] . furthermore, d-dimer has been previously shown to a sensitive independent predictor of mortality among icu patients [23] , which was corroborated by our results. we observed that, compared to the discharge group, significantly higher proportion of patients in the death group exhibited d-dimer > 1200 ng/ml (p = 0.023). however, a few studies have discouraged the use of d-dimer quantification for mortality prediction in icu patients [24] .with respect to the treatment approach adopted, we found that the requirement of inotropic support and intubation was significantly higher among the patients of the death group. in addition, rrt requirement was also found to be significantly associated with patient mortality, even after adjusting for the confounding factors (adjusted or: 9.3; 95%ci: 2.4-36.2). it is worth mentioning that although high flow nasal cannula and non-invasive mechanical ventilation were only used in 21% and 2% of our patients respectively, none of them died, this could indicate a survival benefit for patients who receive non-invasive ventilation. however, it is very difficult to draw this conclusion at this point due to the nature of our study, and such result could be confounded.there were several limitations of our study. firstly, the sample size in our study was relatively small. recruitment of a higher number of patients could have provided a clearer picture. secondly, the patient data was collected retrospectively from their electronic records, which often had incomplete information. this could lead to information bias. thirdly, there was no standard protocol for laboratory workup of the patients during icu admission. this led to the absence of the results of some laboratory tests for some patients. due to this, the all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 20, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.20134007 doi: medrxiv preprint laboratory-based data for some patients could not be included in the regression model, which might lead to discrepancy with respect to mortality predictors. finally, at the end of the follow-up period, 11 patients were still in icu, among which six were intubated, and one was on ecmo. this could again lead to bias in our final analysis as the mortality among these patients remained undefined. we propose for the future studies to recruit higher number of patients and to follow them up for a longer duration to further elucidate the factors that contribute to mortality among the covid-19 patients.our observational study involving critically ill patients with confirmed covid-19 showed no significant differences in mortality based on age, gender, or nationality. several risk factors were identified to predict mortality. based on our results, we established a set of predictive factors "hard pal," which can be used as a tool to predict mortality in critically ill covid-19 patients. more multicentric large studies are needed to validate the significance of these predictors with respect to patient mortality.severe ards (po2/fio2 is less than 100) r renal replacement therapy (rrt) d d-dimer more is than 1200 ng/ml p procalcitonin level is more than 0.2 ng/ml a serum albumin is less than 22 g/l l lymphocytic count is less than 0.5. 10 9 /l all rights reserved. no reuse allowed without permission.(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted june 20, 2020.

medrxiv preprint in december 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection causing pneumonia began in wuhan, china, and is rapidly spreading worldwide. 1 by april 11, 2020, 1,610 ,909 cases of covid-19 had been diagnosed, and 99,690 cases of covid-19 patients had died. the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported 81% mild, 14% severe, and 5% critical cases. 2 the case fatality rate is estimated to be between 4.3% and 11.0%, lower than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome, but higher than that of influenza. 3 there are several established clinical scoring systems for detecting patients at high risk for a suspected infection. the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) score was developed during a 1991 consensus conference to improve early detection of sepsis in patients. 4 sirs consists of four variables: body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and white-blood-cell count with differentials. however, it has limited value for predicting mortality among infected adults in 5 and outside 6 an intensive care unit (icu) setting.the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qsofa) criteria, consisting of the respiratory rate, glasgow coma scale, and systolic blood pressure, were proposed in 2016. qsofa is better at predicting in-hospital mortality than sirs outside an icu setting 6 but it has lower prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than does an increase in qsofa score of 2 or more in an icu setting. 5 the national early warning score (news) consists of seven parameters to improve the early detection of and response to clinical deterioration. 7 news has equivalent or superior accuracy to that of sirs and qsofa for predicting clinical deterioration in infected patients outside the icu. 8, 9 to date, there is no effective antiviral treatment for covid-19. thus, early recognition of patients at high risk is important, as is close monitoring to provide the necessary interventions at the right time. this study compared the predictive values of preexisting clinical scoring systems in patients with covid-19.we performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with sars-cov-2 infection hospitalised at yeungnam university medical center (a 930-bed, university-affiliated, tertiary referral hospital in daegu, south korea) from february 19, 2020 to march 26, 2020 . the final date of follow-up was april 10, 2020.during the study period, all consecutive adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with sars-cov-2 infection admitted to the hospital via the emergency or outpatient department were eligible for inclusion. seven patients who were transferred to other hospitals and whose final clinical results were unknown were excluded from the analyses.patients' electronic medical records were reviewed. data on patients' age, sex, comorbidities, vital signs, and complications were collected. sirs 10 assesses the systemic inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical situations. sirs is manifested by two or more of the following conditions: temperature > 38°c or < 36°c; heart rate > 90 beats per minute; respiratory rate > 20 breaths per minute or paco 2 < 32 mm hg; and white-blood-cell count > 12,000/cu mm, < 4,000/cu mm, or > 10% immature (band) forms.the qsofa 11 is a rapid bedside clinical scoring system for detecting patients with a suspected infection who are at higher risk for a poor clinical outcome. the qsofa scale assigns a score of 1 point to each of three parameters related to organ function: respiratory rate, glasgow coma scale, and systolic blood pressure. qsofa scores of 2 or higher indicate higher inhospital mortality.the news 12 is an early warning score to improve early detection of, and response to, clinical deterioration. it is composed of seven parameters: pulse oximetry, oxygen, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, respiration rate, temperature, and central nervous system status. each parameter is assigned a score of 0-3 points. the score reflects the extent to which the parameters differ. news is stratified into three categories: low risk (0-4), medium risk (5) (6) , and high risk (≥ 7). 13 critical outcomes were defined as icu care or death. critical patients were defined as patients representing the critical outcomes. acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) was defined according to the berlin definition. 14 septic shock was defined according to the third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3). 15primary endpoints were the 28-day mortality and critical outcomes. secondary endpoints were complications such as ards, septic shock, and icu care.continuous variables are expressed as means ± standard deviations (sds) and were compared using student's t-test or the mann-whitney u test. categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 test or fisher's exact test. area under a receiver operating characteristic (auroc) curve analyses were performed to assess the effectiveness of sirs, qsofa, and news for predicting a covid-19 prognosis. to compare the effectiveness of the three scoring systems, pairwise comparisons of auroc curves were conducted. survival probability was calculated according to the news stratification using kaplan-meier analyses and compared using the log-rank test. in all analyses, p < 0.05 in two-tailed tests was considered to indicate statistical significance. all statistical procedures were performed using spss software (ver. 24.0; spss inc., chicago, il, usa).this study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of yeungnam university hospital (yuh irb 2020-03-057). the requirement for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective study design.the demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients are presented in table 1 . this study included 110 patients with sars-cov-2, 15 (13.6%) of whom were critical cases. sixty two patients were women (56.4%) and their mean age was 56.9 ± 17.0 years. the critical group was significantly older than the non-critical group ( years, p = 0.002). the critical group was significantly more likely to have diabetes mellitus (66.7% vs. 20.0%, p < 0.001). respiration rates were significantly higher in the critical group (24.3 ± 5.4 vs. 20.5 ± 1.6, p = 0.016). the critical group had many complications, such as ards (13/15 patients; 86 .7%), septic shock (8/15; 53.3%), and icu care (13/15; 86 .7%), and 28-day mortality was high (6/15; 40.0%). sirs, qsofa, and news differed significantly between the critical and non-critical groups.comparisons of components of the scoring systems in patients with covid-19 are shown in table 2 . based on sirs, respiration-rate scores were significantly higher in the critical group (0.7 ± 0.5 vs. 0.2 ± 0.4, p < 0.001). based on qsofa, respiration-rate scores were significantly higher in the critical group (0.7 ± 0.5 vs. 0.1 ± 0.3, p < 0.001), while systolic bp scores were significantly lower in the critical group (0.0 ± 0.0 vs. 0.1 ± 0.3, p = 0.002). based on news, respiration rates, oxygen saturation, any supplemental oxygen, and heart-rate scores differed significantly between the two groups.receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves for the prediction of complications and mortality using the three scoring systems table 3 shows the prevalence of complications, 28-day mortality, and critical outcomes in different stratifications of the sirs, qsofa, and news.the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), and negative predictive value (npv) of news for prediction of critical outcomes were 86.7%, 90.5%, 59.1%, and 97.7%, respectively, when news ≥ 5 (medium risk). with a threshold value of 7 points (high risk), these values were 60.0%, 96.8%, 75.0%, and 93.9%, respectively ( table 4) .the kaplan-meier survival curves for cumulative risk of 28-day mortality according to the news stratification are shown in fig. 2 . survival time was significantly shorter for patients with news ≥ 7 than for those with news < 7 (log-rank test, p < 0.001).in this study, 110 hospitalised patients with sars-cov-2 infection were analysed, 15 (13.6%) of whom were critical cases, and the 28-day mortality rate was 5.5%. auroc values for the prediction of 28-day mortality were: sirs = 0. 10 ( septic shock (sepsis-3) were issued in 2016. 15 the previous definition of sepsis was infection with more than two of the four sirs criteria focused on inflammatory excess, and sirs criteria did not reflect dysregulated host responses or the presence of organ dysfunction from infection. if two of the four sirs criteria were used to define sepsis, one in eight people with infection, organ failure, and significant mortality rates were excluded. 16 in addition, almost 50% of patients hospitalised in general wards developed sirs at least once during hospitalisation, suggesting that sirs criteria have poor discriminant validity and are ineffective for detecting sepsis. 17 definitions of sepsis and septic shock were revised in 2016 by an increase in the sofa score of more than two had better prognostic accuracy for predicting mortality compared to sirs in patients with infection. 5, 18, 19 however, a sofa score includes six parameters and requires laboratory tests (pao 2 , platelets, bilirubin, and creatinine). using simpler and more useful criteria, the qsofa was introduced, which showed great prediction validity for in-hospital mortality (auroc = 0.81; 95% ci, 0.80-0.82), and was statistically better than sofa or a change in sofa score in non-icu patients. 11 the news showed a great ability to discriminate infected patients at high risk for clinical deterioration at the time of admission 13 in the emergency department 20 and outside the icu. 9our data focussed on covid-19 patients at the time of admission. in our study, sirs, qsofa, and news all had significantly high scores in the critical patient group. in most cases, there were significant differences in scores related to breathing and oxygenation. sun et al. 21 reported that oxygen supplementation is an independent risk factor for novel coronavirus pneumonia progressing to a critical condition, and blood oxygen saturation (spo 2 ) < 93% when breathing room air needs critical-care management. the chinese center for disease control and prevention divided the clinical manifestations of the disease into three degrees of severity, and dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min, or an spo2 ≤ 93% were classified as severe disease. 2 based on our results and other findings, difficulty in breathing, hypoxia, and any oxygen requirements in the early stage of hospitalisation are considered important indicators for predicting progress to a serious condition. in our study, news at admission showed equivalent or superior accuracy to that of sirs and qsofa for predicting clinical deterioration, such as ards, septic shock, icu care, 28-day mortality, and critical outcomes in covid-19 patients. as shown in table 3 , sirs and qsofa indicated a higher frequency of poor clinical outcomes in groups with lower risk. the low accuracy of sirs and qsofa prediction in covid-19 clinical outcomes is that there are many "silent hypoxemia" patients in severe covid-19. patients with silent hypoxemia seem to breathe comfortably, but in fact, oxygen saturation if often low when measured through pulse oximetry. for this reason, sirs and qsofa has limitations in predicting the outcomes of covid-19. the high accuracy of news predictions in covid-19 clinical outcomes is interpreted to be related to the aforementioned factors (breathing, hypoxia, and oxygen requirements), which are three of the variables in news.early detection is important in covid-19, as pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus is often fatal due to rapid progression. in addition, no drug has been proven effective for covid-19. early interventions can be implemented for patients with more than five news points, who are expected to develop disease progression. first, since covid-19 is a highly contagious infectious disease, requiring medical staff to wear personal protective equipment, resulting in less contact with patients compared to other patients. due to these limitations, the discovery of worsening patients may be delayed. news allows intensive monitoring by selecting patients who are likely to progress with a critical illness. second, the use of a highflow nasal cannula (hfnc) or noninvasive ventilation (niv) can be considered in patients with ards with alveolar collapse or hypercapnia. by early identification of high-risk patients, these non-invasive measures can give patients a chance to recover. third, due to the nature of the pandemic, medical personnel, facilities, and equipment are often depleted. news can help to detect high-risk patients quickly and early, and thus save patients by emergency evacuation to locations where medical personnel, facilities and equipment are available.this study had several limitations. first, because it was a retrospective study conducted at a single centre with a relatively small number of covid-19 patients, the results cannot be generalised. external validation is needed with studies on future large cohorts of covid-19 patients to confirm the efficacy of news for predicting poor clinical outcomes. second, the efficacy of the former sofa was not assessed. because contact with covid-19 patients is challenging, obtaining arterial blood gas analyses for measuring pao 2 /fio 2 ratios was not feasible for some patients. third, selection bias cannot be avoided. we did not use data from a large population and the severity of covid-19 may differ among hospitals and between countries. however, a strength of our study is that it was the first to evaluate the efficacy of preexisting scoring systems for the prediction of clinical deterioration in covid-19 patients.in conclusion, calculation of the news at the time of hospital admission can predict critical clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19, and its predictive value is superior to that of sirs and qsofa. by early detection of the high-risk group using news, early interventions for high-risk patients can improve clinical outcomes in covid-19 patients.during the last two decades, coronaviruses have been recognized as one of the most critical human pathogenic viruses that affect global health and cause concern in the world health system. 1 coronavirus is classified into four genera: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. major (about 4% mortality). 8 there is no vaccine or targeted treatment currently available for covid-19 infection. treatment is mostly supportive, although multiple experimental antiviral medications are being evaluated. 9, 10 thus, prevention and rapid diagnosis of infected patients are crucial. the trigger for rapid screening and treatment of covid-19 patients is based on clinical symptoms, laboratory, and radiographic findings that are similar to sars and mers infections.in this study, we attempted to distinguish the clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, radiographic signs, and outcomes of confirmed covid-19, sars, and mers patients. all findings are compared to determine unique features among each of them. these data could be helpful in the early diagnosis and prevention of infection as well as providing more reliable epidemiological data on a large-scale for health care policies and future studies.this study was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement (prisma) guidelines, and it has been registered in the prospero database (id 176106). 11 we searched all studies published up to 28 february 2020, from the following databases: embase, scopus, pubmed, web of science, and the cochrane library. search medical subject headings (mesh) terms used were: "covid-19," "coronavirus," "severe acute respiratory syndrome," "sars virus," "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "coronavirus infections," "middle east respiratory syndromecoronavirus," and all their synonyms like "wuhan coronavirus,""sars-cov-2," and "covid-19," "2019-ncov" and mers. moreover, we searched for unpublished and grey literature with google scholar, centre for disease controls (cdc) and who databases.we also examined references of included articles to find additional relevant studies. there was no language restriction, and all included studies were written in english or chinese languages; the latter was translated by https://translate.google.com/. additional search strategy details are provided in table s1 .duplicate studies were removed using endnote x7 (thomson reuters, new york, ny, usa). records were initially screened by title and abstract by independently four authors (ap, sg, ak, and rf). the full-text of potentially eligible records was retrieved and examined, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.studies had to fulfill the following predetermined criteria to be eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. all case-control, cross-sectional, cohort studies, case reports, and case series peer-reviewed studies were included if they reported the number of confirmed cases of patients with demographic data, [and] [or] clinical data, [and] [or] laboratory data, [and] [or] risk factor data.studies were excluded if they did not report the number of confirmed cases. letters to the editor, individual case reports, review articles, and news reports were also excluded. duplicate information from the same patient was combined and counted as a single case when the data was reported twice.all covid-19 included publications were published in 2020, and all patients were from china. the following items were extracted from each article: first author, center and study location in china, countries, sample collection time, patient follow-up time, the reference standard for infection confirmation, number of confirmed cases, study type, and all demographic, clinical, laboratory data, and risk factor data. three of our authors (sg, ak, and rf) independently extracted data, and all extracted data were checked randomly by another author (ap); differences were resolved by consensus.quality assessments of studies were performed by two reviewers independently according to the critical appraisal checklist recommended by the joanna briggs institute, 12 and disagreements were resolved by consensus. the checklist is composed of nine questions that reviewers addressed for each study. the "yes" answer to each question received one point. thus, the final scores for each study could range from zero to nine (table s2 ).data cleaning and preparation were done in microsoft excel 2010 (microsoft©, redmond, wa, usa), and further analyses were carried out via comprehensive meta-analysis software version 2.0 (biostat, englewood, nj). determination of heterogeneity among the studies was undertaken using the chi-squared test (cochran's q) to assess the appropriateness of pooling data. depending on the heterogeneity test, we used either random or fixed-effect models for pooled results. in the case of high heterogeneity (i2 > 50%), a random effect model (m-h heterogeneity) was applied, while in low heterogeneity cases (i2 < 50%), a fixed-effect model was used. 13 percentages and means ± sds were calculated to describe the distributions of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. p values reflect study heterogeneity with <.05 being significant. we also used the funnel plot, begg's, and egger's tests based on the symmetry assumption to detect publication bias ( figure s1 ). the process of study selection is displayed in figure 1 quality assessment of included studies was performed based on the critical appraisal checklist, and the final quality scores of the included studies are represented in table s2 . in brief, studies by chen et al, 14 wang et al, 17 huang et al, 18 guan et al, 19 zhang et al, 24 cheng et al, 25 li et al, 28 xu et al, 30 figure s2 ). cough was the second most common symptom presenting in covid-19 63% (95% ci 55.5-70, p < .001), sars 54.2%(95% ci 49-59, p < .001), and mers 61% (95% ci 51-70, p < .001) of patients ( figure s3 ). age is an exception, presented in mean age in years.(95% ci 2.7-13, p < .001), or runny nose 6% (95% ci 1-14, p < .001). more detail information about demographics and clinical characterization of covid-19 (table s3) , sars (table s4) , and mers patients (table s5 ) demonstrated in the supplementary material.the greatest risk for covid-19 patients 69.5% (95% ci 54.5-81, p < .001) up to 28 february 2020, is a history of recent travel to wuhan, contact with people from wuhan, or were wuhan residents, and 24.3% (95% ci 9.6-49, p < .001) had exposure at the seafood market(s (table s9) , sars (table s10) , and mers patients (table s11) is demonstrated in the supplementary material.most covid-19 confirmed patients required hospitalization 85.4% (95% ci 68-94, p < .001) and 20.6% (95% ci 6.7-48, p < .001) were deemed to be in critical condition. the mortality rate of covid-19 confirmed cases was 5.6% (95% ci 2.5-12.5, p < .001), sars 13% (95% 9-17, p < .001), and mers 35% (95% ci 31-39, p < .001) (figure 2 ).the laboratory findings showed that among a subset of patients 4.5% increased the percentage value. the actual mortality rate from covid-19 is almost certainly much lower than that found in this study. as more data emerges from screening asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals in china and around the world, the exact mortality rate will be better understood.among covid-19, sars, and mers patients, leukocytosis was found in 13.3%, 28%, and 30%, respectively, and leukopenia in 26%, 32%, and 41%, respectively.most of the patients with coronavirus had abnormal chest radiological findings. on the other hand, runny nose and rhinorrhea are less common symptoms in coronavirus-infected patients, 127 and that it is typically expressed on pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. 128 another study reported that following covid-19 infection deregulated cytokine/chemokine response and higher virus titer causes an inflammatory cytokine storm with lung immunopathological injury. 129 inflammation related to the cytokine storm in the lungs may then spread throughout the body via the circulation system.covid-19 patients have been reported to have increased plasma concentration of inflammation-related cytokines, including interleukin (il)-2,6,7,10, tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein i (mcp-i) especially in moribund patients. 130 several limitations of this study exist. publication bias and study heterogeneity are unavoidable in this type of study. therefore, it should be considered when interpreting the outcomes of the reports and our final data set. furthermore, this study likely overestimates disease severity due to a lack of screening for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals and subsequent publication bias related to these factors.likely, many infected persons have not been detected, thus falsely elevating the rates of hospitalization, critical condition, and mortality. the lower quality analysis and reporting in some of the included publications is another limitation of the study. to prevent language bias, we included reports in languages other than english. additionally, we searched for a variety of sites and databases to prevent internet platform bias. usingegger's regression test, we did not find significant publication bias. journal bias is an issue facing those who carry out a meta-analysis, yet it does not usually affect the general conclusions. 132 however, we cannot reject the occurrence of other biases in this study, such as choice bias, since several journals are not indexed in embase, scopus, pubmed, web of science, and the cochrane library and unpublished data from some regions of the world.fever and cough are the most common symptoms of covid-19-, sars-, and mers-infected patients. the mortality rate in covid-19confirmed cases was lower than sars-and mers-infected patients.clinical outcomes and findings may be biased by reporting only confirmed cases, and it should be considered when interpreting the data.coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has caused significant mortality and has been declared as a global pandemic by the world health organization the infection mainly presents as fever, cough, and breathing difficulty, and few patients develop very severe symptoms the purpose of this review is to analyze the impact of the virus on the kidney covid-19 infection causes acute kidney injury (aki) and is an independent risk factor for mortality angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors, direct viral damage, and immune-mediated damage play important roles in the pathogenesis aki in covid-19 infection could be from the synergistic effect of virus-induced direct cytotropic effect and cytokine-induced systemic inflammatory response aki caused in the viral infection has been analyzed from the available epidemiological studies the proportion of patients developing aki is significantly higher when they develop severe disease continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt) is the most used blood purification technique when needed the impact of covid-19 infection on chronic kidney disease (ckd) and renal transplant patients is also discussed in the manuscript no vaccine has been developed against the 2019-ncov virus to date the critical aspect of management is supportive care several investigative drugs have been studied, drugs approved for other indications have been used, and several clinical trials are underway across the globe recently remdesivir has received emergency use authorization by the food and drug administration (fda) in the usa for use in patients hospitalized with covid-19 prevention of the infection holds the key to management the patients with underlying kidney problems and renal transplant patients are vulnerable to developing covid-19 infectioncovid-19 pandemic causing acute kidney injury and impact on patients with chronic kidney disease and renal transplantationa series of pneumonia cases from unexplained etiology in wuhan, china, since december 2019 has created the public health concern and resulted in the identification of the viral cause. the initial reports of this viral infection were traced to the huanan seafood market, wuhan, china, and the etiological agent was identified as coronavirus [1] . the world health organization (who) has named the virus as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) on january 12, 2020 and has declared as public health emergency globally on january 30, 2020 [2] . the disease caused by the virus was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) on february 11, 2020 [3] . the international committee on taxonomy of viruses designated the etiological coronavirus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) [4] . the number of cases has been multiplying at an alarming rate globally, resulting in mortality, and who has declared covid-19 as pandemic on march 11, 2020 [5] . on may 2, 2020, there were 3.4 million confirmed cases of covid-19 infection cases globally, and the number of reported deaths were 244,213 [6] .after sars and middle eastern respiratory syndrome (mers), covid-19 is the third known zoonotic cov infection, and all belong to the beta-cov cluster [1] . there was no determination on the animal species carrying the ncov. the preliminary studies showed that the ncov is closely related to adapa et al j clin med res. 2020;12(6):352-361 the coronavirus isolated from bats, postulating the theory of possible transmission from bats to humans [1] . the genome homology sequence of sars-ncov and sars-cov was 79.5%, and sars-ncov had high homology with bat cov [7] . all the studies suggest the evidence strongly that the sars-ncov might have originated from the bats, the intermediate host in transmission to humans yet to be ascertained. ji et al have found that snakes are the wildlife repositories for the sars-ncov [8] .various studies have reported the epidemiological data on sars-ncov. most of the studies have shown that elderly patients are affected, higher male preponderance, and mortality is higher in the elderly with severe comorbid conditions [9] . the case fatality rate was estimated at 14-15%, depending on the case series described [9, 10] . the median incubation period is 14 days, and the median time from the first symptom to death is less in the elderly [1] . mode of transmission is through close contact with people who has an infection through respiratory droplets when the infected person coughs or sneezes. another possible mechanism is through infected surfaces and objects.epidemiological data revealed the severe illness rate of cov-id-19 infection is as high as 25%, and even though the lungs are the main organs affected, the kidney is also one of the main organs affected in severe illness [11] . acute kidney injury (aki) was seen in 5-15% of the cases infected with sars-cov and mers-cov, and had a higher mortality rate of 60-90% as per the literature [12] . covid-19 infection causes aki and is an independent risk factor for mortality [13, 14] . it also impacts patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd), patients on chronic replacement therapies, and patients with a kidney transplant. mohamed et al [15] evaluated the contributing factors for developing aki in 161 intensive care unit (icu) patients. in this study incidence of aki was 28%. approximately 35% of the patients who developed aki had a history of ckd stages 3 -5. twenty-eight percent of the patients with ckd stages 3 -5 had no aki [15] .after the sars-cov2 spike (s) protein attaches to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors, the s protein is cleaved and activated by transmembrane serine proteases family (tmprss), which allows the virus to release fusion peptide that aids in the membrane fusion [16] .aki in covid-19 infection could be from the synergistic effect of virus-induced direct cytotropic effect and cytokineinduced systemic inflammatory response. aki is more pronounced in patients with severe disease, acute respiratory dis-tress syndrome (ards), and those needing icu admission. other possible mechanisms of aki could be from acute tubular necrosis (atn) due to multiorgan failure and shock, and possible prerenal etiology from volume depletion secondary to decreased oral intake and high fever. drug toxicity, hemodynamic insult, and contrast exposure can also play a role. the workup for aki in covid-19 infection should be similar to the other causes of aki. mohamed et al [15] discussed different etiologies of aki in their study which include ischemic acute tubular injury, toxic acute tubular injury or combination of both, acute interstitial nephritis, de novo glomerular disease, pre-renal azotemia, and unspecified reasons. the contributing factors to different etiologies include hypotension, shock, rapid atrial fibrillation, prolonged volume depletion, rhabdomyolysis, toxic agents such as vancomycin, and iodinated contrast, overt proteinuria [15] .prior studies have shown that positive sars-cov ribonucleic acid (rna) polymerase gene fragments were detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in kidney specimens of autopsy patients died from sars [17] . mers-cov infections also have been shown to cause kidney epithelial cell damage by apoptosis mediated through receptors [18] . these studies suggest that the injury from coronavirus is a direct cytotoxic effect on kidney epithelial cells. diao et al analyzed the kidney tissue in six patients on autopsy; immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid (np) protein in the kidney tubule, possibly related to potential direct tubular injury from the virus [19] . the sars-cov-2 rna was detected in the urine of the patients by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) [20] .the normal human lung has type 1 and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells, which express ace2 and is expressed in 83% of type 2 cells. men have a higher expression rate of ace2 levels compared to women, and similarly, asians express higher ace2 levels compared to white and african american populations [1] . the analysis by xu et al found that ace2 receptor expression in the kidney is no less than the lung on comparative analysis [16] . podocytes and proximal convoluted tubule cells significantly co-express ace2 and tmprss genes that are potential targets for sars-cov-2. the kidney tissue expresses the ace2 gene higher than that of lung tissue. the binding affinity of sars-cov-2 to ace2 receptors is 10 -20 times higher than sars-cov as described by wrapp and colleagues [21] .the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in cov-id-19 infection and probable activation of t-cell response [9] . the possible occurrence of cytokine storm in severe cases is evidenced by the significantly higher cytokine levels. in the cytokine storm, the immune system damages healthy tissues rather than sars-cov-2 [16] . on the autopsies of six kidney tissues, the light microscopy revealed cluster of differentiation 68 (cd68) + macrophage infiltration of the tubulointerstitium and severe atn. the tubules showed complement 5b-9 deposition in all six cases, but deposition in glomeruli and capillaries were seldom seen. some cd8 + t lymphocyte cells and cd56 + (natural killer) cells were seen in kidney tissue [19] .recently published studies in china showed that the incidence of aki in patients infected with covid-19 is around 3-15% [22, 23] . in patients with severe covid-19 infection in icu, the rates of aki increased significantly to 14.5-50% [23, 24] . the variation in reporting the incidence of aki depends on the number of patients, severity of infection, and reporting of aki across the studies. the diagnosis of aki based on kidney disease improving global outcomes (kdigo) classification was summarized in table 1 [25] .cheng and colleagues analyzed a large cohort of 710 patients for kidney disease with confirmed covid-19 admitted to tongji hospital from january 28, 2020 to february 11, 2020 [22] . all the patients were above 18 years of age. patients who have a history of renal transplant and on maintenance dialysis were excluded from the study. the baseline serum creatinine was elevated in 110 patients on admission. the patients in the elevated serum creatinine group were elderly, had a higher percentage of males, and the days from onset of illness to hospital admission were shorter. these patients also had severe disease and co-morbidities compared to those with normal baseline serum creatinine. these patients had more pronounced aki and higher rates of mechanical ventilation, and the hospital mortality rate was higher.patients with elevated serum creatinine also had leukocytosis, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, and higher d-dimer levels. the patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine had a higher percentage of increased procalcitonin, aspartate aminotrans-ferase, and lactic dehydrogenase levels.most of the aki occurred within 7 days, but was much quicker and severe in elevated baseline serum creatinine group. patients with normal baseline creatinine had later onset of aki and recovered quickly. there was elevated blood urea nitrogen (bun), creatinine, high-grade proteinuria, and hematuria in elevated baseline serum creatinine patients along with significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr). there was a significant gap between peak and baseline creatinine in the elevated serum creatinine group. patients with elevated serum creatinine from baseline had worse outcomes compared to patients with normal baseline serum creatinine.the study by li et al [14] analyzed 59 cases of inpatients from multiple hospitals around wuhan from january 21, 2020 to february 7, 2020 with covid-19 disease, and 28 patients were diagnosed with severe cases according to the chinese nation health guidance. three of the patients died in the severe cases [14] . proteinuria was present in 63% of the patients, and many of them had detected protein on the first day of admission, suggesting the presence of prior renal impairment. bun was elevated in 27% of the patients, and an also higher level of bun was present in two patients who died. serum creatinine was elevated in 19% of the patients, and the patients who died had extremely high levels. the density was reduced on the computed tomography (ct) images of the kidney suggestive of edema and inflammation.in a study by wang et al [26] , the patients needing icu admission had higher bun and creatinine levels at hospital admission compared to non-icu admission patients and overall patients in general. the bun and creatinine levels continued to get worse in non-survivors until the death [26] .we summarized the finding from multiple studies including patient characteristics, co-morbidities, incidence of aki in general as well as icu/severely ill patients, number of patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) and mortality in table 2 [9-11, 13, 19, 22-24, 26-32] .in the patients who developed aki from covid-19 infection, around 1.5-9% of them required rrt in the form of crrt [26, 28] . the proportion of patients needing rrt increased to 5.2-25% with severe infection [11, 27] . as per the international experts, in severe covid-19 cases with hypoxemic respira- tory failure along with renal or liver dysfunction, ecmo with or without crrt, can be used. crrt is the most used blood purification modality in clinical practice, but for severe cov-id-19 patients with sepsis and ards, hemoperfusion/plasma adsorption treatment can also be selected to clear more inflammatory mediators [33] .recommendations on the care of hospitalized patients with covid-19 and kidney failure needing rrt from the american society of nephrology (asn) was summarized below [34].all the health care personnel should follow the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc)-recommended personal protective equipment (ppe) and safety guidelines during their interactions with the patients. all the health care personnel should work as a team to limit the exposure to the infection. indications for rrt are similar to other patients with aki, and providers with significant expertise should place dialysis catheters.the patients should be cohorted in dedicated icus, if possible. the preferred dialysis modality is crrt or slow, low-efficiency dialysis (sled) if available. intermittent hemodialysis (ihd) can also be performed if crrt and sled are not available. crrt is preferred over ihd in the setting of isolation, as ihd needs one-on-one nursing support. the patients needing crrt exceeds the machines available, prolonged intermittent treatments (e.g., 10 h instead of continuous) with higher flow rates (e.g., 40 -50 ml/kg/h) and after terminal cleaning, can be used for another patient.the patients should be cohorted on the dedicated floor, if possible. patients with active or suspected covid-19 needing dialysis treatment should not be transported to a central acute dialysis unit. ihd should be provided with one-on-one nursing care if the patient is in negative pressure room. if all the cov-id-19 patients are isolated on one floor, one dialysis nurse may be able to monitor two or three patients during ihd if video/ electronic monitoring is available. the nurse enters the room if the patient needs anything or to troubleshoot the machine. the peritoneal dialysis can be continued as automated peritoneal dialysis (apd) to limit the exposure of medical staff.the dialysis equipment should be cleaned with the disinfectant before removing it from the room. hospital infection control and policy directs the proper disposable of rrt machine equipment. as per the hospital protocol, crrt filters need to be changed every 72 h or longer.continuous venovenous hemofiltration, also known as cvvh or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (cv-vhdf) are the preferred techniques. in the usa, continuous venovenous hemodialysis (cvvhd) is the most common modality used. volume overloaded patients can be treated using slow continuous ultra-filtration (scuf) to keep fluid balance net negative [35] .temporary dialysis catheters are recommended for the vascular access and the providers with significant expertise should place dialysis catheters. it is recommended to use double-layered protection for the personnel performing the procedure. filters with high ultrafiltration coefficient and high molecular weight cut-off membrane with 8 -10 nm membrane pore size are suggested [36] . this would help in clearing high molecular weight inflammatory mediators. however, albumin would need to be replaced as it can be removed concurrently. it is essential to assess the patient's bleeding risk before choosing anti-coagulation. patients with severe covid-19 infection having high bleeding risk, it is recommended to avoid anticoagulation. in normal or hypercoagulable states, one can use heparin or citrate-based anticoagulation depending on hospital protocols. when using crrt in combination with ecmo, anticoagulation is not needed as ecmo utilizes systemic heparinization [35] .it is essential to pay a very close attention to hemodynamics and volume status of patients with covid-19 infection by using arterial and central venous pressure (cvp) monitors. patients should have frequent renal panels checks every 4 -6 h and monitor strict input and output to maintain a net negative fluid balance in ards patients. in patients without ards, the volume status should be assessed to maintain in euvolemic state.the patients should be monitored for recovery of kidney function on daily basis, and the rrt should be discontinued once the patient is non-oliguric, euvolemic and improved ventilation requirements. this should also be supported by improved laboratory findings without alarming electrolyte or acid-base imbalance.aki was associated with increased in-hospital mortality, so the patient should be meticulously managed by providing hemodynamic support, avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), nephrotoxins, and contrast. early institution of crrt will improve the outcomes. proteinuria and hematuria were also associated with in-hospital mortality, so close attention should be paid to urine analysis, both in-patient and out-patient settings.the experience from various published studies on patients infected with covid-19 infection showed that aki is associ-covid-19 pandemic and kidney injury j clin med res. 2020;12(6):352-361 ated with mortality. shi et al analyzed 101 patients who died from covid-19 infection showed that 23% had aki and 11% of patient had underlying ckd. bun and myoglogin levels were higher in patients who died within 3 days and median time from hospitalization to death is 4 days [37] . cheng in his analysis showed that elevated baseline serum creatinine, elevated bun, peak serum creatinine > 1.5, proteinuria, hematuria, aki stages 2 and 3 are all associated with mortality after adjusting for confounding factors [22] .the impact of covid-19 infection on ckd has not been reported. the incidence of known ckd patients varied from 0.7-47.6%, depending upon the series described [27, 29] . there was increased mortality in patients described in one study [29] . the incidence of aki was higher in patients with established ckd [22] .the studies analyzed the kidney function in patients admitted with confirmed covid-19 infection revealed the incidence of proteinuria and hematuria [14, 22] . a significant number of patients had proteinuria on the day of admission, which could be related to the cytotropic effects of the virus on the podocytes. proteinuria may result from direct podocyte injury from an expression of ace2 [16] .the patients who recovered from the covid-19 infection with proteinuria and hematuria need to be followed closely for the resolution. the patients who have sustained aki during the infection need to be monitored for ckd.the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 has amassed great concern worldwide, but its influence on transplant recipients is unknown. previously experienced coronavirus outbreaks have taught us that transplant recipients can be easily affected by these infections [38, 39] . with this being said, very little is known about the risk of the donor to receive transmission of the disease. several factors concerning donor exposure like infectivity, incubation period, etc., can play an important role. although there are no strict guidelines about donor restrictions, it would be advisable for potential donors to hold off on organ donation if suffering from a respiratory illness. the american red cross and european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) recommend 28-day and 21-day period delay respectively for potential organ donors with a history of recent travel to high-risk areas or contact with a person with suspected or proven coivd-19 [40, 41] . the ecdc recommends a 28-day delay after recovery from a confirmed infection. michaels and colleagues recently well described possible risks associated with transplants in covid-19-positive recipients [42] . andrea et al from italy described in their experience that in their institution, they have been limiting liver transplantation to the most urgent cases for the residents in the epidemic area [43] .a more liberal allocation policy is used for patients out-side epidemic areas. however, all recipients are screened to avoid transplantation in sars-cov-2-positive subjects. the internal board consistently reviews and updates the transplant list every 2 weeks according to the new insights on covid-19. they continuously train their healthcare providers and screen them with nasopharyngeal swabs at frequent intervals. providing timely information to patients and their caregivers to raise awareness and at the same time to avoid panic and confusion is important [43] .as per the review of the literature to the best of our knowledge, only one case of covid-19 infection has been described in kidney transplant recipients of 12 years [44] . the patient was successfully managed initially with the cessation of all immunosuppression. he was given intravenous stress dose steroids to prevent adrenal insufficiency. once the patient improved clinically, immunosuppression was resumed gradually. the overall clinical characteristics, including the symptoms, radiological findings on lung imaging, and laboratory findings, were similar to those of other non-transplanted adult patients with covid-19 pneumonia. this being the only case reported so far, it is difficult to say that it is not possible to see atypical findings or more severe presentations of covid-19 disease in transplant recipients.healthcare providers should be aware of that the experimental drugs like remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir could cause drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors [42] . it is therefore recommended to use these drugs with extreme caution. regarding the treatment of kidney transplant recipients with covid-19 infection, there is not much information available to help guide therapy and immunosuppression regimens. for now, it would be recommended to use due diligence and tailor management and treatment options based on the patient's clinical status, duration of transplant, and severity of illness. as the pandemic progresses, we now expect that we will have more information available for guidance.no vaccine has been developed against the sars-cov-2 virus to date. the critical aspect of management is supportive care. multiple treatments such as empiric antibiotics, antiviral therapy, and systemic corticosteroids have been used worldwide. several investigative drugs have been studied, drugs approved for other indications have been used, and several clinical trials are underway all across the globe.one of the most promising of these therapies is remdesivir. it inhibits viral replication by premature termination of rna transcription, and has shown activity against beta coronaviruses and in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 [45] . it has received emergency use authorization by the food and drug administration (fda) in the usa for use in patients hospitalized with covid-19. it is recommended for 5 days in patients who are not on mechanical ventilation or ecmo, and recommended for 10 days in patients who are on mechanical ventilation or ecmo [46] . it is not recommended in patients with lower gfr (gfr < 30 ml/min) [47] .others drug that has gained more attention was chloro- quine, hydroxychloroquine either alone or in combination with azithromycin. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine both have in vitro activity against sars-cov-2 [45] . they are both used in several countries for treating covid-19 infection based on anecdotal data and in-vitro studies. there was a news report from china, where chloroquine increased viral clearance, decreased disease progression, and improved radiological findings [47, 48] . there was another clinical trial reported from france, which is a non-randomized open-label trial of 36 patients compared to hydroxychloroquine or a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin versus standard of care in the control group. the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in six patients resulted in superior viral clearance compared with hydroxychloroquine monotherapy [49] . there was a recent study among 368 veterans, which found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine but associated with more risks due to its side effect profile [50] . these medications should be used with caution in patients with renal and hepatic impairment, and they can cause qt prolongation in the electrocardiogram. hydroxychloroquine use for pre and post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment for sars-cov-2 infection is currently under investigation. several clinical trials are planned in the usa to test the usage of hydroxychloroquine for treatment and prophylaxis for covid-19. clinicians are using different doses of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis and treatment.a recent clinical trial in china did not show the efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir for the treatment of pneumonia for cov-id-19 patients, but this trial was underpowered [30] . who launched a global mega trial called solidarity of four most promising coronavirus treatments (remdesivir; chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; ritonavir/lopinavir; ritonavir/ lopinavir and interferon beta) [51] .when antiretroviral medications for coronavirus treatment are used like lopinavir and ritonavir, dose adjustments to medications during crrt are not needed, as they are 90% protein bound. particular attention should be paid to the dosing of the drugs.other drugs are interferon beta, interferon alpha, mefloquine, favipiravir, darunavir, ribavirin, umifenovir, tocilizumab, and type ii transmembrane serine protease (tmspss2) inhibitors. support to therapies using vitamin a, b, c, d, e, thymosin alpha 1, thymopentin, selenium, zinc and pyrithione combination have been used for treatment against sars-cov-2 infection [47, 52] .covid-19 infection is spreading rapidly and causing mortality daily worldwide. unfortunately, knowledge about the novel virus is limited, and it causes a significant clinical threat to the general population and healthcare workers. several countries have imposed strict regulations on the public to limit the spread of the virus. many government agencies like cdc, fda, and hospitals, public health systems are working every day in the usa to contain the spread of infection.studies have shown that there is the involvement of kidneys with covid-19 infection and can be associated with high mortality. health care providers should recognize this aspect early, and appropriate management should be instituted as soon as possible. the patients with underlying kidney problems and renal transplant patients are vulnerable to developing covid-19 infection.there is limited understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, virulence of the virus at this moment, so prevention is the critical aspect in the management. several vaccines and promising treatments are undergoing clinical trials with the hope of finding a cure for this global crisis soon. coronaviruses are rna viruses which usually cause mild upper respiratory illnesses. the emergence of sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) mers (middle east respiratory syndrome) has focussed global attention on the clinical significance of cornaviruses.the current middle east respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus (mers-cov) was first isolated in june 2012 from the respiratory tract of a businessman in the bisha area of saudi arabia, who subsequently died of pneumonia and renal failure. 1 as of 28 july 2013 mers-cov has caused 91 laboratory confirmed cases and 46 deaths, representing a high case fatality rate of 50%. 2 the high case fatality rate is likely related to the pattern of the disease as we probably are seeing only the tip of the iceberg of critically ill and admitted patients. the high fatality rate is likely to decline as milder clinical cases emerge. similar to sars, common symptoms in patients with mers-cov include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms. most patients have had pneumonia and the majority was reported to have multiple co-morbid conditions. 3, 4 the rapid deployment of effective therapeutics is a high priority as there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine for mers-cov. the clinical experience from sars suggests that a number of interventions including ribavirin with and without corticosteroids, interferon alfa with corticosteroids, ribavirin with lopinavir and ritonavir, and convalescent plasma may improve the outcome in patients but the data are not conclusive. 5 the purpose of this review is first to summarize the effectiveness of these treatments, in an attempt to identify a therapeutic approach that could help select the most appropriate therapeutic options for patients with mers-cov infections.the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) has been detected in a number of countries in the middle east and europe with an apparently high mortality rate. it is phylogenetically related to the sars coronavirus and has also been associated with severe respiratory illness as well as nosocomial transmission in healthcare settings. current international recommendations do not support any specific therapies; however, there are a number of agents, which were used during the sars epidemic of 2003. it is possible that these might be active against the related mers coronavirus. we have reviewed the literature on the safety and efficacy of therapies used in patients with sars with a view to their potential use in patients with mers-cov infections.ß 2013 international society for infectious diseases. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved. inconclusive. there was no mention of the total number of respondents. it is rather surprising that patients with long treatment delay had a good response. this is partly related to that the allocation to different regimens was not randomized and the criteria not described in the paper. parameters that influenced treatment response were time from symptom onset to treatment day (p=0.003), time from admission to treatment day (p=0.001), time to maximal radiographic score from treatment day (p=0 .001), maximal radiographic score (p=0.009), sao2 at maximal radiographic score (p= 0.13). or case series; agents included were ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir and ritonavir (lpv/r), and convalescent plasma. we exclude corticosteroid studies as this was beyond the scope of this review and the management of severe pneumonia has been well covered in the who guideline. 6 data extracted from these publications include: authors name, publication year, type of study, level of evidence, sample size, interventions dose, duration, indication, route, and time of administration, number of patients, and efficacy and safety outcome of these interventions. the outcomes of interest included mortality rate, measures of morbidity and adverse effects. the outcomes reported in the selected studies included death, mechanical ventilation, improvement of symptoms, admission to the intensive care unit, infectious complications, successful discharge and adverse effects.the clinical studies were all critically appraised. aspects that were assessed included study design, the possibility of bias in the selection of the control group and treatment allocation, and whether the treatment regimen and reporting of outcomes were consistent. the studies were tabulated and summarized in a narrative way, and were grouped by the treatment strategy. we categorized each article depending on which drug was used. we tabulated results as type of study, dose, duration, time of administration, and indication of medication, number of patients included in that study, plus the final outcomes.the studies were scored using the us preventive services task force scoring system 7 , where level of evidence. loe, i: evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled trial. level ii-1: evidence obtained from well-designed controlled trials without randomization. level ii-2: evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control analytic studies, preferably from more than one center or research group. level ii-3: evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention. dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence. level iii: opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience, descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees.we identified 54 studies about sars or coronavirus and we included 19 studies only. we excluded 35 studies since 14 of them were in vitro studies, 15 corticosteroid studies, and 6 were nontherapeutic studies. overall, we analyzed 19 studies, nine used ribavirin alone or with interferon (table 1) [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , two used lopinavir and ritonavir (table 2) 17, 18 , six used convalescent plasma (table 3) [19] [20] [21] [22] , there was one study of interferon alpha (table 4) 23 and one study comparing interferon alpha versus ribavirin 13 . summaries of the different studies are presented in tables 1-4. there has been a lot of concern worldwide about the emergence of the mers-cov. although infection control, molecular diagnostics and international public health have improved considerably since the 2003 sars epidemic, there are still no proven or licensed therapies for any coronavirus infection. the high mortality associated with mers-cov led us to conduct this systematic review to summarize the available options for treatment for novel coronavirus infection based on previous reports of therapy of sars, a related coronavirus.the most commonly used agent was the broad spectrum antiviral ribavirin. there were seven reports of the use of ribavirin in sars patients although only four reported control groups. the mortality benefit was inconsistent with mortality rates of between 5% and 42.8%, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] two studies showed improvements of symptoms in 71.4%-80% of patients, and icu admission rates of 13%-20%. 8, 9 the major problem with ribavirin was the significant incidence of adverse events especially hemolysis which was reported in 68.5%. 10 the timing of the start of antiviral agents is important in most virus infections. one study compared oseltamivir versus ribavirin and showed no obvious response to ribavirin, however, the treatment were started after 10-14 days of symptoms which might have led to the poorer outcomes. 11 there was only one randomized controlled trial: this compared ribavirin versus interferon-1a and showed no advantage of ribavirin over interferon in patients with sars. 13 in addition, there were observational studies comparing interferon-1a with untreated controls. 23 interferon led to improvements in clinical and laboratory parameters compared with control patients. 23 however, there was no standard regime used and adverse events were not well documented.the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to ribavirin regimen was associated with improved clinical outcome and reduces the death rate comparing to ribavirin regimen alone in observational studies. 17, 18 these studies are detailed in table 2 .few studies addressed the effect of convalescent plasma. [19] [20] [21] [22] these studies were mainly case reports which limit the generalizability of their findings. in three studies of sars patients, patients the interferon alfacon-1 treatment group had a shorter time to 50% resolution of lung radiographic abnormalities (p =.001), had better oxygen saturation (p =.02), resolved their need for supplemental oxygen more rapidly ( p =.02), had less of an increase in creatine kinase levels (p =.03), and showed a trend toward more rapid resolution of lactate dehydrogenase levels compared with the group receiving corticosteroids alone. inconclusive and mechanical ventilation 21, 22 and lower mortality than the comparator group (0%-12.5% versus 17% 23.8%). 19, 21, 22 intriguingly, an in vitro study showed that convalescent plasma from sars patients might contain cross-reactive antibodies against other beta-coronavirus including mers-cov. 24 of 28 sera, 7 (25%) had antibodies anti-mers-cov neutralizing antibodies at low titers. 24 convalescent sera was recommended in a recent study by the international severe acute respiratory and emerging infection consortium (isaric). 25 cross-reactive antibodies may be present in convalescent plasma from sars patients against other betacoronavirus and may be associated with a better outcome, reduced mortality, and shorter hospital stay. [19] [20] [21] [22] there are considerable technical hurdles to overcome before convalescent sera can be widely recommended as a therapeutic agent in the modern era. currently, there is a need to establish a serology test to diagnose patients with mild disease and thus identify those patients as possible donors of convalescent sera.we conclude that the use of ribavirin may improve the outcome and reduce mortality as shown in a number of studies. one of the reasons for the failure of ribavirin in some reports may have been the timing for the use of ribavirin, after 6-14 days of symptom, 11, 14, 16 compared to studies which showed benefits when ribavirin was started within 48 hours of hospitalization or after diagnosis of sars was established. 8, 9, 12, 13 the major limitation of ribavarin is its significant toxicity at the doses used to treat patients with sars. although the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir to ribavirin appeared to have a better outcome in patients with sars. 17, 18 there are reports that lopinavir/ritonavir is not active in vitro against the mers-cov. 25 other in vitro studies have failed to yield potent therapeutic agents despite a search including dpp4 inhibitors. 26 among the limitations of this review are the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies in terms of the wide range of treatment dosages, frequency, and route of administration, duration, and timing of administration. the reported treatment effects should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of randomized, controlled trials.also, while we have drawn on the sars literature, and sars is a closely related virus, there are clearly differences between sars and the mers-cov and the data might not be able to be directly extrapolated to mers-cov infected patients. the use of the discussed agents would require monitoring hematological and biochemical parameters during treatment to detect and prevent adverse effects associated with therapy. possible dosages of discussed agents especially with unavailability of intravenous ribavarin are listed in table 5 . the table also includes the possible dosage of pegelated interferon-a (pegifn-a) that is commonly used in the treatment of hepatitis c virus infection. pegifn-a was 50-100 times more effective in vitro for mers-cov than sars-cov. 25 the long half-life of pegifn-a and the associated adverse effects calls for extra attention for the use of shorter-acting interferon. 25 the use of interferon therapy with ribavirin is not recommended in patients with hepatitis c virus infection and renal dysfunction (clcr <50 ml/minute).with the emergence of mers-cov and the lack of high quality clinical evidence to support recommendations for the use of available therapeutic options, there is a clear need for developing protocols to be used in randomized-controlled trials in order to determine the most effective therapies for this novel emerging pathogen.in wuhan city, the capital of hubei in december 2019 in china, an outbreak representing in pneumonia of unidentified origin had occurred. in 7 january 2020, scientists of china could isolate a new strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), from the affected patients, 1 that causes the disease; coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) as stated by who in february 2020. 2 although the outbreak mostly have started from a zoonotic transmission in a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became obvious that efficient person-to-person transmission was also possible. 3 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 disease appears to be wide, ranging from asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure or death. the evaluation of risk factors for the severity of the disease and possibility of death is a very important issue for prediction of the possible outcome.a study conducted by zhou et al 5 confirmed that increased age of patients with covid-19 was associated with death. the decrease in t-cell and b-cell functions depending on age and the additional production of type 2 cytokines, could lead to a lack in control of viral replication and load and more exacerbation in proinflammatory responses that may lead to increase the severity of the disease and poor outcome. 6 petrilli et al 7 described characteristics of 4103 patients in new york city with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 disease, 1999 of them needed hospital admission while 650 of them needed icu, respiratory support, were discharged to hospital and/or died. they found that older age was one of the most important predictors of hospitalization and a vital predictor of severe outcomes. nasiri et al 8 showed that sex affected the mortality rate, where the mortality of females with covid-19 was significantly lower than males [odds ratio (3.4); 95% ci 1.2-9.1, p value = (0.01)], on the other hand, there was not any significant difference between male and female regarding icu admissions. earlier coronavirus epidemics of sars and mers resulted in a similar form of higher mortality in males than females. karlberg et al 9 also showed that the difference in mortality rates according to sex distribution of the affected cases was higher in younger males (0-44 years old) (rr=2), compared to those of age group (45-74years old) (rr-1.45). also, another study conducted by alghamdi et al 10 showed that regarding mers, the number of diseases in males was double that of females (52% vs 23%).patients with coronary heart disease have also been found to have severe acute cardiac events and poor outcomes in respiratory viral infections including influenza. 11 a study conducted by zhou et al showed that increasing level of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i(ctni) during hospitalization was presented in more than half of cases who died with covid-19. 5 li et al 12 reported the clinical characteristics of 25 cases died with covid-19. the clinical profile of these patients showed that the most important risk factors for death in these patients represented in, age and underlying diseases. regarding the underlying diseases associated with death, the most recorded one was chronic hypertension then diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiac diseases, cerebral infarction, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumors and acute pancreatitis. li et al 12 demonstrated that respiratory failure was the leading cause of death in all the patients, which confirmed that lungs of the patients are the most important target organ of sars-cov-2. multiple organ failure could be observed in those patients, the heart came after the lung as the most common damaged organ then the kidney and the liver. the results of that study verified that the death of the patients with covid-19 may be to a large extent related to impaired cardiopulmonary function. all the patients' albumin levels, 80% and 68% of patients' rbc and hb levels were decreased, which indicates that malnutrition is one of the causes of severe covid-19.measures of inflammation process were found to be much more important than co-morbidities and demographic characteristics in the hospitalized patients with covid-19. 7 exaggerated inflammatory response were well defined as severe sepsis. 13 even though the extent of inflammation caused by covid-19 is similar to or different than that caused by sepsis is unknown. some case reports recommend that patients with critical covid-19 disease are showing complications from hypercoagulability, 5 as pulmonary emboli, 14 and microscopic thrombi. 15 so, it is notable that obesity was the chronic condition that had the strongest association with critical illness, with odds ratio higher than any other cardiovascular or pulmonary disease because obesity is recognized to be a pro-inflammatory condition. 16, 17 guan et al 18 observed that among patients with covid-19, the circulatory and endocrine co-morbidities were common. patients with one or more co-morbidities were associated with worse clinical outcomes. of the 1590 cases, 399 (25.1%) had at least one co-morbidity. the prevalence of specific co-morbidities was; hypertension (269; 16.9%), other cardiovascular diseases (53.7%), diabetes (130; 8.2%), cerebrovascular diseases (30; 1.9%), hepatitis b infections (28; 1.8%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (24; 1.5%), chronic kidney diseases (21; 1.3%), malignancy (18; 1.1%) and immunodeficiency (3; 0.2%). at least, single co-morbidity was commonly seen in severe cases than in non-severe cases (32.8% vs 10.3%).in hospitalized covid-19 patients, the prevalence of kidney impairment (abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction) was high. after adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment was related to higher risk of in-hospital mortality so; clinicians should increase their attention to kidney impairment in hospitalized covid-19 patients. early discovery and effective intervention of kidney impairment can help to reduce mortality of covid-19 patients in clinical practice. 19 petrilliet al. 7 reported particularly strong association of chronic kidney disease with the risk of hospitalization. also they declared the importance of hypoxia even with supplemental oxygen in distinguishing among patients who will develop critical illness and those who will not.blood picture of patients with covid-19 characterized by normal or low count of wbcs and decreased level of lymphocytes. 20 increased levels of wbcs and neutrophils were found in 68% and 72% of patients. similarly, elevation of procalcitonin (pct) levels were observed in 90.5% of patients. 12 d-dimers are fragments produced when plasmin cleaves fibrin to break down clots. they are routinely used to exclude the diagnosis of thrombosis. however, plasma d-dimer increases by any pathologic or non-pathologic process that increases fibrin production or breakdown. 21 a study conducted by zhou et al 5 found d-dimer more than 1 μg/ml is associated with mortality of covid-19. high levels of d-dimer have been associated with 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis or infection identified in the emergency department. 22 petrilli et al. 7 reported striking findings regarding the predictive value of inflammatory markers to distinguish future critical from non-critical illness. early elevation in d-dimer level had the strongest association with prolonged hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation or death. 7 many studies have reported that d-dimer levels are associated with severity and clinical outcome of community-acquired pneumonia. 23 the other mechanisms include the pro-inflammatory cytokine responses that considered one of the mediators of atherosclerosis disease that contribute to plaque rupture by the local inflammation, induce procoagulant factors, and haemodynamic changes, which trigger to thrombosis formation and ischemic diseases. 24 also, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace 2), that considered the receptor for sars-cov-2, is expressed on vascular endothelial cells and myocytes. 25 therefore, there is at least theoretical possibility of direct affection of the heart by the virus.c-reactive protein is a useful marker and gauge of inflammation; it plays an important role in host defense against invading pathogens as well as in inflammation. 26 early rise in the c-reactive protein also had the strongest association with mechanical ventilation or mortality. 7 serum amyloid a (saa) is a plasma protein that transports lipids during inflammation. 27 li et al 12 showed that the increased levels of saa and crp before death in 85% and 100% of patients, suggestive of that there is a serious inflammatory cascade in patients having covid-19. in intend to monitor biochemical indicators which are important in monitoring the severity of the disease and its progress, li et al 12 consulted the results of laboratory test for all the dead patients, among which 16patients had repeated measurements. the saa maintained a high level in all the patients, this result indicated that raised saa levels are closely related to the poor prognosis of patients. the first test level of neutrophils was (93.8%), crp (84.6%), pct (100%), ctni (88.9%), d-dimer (91.6%) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) (100%) were increased than the last test, but the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (87.5%), suggesting that the increasing of neutrophils, crp, d-dimer, pct, ctni, and ldh levels can be used as markers of disease severity and progress, similarly the decline of lymphocytes counts.nasiri et al 8 identified common laboratory findings associated with a poor outcome including lymphopenia (50.1%), raised c-reactive protein (72%), and increased levels of ldh (41%). also, thrombocytopenia was found in 11.1% of the cases. the studies performed by huang et al, 4 and lippi et al 28 have suggested that thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia in patients with covid-19 are associated with prolonged hospitalization and worse outcomes. patients with sars were indicated to have a higher percentage of lymphopenia (68-90%) and thrombocytopenia (20-45%) than those of covid-19. 29 thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia have been previously associated with a greater risk of mortality in sars and influenza. 30, 31 liver changes were one of the most common finding in the covid-19 infected subjects (13.3%). however, a significant ast rising was found in number of subjects (19.7%) also level of alt (14.6%). in some previous viral infections including sars, changes and impaired liver function have been noticed as collateral damage, perhaps caused by direct damaging of the hepatic tissue by the pathogen. 32 although this could be the same situation with covid19, an iatrogenic trauma because of medications as the used lopinavir in covid-19 therapy can play a role.the method and level of the virus replication and its duration of life are important factors in evaluating the root of transmission and guiding protocols for patients' protection and isolation. as coronavirus rna detection is more sensitive than the isolation of the virus itself, most studies gave care to use qualitative or quantitative viral rna tests as a possible marker for infectious coronavirus. about sars-cov, the viral rna was obtained from the respiratory specimens from about third of patients affected by the virus for at least 4 weeks from the onset of the disease. 33 the same regarding mers-cov rna, where the duration of viral detection in the lower respiratory specimens continued as long as 3 weeks. 34 a study conducted by zhou et al 5 found that duration of sars-cov-2 rna in survivors could reach for a median of 20 days even though it could still till death in non-survivors. this result has an important role in the decision of patient's isolation and guidelines regarding the length of treatment protocols. usually in serious influenza virus infection, continued viral replication was associated with worse outcome that may be fatal, also the delay in starting with suitable antiviral treatment had an important effect on viral replication and detection. 35 in patients with covid-19, the serum level of ferritin was significantly elevated in non-survivors compared with survivors during the clinical stages of the disease, and raised with case deterioration. 5 shoenfeldreported that the h-chain of the ferritin had a role in activating macrophages to raise the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. so, understanding of the pathogenesis of the hyperferritinemic syndrome including the infection with covid-19 became obvious. 36 many studies noted chest x-ray and ct abnormalities in their study populations including unilateral pneumonia, 38 bilateral pneumonia, 4,5,37-39 bilateral infiltrates, 40 and ground glass opacities. 5, 37, 39, 41, 42 cao et al found a mortality rate of 17/102 patients. they found that ground-glass opacity was associated with mortality, present in 41.2% of cases who died versus 12.9% of those who lived. 43 summary of the risk factors of critical illness and mortality predictors in covid-19 were presented in (figure 1 ).covid-19 is an emerging disease all over the world and spreading at an unpredicted rate, resulting in significant influences on global economies and public health. the present review assessed the risk factors related to the outcomes of sars-cov-2 infections which were included old age, male gender, and obesity, associated co-morbidities in the form of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, cerebrovascular diseases and copd. laboratory parameters associated with critical covid-19 disease were lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis, increased neutrophils, increased c reactive protein and ferritin, increased d dimer, raised alt and/or ast, decreased albumin, increased cardiac troponin and elevated ldh. finally, ground-glass opacities when present in the ct chest were considered as the most important imaging indicator for covid-19 severity.funding n/a.the authors report no conflicts of interest in this work. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) andhas led to a global pandemic with >2.9 million confirmed cases, including over 964,000 confirmed cases and 54,840 deaths in the unitedstates. 1 in the state of georgia, the first case of the novel coronavirus (covid-19) was detected on march 3, 2020, and the first death attributed to covid-19 was about 10 days later on march 12. as of april 24, there were 22,147 confirmed cases, 4221 patients hospitalized, and 892 deaths attributed to covid-19. 2 furthermore, it was forecasted that georgia will have >1620 deaths attributed to covid-19 between march 3 and june 1, 2020. 3hospital critical care capacity represents the most important medical care factor for preventing deaths from covid-19. understanding the geographic areas that have the highest disease burden and morbidity will allow policy makers, public health professionals, and critical care providers to appropriately allocate resources and adequately prepare for the disease pandemic for specific populations.here, we present the overall prevalence of confirmed covid-19 cases, overall mortality rates attributed to covid-19, and the bi-weekly incidence rates of confirmed covid-19 cases in georgia, stratified by counties.using counties as the units of analysis, we examined the geographic we calculated 3 measures of disease morbidity at the county level: (1) the bi-weekly confirmed case incidence rate per 100,000 population, we performed all statistical analysis using sas version 9.4 and executed all mapping using arcgis version 10.5. figure s1a ). counties with ≥50% male residents had 19% higher incidence rates (incidence rate ratio = 1.19; 95% ci = 1.13-1.25), when compared with counties with <50% male residents ( figure s2a ). among the 22,147 confirmed cases, 4221 (19.1%) were hospitalized and 892 died (4.0% confirmed case-fatality rate; 95% ci: 3.8-4.3%) due to complications from covid-19. we present the mortality rates of confirmed covid-19 per county in figure 2b . among counties with (table 1) , including counties with no deaths, in order to understand similarities or dissimilarities between counties yet to experience mortality from the disease.we observed that counties with the highest mortality rates nh-black residents had 2-fold higher mortality rates (mortality rate ratio = 2.08; 95% ci = 1.80-2.41) when compared with counties with <50% nh-black residents ( figure s1b ). counties with ≥50% male residents had 47% higher mortality rates (mortality rate ratio = 1.47; 95% ci = 1.18-1.84) when compared with counties with <50% male residents ( figure s2b ). increases of county-level incidence rates are both a function of true incidence and more widespread testing. we reported on the hospital critical care infrastructure by county using the number of icu beds and primary care physicians as proxies. we were unable to account for the number of available ventilator supplies. additionally, hospital critical care infrastructure is not static, and hospitals may have the capacity to increase staffing and icu bed space during the covid-19pandemic. however, urban centers may be more equipped to increase their critical care capacity than rural centers. a further limitation is that we lacked data on transfers of critically ill patients from rural areas to facilities in large urban areas.to date and to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to describe the epidemiology of covid-19 in the state of georgia, with geographic trends and elucidating possible county-level differences that are correlated with higher mortality rates. 8 in order to mitigate the burden and excess deaths due to covid-19, varying stakeholders including policymakers, politicians, medical professionals, and community leaders will need to strategize and appropriately allocate resources to these under-resourced areas.in georgia, the peak of the covid-19 pandemic was estimated to arrive in late april 2020. the state and local governments should strongly support rural counties and the southwestern georgia area by supplying increased icu beds, ventilators, and emergency medical staff. while urban centers in georgia account for the bulk of covid-19 cases, the high mortality rates and low critical care capacity in rural georgia is becoming a highly detrimental factor in fighting this pandemic. this is especially concerning, given hospital critical care capacity may be the most important medical system stopgap in terms of preventing/limiting deaths associated with covid-19.there are no conflicts to declare.justin xavier moore is responsible for conception,

coronavirus sars-cov-2 first emerged in december 2019 in wuhan, china and rapidly grew into a large-scale global pandemic. 1 tracking the severity and impact of is, at the time of writing, a critical need, hampered by testing issues and reporting lags for key epidemiological indicators.many countries, including the us, were caught off-guard by the speed with which covid-19 spread from china. without adequate capacity to test for the sars-cov-2 virus causing covid-19 for much of february and march 2020, available laboratory-confirmed cases captured only an estimated 10-15% of all infections. 2 although most countries have adopted the strategy to preferentially test severe cases, estimating the number of severe infections and deaths caused by covid-19 will be a challenge. typically, a large proportion of deaths caused by infectious diseases are not attributed to a specific pathogen. with the limited availability of testing for the novel coronavirus and imperfect sensitivity of the tests, 3, 4 there have undoubtedly been a number of deaths caused by the virus that are not counted in official tallies. even in situations of ample testing, deaths from viral pathogens, including sars-cov-2, can occur indirectly via secondary bacterial infections or exacerbation of chronic conditions. further, in the midst of a large outbreak, there is an unavoidable delay in compilation of death certificates and ascertainment of cause of deaths, which contributes to uncertainty about severity and burden.finally, in the us, there has been a high degree of variability in public health resources, laboratory testing, and recognition of the outbreak at the state level, which could lead to significant under-estimation of the true impact of the outbreak in certain geographies.to estimate the burden of death due to novel respiratory pathogens, previous studies have compared the observed incidence of influenza-related deaths ascribed to pneumonia and influenza ("p&i") with the baseline incidence of p&i that would be expected at that time of year. 5, 6 these "excess deaths" provide an estimate of pathogen-specific burden. this approach was used in the early months of the 2009 influenza a/h1n1-pdm pandemic; it is estimated that just 1 in 7 pandemic-related deaths was captured by laboratory testing in 2009 in the us. 7, 8 . cc-by 4.0 international license

(which was not certified by peer review)the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 18, 2020. .in this study, we estimated the increase in p&i deaths across the united states in each week in excess of a seasonal baseline to capture the direct and indirect mortality burden of covid-19.we compare these estimates of excess deaths to the reported numbers of deaths due to covid-19 in different states and evaluate the trajectories of these increases in relation to the volume of testing and to indicators of covid-19 morbidity. these analyses provide insights into the burden of covid-19 in the early months of the outbreak in the united states and serve as a surveillance platform that can be updated as new data accrue.data on deaths due to pneumonia and influenza (p&i, icd-10 codes j09-j18) and all-causes by state and week were obtained from the national center for health statistics' (nchs) mortality surveillance system. 9 here we analyze spikes in p&i mortality rather than straight pneumonia to be more comprehensive, as influenza-coded deaths do not necessarily require laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, there is overlap of symptoms between influenza and covid-19, and p&i mortality has been used in us to monitor the severity of influenza and other respiratory pathogens since the 1918 pandemic. in addition, analysis of spikes in all-cause mortality provides a full picture of the direct and indirect burden of covid-19.the nchs mortality data are available with a 2-week lag and are partially complete for the most recent weeks. the p&i mortality data provide the provisional number of deaths due to pneumonia or influenza (ie, deaths with a code of pneumonia or influenza anywhere in the death certificate) and should be adjusted by the total number of deaths reported in real time each week.connecticut, north carolina, and west virginia were missing mortality data for recent months and were therefore excluded from the analyses.the p&i grouping will include individuals who had a listed cause of death as covid-19 (along with a p&i code) as well as people who did not have covid-19 listed as a cause of death. it does not capture people who had covid-19 listed as a cause of death but did not have p&i recorded among the causes.. cc-by 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. (which was not certified by peer review)the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted april 18, 2020. .we also compiled data on covid-19-related morbidity to gauge the timing and intensity of the pandemic in different locations. influenza-like illness (ili) is a longstanding indicator of morbidity from acute respiratory pathogens, including sars-cov-2. weekly state-level ili data were obtained from the cdc's ilinet system 10 , which aggregates data from a network of outpatient providers. to adjust for activity of non sars-cov-2 respiratory pathogens, we used state-level data on laboratory-confirmed influenza activity from the cdc's national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system (nrevss) 11 . this dataset captures the number of tests performed for influenza and the number that were positive by week and state. the ili data provide the percent of visits to participating outpatient providers that were for ili. ilinet and nrevss data are available with a 1-week lag.the ili, nrevss, and mortality datasets were accessed through the cdc's fluview portal using the cdcfluview package in r. data from nchs, ilinet and nrevss were obtained for the weeks ending january 5, 2013 through march 28, 2020.to compare our burden estimates with official covid-19 tallies, we compiled weekly reports of laboratory-confirmed deaths due to covid-19 in each state from several sources, including the covid tracking project, 12 and nchs 13 . state-specific testing information was obtained was the covid tracking project 12 .the 9 largest states by population, and washington state, were analyzed individually. the remaining states for which we had data were grouped into the corresponding health regions defined by the us department of health and human services ("hhs regions"). we fit poisson regression models to the weekly state-level counts of reported deaths due to p&i from january 5, 2015 to february 8, 2020 (see supplement for details). the baseline was then projected forward until march 28, 2020. we adjusted for seasonality using harmonic variables and included yearto-year baseline variation. influenza activity was controlled for by adjusting for the percent of tests that were positive for influenza in the previous week. the 1-week lag between the testing data and the mortality data accounts for the delay influenza testing and death. the number of allcause deaths was used as a denominator. poisson 95% prediction intervals were estimated by sampling from the uncertainty distributions for the estimated model parameters. 14 .

deaths in each week from the observed number of deaths for the period february 9, 2020 to march 28, 2020. because reporting of deaths for recent weeks is incomplete, nchs calculates a 'completeness' score (between 0 and 1) based on the number of death reports that have been received from a state and the number expected from that state based on previous years. the excess deaths were divided by the completeness score for each week to get an estimate for excess cases, adjusted for reporting delays.to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates of excess mortality to the adjustment for influenza activity, we refit the regression excluding the influenza covariate. we also fit a model with the same structure to all-cause mortality (without a denominator). to get a measurement of outpatient visits related to covid-19, the same model was fit to data on influenza-like illness.the analyses were run using r v 3.6.1. all analysis scripts and archives of the data are available from https://github.com/weinbergerlab/excess_pi_covid results many states experienced a notable increase in the proportion of total deaths due to p&i starting in mid-march through march 28 compared to what would be expected based on the time of year and influenza activity (figure 1, figure 2 ). expressed as the relative increase above the baseline, these increases were particularly notable in new jersey, washington, new york, illinois, and georgia. the increase in new york was largely driven by spikes in new york city ( figure s1 ).in some states, such as florida and georgia, the increase in deaths due to p&i preceded the widespread adoption of testing for the novel coronavirus by several weeks (figure 3) . as a result, the increase in p&i preceded the first reported covid-19 deaths, and the excess p&i was greater than the number of reported covid-19 deaths each week. in contrast, in washington . cc-by 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who

deaths, excess p&i deaths, and the increase in testing.the timing of the epidemic varied across states. some states and regions that have not yet seen large increases in deaths are earlier in the epidemic, though there is some indication of sharp increases in outpatient visits for ili (eg, ohio, texas figure 4) . the increase in p&i mortality typically lags behind the increase in ili visits, so increases in excess p&i deaths might be expected in coming weeks.the degree of under-reporting in some states can be seen when comparing the estimated excess deaths due to p&i with the number of reported covid-19 cases through march 28 ( was agreement between the reported covid-19 deaths and the excess p&i deaths (figure 3 , figure s1 ). in michigan, the number of excess p&i deaths was notably lower than the number of reported covid-19 deaths, potentially reflecting reporting delays in the p&i data. overall, in the states we evaluated for the period from february 9 to march 28, 2020 there were 3101 (2769, 3433) excess p&i deaths, compared with 1958 reported deaths due to covid-19 from the covid tracking project. there were 2537 deaths due to covid-19 provisionally reported by nchs (for the entire u.s.) during this period.deaths due to p&i represent just a fraction of all deaths caused by covid-19. to highlight this, we compared increases in deaths due to any cause in new york and new jersey with increases in deaths due to p&i and reported deaths due to covid-19 ( figure s2 ). there were 2-3 times as many excess all-cause deaths as reported covid-19 deaths or excess p&i deaths. in new york city, this discrepancy was even more stark, with 3-4 times as many excess all-cause deaths as p&i deaths (figure s3) . the observation that excess p&i deaths underestimate the burden of covid-19 is born out in the nchs data, where fewer than half of the deaths recorded as being due to covid-19 had pneumonia listed as a cause of death. 13 the proportion of covid-19-coded deaths with a pneumonia diagnosis itself varies considerably by state (table s2) .in sensitivity analyses, we refit the seasonal baseline but did not adjust for influenza activity (table s3) , and we

s4) . these changes influence the specific estimates for some of the states with smaller increases but do not affect the overall pattern.mortality data are released weekly, and regularly-updated analyses are available at https://weinbergerlab.github.io/excess_pi_covid/.excess p&i mortality has been used as a method for tracking influenza mortality for more than a century. here we used a similar strategy to capture covid-19 deaths that had not been attributed specifically to the pandemic coronavirus. monitoring trends in broad mortality outcomes, like p&i or all-causes, provides a window into the magnitude of the mortality burden missed in official tallies of covid-19 deaths. given the lack of adequate testing and geographical variability in testing intensity, this type of monitoring provides key information on the severity of the epidemic in different geographic regions. it also provides some indication of the degree to which viral testing is missing deaths associated with covid-19 directly or indirectly. our findings suggest that the degree to which deaths due to covid-19 are being correctly attributed to sars-cov-2 varies by state. some states, such as florida and pennsylvania, might have missed deaths early on and might be undercounting deaths by a substantial degree currently. other states, like washington, have an accurate estimate of the mortality burden of the pandemic virus due to intense testing. and in states that have been hit hard by the pandemic virus, such as new jersey or new york, the total excess mortality burden is 2-3 times that ascribed to covid-19 in official statistics. together, these findings demonstrate that estimates of the death toll of covid-19 based on excess p&i and all-cause mortality will be more reliable than those relying only on reported deaths, particularly in places that lack widespread testing.local epidemics of covid-19 started at different times across the us. states with early epidemics, like new york and new jersey, are now reporting large increases in both p&i and all-cause mortality. other states that had later epidemic onsets are just now entering the period of rapid growth of deaths. because some states instituted social distancing measures at an earlier phase of the epidemic, they might benefit more from reducing the intensity of the peak in deaths.syndromic endpoints, such as deaths due to p&i, outpatient visits for ili, and emergency department visits for fever, can provide a crude but informative measure of the progression of the . cc-by 4.0 international license it is

in the absence of widespread and systematic testing for covid-19, they provide a useful measure of epidemic progression and the effect of interventions.to get a complete picture of the burden of the burden of deaths due to covid-19, it will be necessary to evaluate spikes in all-cause mortality, as we have done for new york and new jersey here. however, it is difficult to do such analyses reliably in real time with provisional death statistics because the data are incomplete for recent weeks, and the delays in reporting can only be determined retrospectively. our analyses here suggest that excess p&i deaths represent a fraction of all of the deaths related to covid-19 (25-50% based on preliminary data), so the p&i excess mortality estimates we present here represent a lower bound of the burden.there is often a lag in the reporting of death statistics. nchs reports data from 2 weeks prior, but these provisional data are typically still incomplete. in our main analysis, we addressed this by adjusting deaths due to p&i with all-cause deaths, with the assumption that reporting delays for p&i are similar to reporting delays for other causes of death. when calculating excess deaths, we attempted to adjust for reporting delays by using the nchs estimate of data completeness as a multiplier. however, this estimate of data completeness is itself based on numbers of deaths during previous years and might not be reliable during the pandemic period. if anything, we would expect that longer reporting lags would tend to underestimate the excess mortality burden of covid-19 in real-time analyses.it is estimated that the covid-19 epidemic in europe predates that in the us by a few weeks. several european countries have experienced a high death toll, particularly italy and in conclusion, monitoring syndromic causes of death can provide crucial additional information on the severity and progression of the covid-19 pandemic. estimates of excess deaths due to p&i and all-causes will be less biased by variations in viral testing, but reporting lags have to be properly accounted for. together with information on official tallies of covid-. cc-by 4.0

each week in excess of a seasonal baseline to capture the direct and indirect mortality burden of covid-19.we compare these estimates of excess deaths to the reported numbers of deaths due to covid-19 in different states and evaluate the trajectories of these increases in relation to the volume of testing and to indicators of covid-19 morbidity. these analyses provide insights into the burden of covid-19 in the early months of the outbreak in the united states and serve as a surveillance platform that can be updated as new data accrue.data on deaths due to pneumonia and influenza (p&i, icd-10 codes j09-j18) and all-causes by state and week were obtained from the national center for health statistics' (nchs) mortality surveillance system. 9 here we analyze spikes in p&i mortality rather than straight pneumonia to be more comprehensive, as influenza-coded deaths do not necessarily require laboratory confirmation of influenza infection, there is overlap of symptoms between influenza and covid-19, and p&i mortality has been used in us to monitor the severity of influenza and other respiratory pathogens since the 1918 pandemic. in addition, analysis of spikes in all-cause mortality provides a full picture of the direct and indirect burden of covid-19.the nchs mortality data are available with a 2-week lag and are partially complete for the most recent weeks. the p&i mortality data provide the provisional number of deaths due to pneumonia or influenza (ie, deaths with a code of pneumonia or influenza anywhere in the death certificate) and should be adjusted by the total number of deaths reported in real time each week.connecticut, north carolina, and west virginia were missing mortality data for recent months and were therefore excluded from the analyses.the p&i grouping will include individuals who had a listed cause of death as covid-19 (along with a p&i code) as well as people who did not have covid-19 listed as a cause of death. it does not capture people who had covid-19 listed as a cause of death but did not have p&i recorded among the causes.. cc-by 4.0 international license it is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv

intensity of the pandemic in different locations. influenza-like illness (ili) is a longstanding indicator of morbidity from acute respiratory pathogens, including sars-cov-2. weekly state-level ili data were obtained from the cdc's ilinet system 10 , which aggregates data from a network of outpatient providers. to adjust for activity of non sars-cov-2 respiratory pathogens, we used state-level data on laboratory-confirmed influenza activity from the cdc's national respiratory and enteric virus surveillance system (nrevss) 11 . this dataset captures the number of tests performed for influenza and the number that were positive by week and state. the ili data provide the percent of visits to participating outpatient providers that were for ili. ilinet and nrevss data are available with a 1-week lag.the ili, nrevss, and mortality datasets were accessed through the cdc's fluview portal using the cdcfluview package in r. data from nchs, ilinet and nrevss were obtained for the weeks ending january 5, 2013 through march 28, 2020.to compare our burden estimates with official covid-19 tallies, we compiled weekly reports of laboratory-confirmed deaths due to covid-19 in each state from several sources, including the covid tracking project, 12 and nchs 13 . state-specific testing information was obtained was the covid tracking project 12 .the 9 largest states by population, and washington state, were analyzed individually. the remaining states for which we had data were grouped into the corresponding health regions defined by the us department of health and human services ("hhs regions"). we fit poisson regression models to the weekly state-level counts of reported deaths due to p&i from january 5, 2015 to february 8, 2020 (see supplement for details). the baseline was then projected forward until march 28, 2020. we adjusted for seasonality using harmonic variables and included yearto-year baseline variation. influenza activity was controlled for by adjusting for the percent of tests that were positive for influenza in the previous week. the 1-week lag between the testing data and the mortality data accounts for the delay influenza testing and death. the number of allcause deaths was used as a denominator. poisson 95% prediction intervals were estimated by sampling from the uncertainty distributions for the estimated model parameters. 14 .

score (between 0 and 1) based on the number of death reports that have been received from a state and the number expected from that state based on previous years. the excess deaths were divided by the completeness score for each week to get an estimate for excess cases, adjusted for reporting delays.to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates of excess mortality to the adjustment for influenza activity, we refit the regression excluding the influenza covariate. we also fit a model with the same structure to all-cause mortality (without a denominator). to get a measurement of outpatient visits related to covid-19, the same model was fit to data on influenza-like illness.the analyses were run using r v 3.6.1. all analysis scripts and archives of the data are available from

these provisional data are typically still incomplete. in our main analysis, we addressed this by adjusting deaths due to p&i with all-cause deaths, with the assumption that reporting delays for p&i are similar to reporting delays for other causes of death. when calculating excess deaths, we attempted to adjust for reporting delays by using the nchs estimate of data completeness as a multiplier. however, this estimate of data completeness is itself based on numbers of deaths during previous years and might not be reliable during the pandemic period. if anything, we would expect that longer reporting lags would tend to underestimate the excess mortality burden of covid-19 in real-time analyses.it is estimated that the covid-19 epidemic in europe predates that in the us by a few weeks. several european countries have experienced a high death toll, particularly italy and in conclusion, monitoring syndromic causes of death can provide crucial additional information on the severity and progression of the covid-19 pandemic. estimates of excess deaths due to p&i and all-causes will be less biased by variations in viral testing, but reporting lags have to be properly accounted for.

research theme 6:in china has recently passed, the virus transmission is becoming more severe around the world, showing the characteristics of a pandemic. europe has become the new center of the epidemic now. as of march 28, 2020, covid-19 has spread to 199 countries around the world, with a cumulative 462 684 confirmed diagnoses worldwide. among them, the number of confirmed infections in america, italy, spain, germany, france, iran have already exceeded 20 000 [3] . china' s strict prevention and control has earned time for mitigation of the covid-19. the experience and lessons accumulated in china during the exploration of the novel coronavirus deserve to be summed up, which may be useful for other countries to address the challenge. therefore, the purpose of this study is to sort out china' s countermeasures and experience and collect some chinese experts' advice for fighting to covid-19. it is expected to serve as a warning for the global covid-19 prevention and control, and to provide a reference for the formulation of prevention and control strategies in other countries and regions.a questionnaire on how to prevent and control covid-19 was distributed to relevant experts, and their advice was collected for high frequency word analysis and content analysis. railway stations, coach stations and passenger terminals [4] . on january 22, hubei province launched a secondary public health emergency alert. wuhan closed the city on january 23 [5] , and from january 23 to january 29, 31 provinces in china successively initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies [6] . many regions practiced closed-off management then. from march 4, 21 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities nationwide lowered their emergency response levels [7] .closed zone management: closed management was implemented in urban communities or rural villages. non-community or non-village residents or vehicles were not allowed to enter the communities or villages; even the local residents needed to have their temperature measured when they were allowed in and out of the area. in the community or village areas, the epidemic prevention and control groups were established. these could be divided into many subgroups with different functions, such as: propaganda group, environment group, key personnel prevention and control group, personal in and out control group, material support group others, in order to complete the epidemic prevention and control work in an all-encompassing manner [8] .personal management: from february 16, citizens in wuhan were required to scan and enter identifying information when they assessed any open public places [9] . on march 5, 2020, "the reference architecture and technical guide of epidemic prevention access code" was issued. according to this regulation, chinese citizens had to report their health status online and had their general health status captured by two-dimensional codes. the code could also work as an electronic voucher for citizens to go in and out of the local places. the health assessment based on two-dimensional codes was universal in the whole city, even the whole country [10] .staff support: on january 23, shanghai and guangdong sent the first medical teams to wuhan [11] . on january 28, 6097 people across 52 medical teams nationwide went to support hubei [12] . as of march 8, a total of 346 medical teams and 42 600 medical staff arrived in hubei, fighting the virus alongside with local medical staff [13] .funding support: on january 26, national development and reform commission urgently issued 300 million yuan (rmb) to support hubei from the central budget, and 11.21 billion yuan was issued from national finances at all levels in subsidies for disease prevention and control [14] . as of march 4, 110.48 billion yuan had been arranged from the government' s finances at all levels for prevention and control [15] .facility construction: wuhan was the city with the worst epidemic situation, and it has become the key area for the epidemic prevention and control. in order to fight covid-19, wuhan set up "vulcan mountain" and "thor mountain" hospitals, which only took about 10 days to finish, to treat severe patients [16] . in addition, 11 cabin hospitals were built for mild patients, and a dozen of hotels and schools were recruited to isolate mild patients and close contacts [17] . the policy for the patients, as well as the close contacts, was changed from self-isolation at home at the beginning to all-isolation at hospital or hotel at the end.recognition of novel coronavirus: the understanding of novel coronavirus was a gradually developing process. on december 8, 2019, wuhan municipal health commission notified the first confirmed case that showed symptoms on that same day. on january 2, 2020, the whole genome sequence of novel coronavirus was obtained by the wuhan institute of virology, chinese academy of sciences [18] . at a press conference of the national health commission of the people' s republic of china on january 20, professor zhong nanshan confirmed that the novel coronavirus was transmitted from person to person [19] .detection reagents and treatment plan: in terms of detection reagents, on january 4, china' s centre for disease control developed a specific pcr detection reagent. on january 11, china' s centre for disease control provided pcr detection reagents to wuhan hospitals. on january 26, the national medical products administration approved 4 novel coronavirus detection products from 4 chinese companies [20] . regarding the diagnosis and treatment plan, on january 15, the national health commission of china issued the first trail edition of diagnosis and treatment plan for covid-19. by february 19, the versions were constantly updated. the seventh versions of the diagnosis and treatment plan had been issued [21] . the diagnostic criteria changed from the diagnosis based on the results of the novel coronavirus pcr test to the diagnosis based on clinical ct results. viewpoints research theme 6:drug research and development: on january 28, the research and development of novel coronavirus mrna vaccine was officially initiated [22] . on february 5, the clinical trials of remdesivir began [23] . on february 21, the ministry of science and technology stated that the vaccine should be submitted for clinical trials as soon as late april [24] . on march 6, chloroquine phosphate became a clinical treatment medication [25] . in addition, some chinese traditional medicines have been demonstrated to be effective [26] .facing the severe situation brought by covid-19, china' s government has adopted a series of strict prevention and control countermeasures, which have effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic in china and have gained time for the prevention and control of covid-19 for the other countries. according to the daily outbreak data released by the national health commission of china, from the national point of view, the mortality rate of patients has been declining, and the proportion of patients with severe illness has been decreasing. the trend of cumulative cases in china is shown in figure 1 and the trend of new cases in china is shown in figure 2 . figure 2 shows the changes in relevant national data since the outbreak of covid-19. the numbers of newly diagnosed patients, suspected patients, as well as newly added deaths have risen for a period of time and are currently in a declining phase. current data demonstrates that china' s countermeasures are effectively slowing down the spread of covid-19. it may give a piece of evidence or experience for global covid-19 prevention and control in the near future.as of march 29, china has accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses, 3506 existing confirmed diagnoses, 3306 deaths, and 75 600 cured patients [27] . based on the current data, china' s cure rate is 91.73% and the mortality rate is 4.01%. it is worth noting that there were 693 cases that were imported from overseas. table 1 shows the wuhan, hubei, national and global cumulative number and mortality rate. the data demonstrates that the mortality rate could obviously drop down with sufficient medical resource, for example: the mortality rate in the rest of china, excluding hubei, is much lower that other places. it is quite clear that the overall case-fatality rate is based on the denominator that includes those who were positively tested and not all those infected with symptoms. considering the case-fatality rate of covid-19 in china (4.01%) and the globe (4.66%), some people may consider this disease to be only affecting those with underlying diseases and mainly old persons. however, based on china' s experience in treating those with pneumonia, this would not be entirely true. ten facts of china' s novel coronavirus pneumonia are listed here. these ten facts are well worth global vigilance.according to investigations, more than 3000 medical staffs in wuhan have been infected since the outbreak [28] . it is a warning to the world that the infection rate of the novel coronavirus is very high. more attention must be paid to the infection of medical staff and nosocomial infection.when china adopted the "home quarantine" policy at beginning, there was a large number of household cluster infections, and even tragedies where there would be deaths of entire families [29] . this proved again the high infection rate of the novel coronavirus and that "home quarantine" policy may be not a good choice. once infected by covid-19, patients are better isolated and separated from their families.although it is generally believed that the elderly and patients with underlying diseases have higher mortality rates [30] , it has been proven that healthy young people also can develop severe illness. the severity of the disease may be related to cytokine storm [31] . in addition, there were still a few cases of infant or children infection.the results of molecular diagnosis may be both false negative and false positiveat beginning, the clinical diagnosis was based on detecting method of molecular biology -pcr (polymerase chain reaction). when throat swabs or nose swabs were taken as sampling,there were some patients whose test results showed negative. one of the patients was false negative 5 times [32] . meanwhile there were also "asymptomatic carriers" with positive molecular diagnosis results, but no symptoms [33] .because of false positive and false-negative results, molecular diagnosis, being the unique diagnostic criteria, is challenged. later, combining pcr with clinical ct results was recommended as the basis for the diagnosis of covid-19.the patient's condition might suddenly rapid worsen even during the recovery periodduring treatment, there were some clinical cases in which convalescent patients had significantly improved symptoms. however, the patiens' condition would suddenly deteriorate and they would pass away within only a few hours. the mechanism of death cause remains unknown.on the one hand, covid-19 outbreaks can cause serious medical supplies shortage. on the other hand, the public' s panic can make it much worse. the shortage of medical materials, staff and supplies should all be expected. this phenomenon deserves attention in other regions of the world. the storage of medical materials is particularly important, especially in the early stage of the outbreak.due to the large amount of medical resources invested in the treatment of the novel coronavirus disease, other clinic treatments, such as surgery, emergency medical treatment, tumor radiotherapy and chemotherapy were not available [34] . this lead to increased mortality in patients with other diseases in the hospital.there is no specific and effective treatment for covid-19the clinical treatment for covid-19 is mainly oxygen inhalation and symptomatic treatment. there is no specific and effective drugs for saving life of severe patients at present [35] .viewpoints research theme 6:multi participation and unified action are the guarantee of epidemic controlsince covid-19 first occurred in wuhan, both the central government and the local government in china had paid great attention to it. besides, more than 40 000 medical staff from other provinces were sent to wuhan. other participants from transportation, traffic and military industries actively took part in preparing medical material and food supplies. it took a national-level unified action to effectively control the covid-19.isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of covid-19strict closure of cities and quarantine measures have demonstrated that chinese isolation counter-measures have achieved good results. the achievement is that wuhan will be released from closure in april 8. isolation measures can effectively reduce the covid-19 incidence rate and save many people' s lives. therefore, the isolation counter-measure is worth being recommended to other countries' policy makers.twelve chinese public health professionals or disease control center experts were investigated about how to prevent and control covid-19 recently. their advice was analyzed by high frequency word analysis and content analysis.keywords are used to generalize the literature' s content. keyword frequency may reflect the main content of a group of the documents. table 2 shows the top 30 keywords with their frequency and weight value. integrating them with the high frequency terms, we found that experts' advice for preventing and controlling covid-19 included these specific keywords: material, prevention and control, pathogeny, propaganda, education, hygiene, technology, medical care, overall planning, policy and panic. these keywords reflect some main concerns that chinese experts had about covid-19. content analysis was used to summarize experts' advice for preventing and controlling covid-19. the main advices were sorted and analyzed from four aspects: publicity and education, various subjects, medical materials and law construction. chinese experts' advice is listed in table 3 .the epidemic prevention of covid-19 is not only a battle fought by wuhan, but also a battle of china and eventually the world. based on analyzing the experience and lessons of china' s epidemic prevention and control work, and consulting the opinions and suggestions of some chinese experts, we propose the following advice for the global covid-19 prevention and control: viewpoints research theme 6: covid-19 pandemicfirst of all, in addition to making full use of the two important communication tools, television and the internet, various forms of publicity should be used to make the public fully aware of the severity of covid-19. the public should be well informed of the novel coronavirus. in this special times, it is emphasized to not attend large gatherings, wash hands frequently, cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, wear a mask if necessary and strengthen awareness of prevention. second, it is important to report the epidemic information in a timely and accurate manner. this can effectively avoid panic and mistakes due to misinformation.to cut off the route of transmission using isolation covid-19 is highly infectious. except for patients with obvious symptoms, mild or atypical patients and even asymptomatic infections are all possible sources of transmission. therefore, controlling the source of infection and cutting off transmission routes are fundamental measures for prevention and control of the epidemic. the wuhan closure, work stoppage, school suspension and community closed management, as well as the first-level response to major public health events launched nationwide, are measures that effectively controlled the movement of people and the spread of the epidemic. isolation as an effective approach is worth promoting around the world. on the other hand, home isolation may lead to household cluster infection, which is noteworthy. therefore, if possible, as to all covid-19 patients, they should be treated in covid-19 designated hospitals with a centralized treatment plan to reduce nosocomial infection. as to all susceptible persons or close contacts, they should be asked to stay in hotels, idle factories, large sports grounds or standby isolation places for centralized isolation. all infected patients and close contacts can be found by self-conscious online reporting. currently, isolation may be the unique effective way to cut off the route of transmission and decrease the incidence of covid-19. in addition, in order to prevent the spread of infection caused by secondary pollution, more attention should be paid to a reasonable disposal of covid-19 medical waste. to carry out various forms of publicity, including internet publicity, tv programs, newspapers, books, comics, lectures, etc., so that people can fully understand the new crown pneumonia and how to effectively protect them to reducing social panic by unified voice of authoritative mediafor ordinary people: to strictly control the flow of personnel for covid-19 patients: to be admitted to hospitals for asymptomatic and close contacts: to be isolated from home isolation mode to centralized isolation mode for non-covid-19 other patients: to guarantee normal basic treatment decreasing secondary disasters for front-line medical staffs: to be trained before they are on duty, and be provided sufficient protection materials, salary and remuneration for the grass-roots staffs: to open the community prevention and control mechanism and strengthen the basic protective measures for scientific research: to strengthen international cooperation and scientific research, and strive for new progress in drug research, vaccine development and epidemiological investigation.to meet the medical material needs of the hospitals for prevention and treatment of covid-19to meet the ordinary people' s needs of prevention and control materials and basic daily necessities to guarantee the production, circulation and reserve of all medical materials for covid-19to severely punish those persons who disturb the stability of the market, such as driving up prices and hoarding to severely punish these persons who make rumor and fraud that cause public panic to severely punish the behavior of disobeying the management and escaping from the isolation area without permission to respect and protect the personal information, rights and interests of the covid-19 affected population, and avoid privacy disclosure to avoid covid-19 inducing district stigmatization and discrimination to fully take advantage of information and communications technology (ict) in disease control, diagnosis and treatment to establish a long-term mechanism for infectious disease monitoring and public opinion surveillance to establishing a long-term mechanism for training public health global health and emergency professionals.viewpoints research theme 6:to protect the susceptible groups, especially the high-risk groups according to a survey from hubei, 40% of covid-19 infections are in hospitals and 60% in communities. this is a warning for global epidemic prevention. the susceptible groups of covid-19 include front-line medical staff, elderly population, and the gregarious groups (including nursing homes, residential schools, barracks, prisons, etc.). therefore, the protection provided for them must be given priority in the global work of prevention and control.to take advantage of internet technology and reasonably allocate medical resourcesin the response to the outbreak, combination of online and offline medical consulting in china have been effective to solve the problem of shortage of clinical doctors. in the global work of prevention and control, relevant countries and regions should allocate medical staff reasonably, triage patients properly before or during admission, improve the efficiency of treatment and prevent cross-infection. adequate medical supplies and orderly distribution are important to effective epidemic prevention and control. sufficient human and material support are helpful to ensure the success of treatment of non-covid-19 patients.no country around the world can deal with global epidemic on its own. health is a global issue, and global health is local. thus, the fight against covid-19 relies on local efforts in every country around the world. it is important for all countries to timely share the indicators and information with the who. the global cooperation should include three aspects. first, the world should join hands together to share information of the epidemic situation openly and transparently. second, scientists in the world should cooperate to study the origin of the virus, formulate diagnostic criteria, search for specific clinical drugs, develop vaccines and jointly fight against covid-19. third, all countries should have unified action under the leading of who. under the global unified action plan, the duration for fighting the covid-19 will be shorter.in the era of globalization, all nations share weal and woe. in the face of the covid-19 epidemic, no country can stand alone and only maintain its own safety. people from all over the world should put aside their differences in ideology, religious belief, politics, economy and culture. all countries should work together to fight against the virus instead of shifting blame and suspecting each other, it must be condemned for any government or individual to take advantage of the new pneumonia to stigmatize some other countries. mankind is a community of destiny. only by closer cooperation and mutual help with all countries, can we successfully overcome the pandemic in the global war against covid-19.injury may be secondary to ischemic or nonischemic processes [9, 10] . traditionally, elevated troponin concentrations have been considered equivalent to myocardial infarction. however, with improvements in troponin assays, elevated levels without overt symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia are now more common; hence, the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction considers myocardial injury to be a separate, unique entity [11] . based on current evidence, a myocardial injury without overt ischemia represents approximately 60% of cases of abnormal troponin elevation [9] . the differential diagnosis is broad in such cases. it can be recognized in the variety of cardiac such as acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, cardiac surgery or procedures, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, stress-induced cardiomyopathy, or several non-cardiac conditions such as acute renal failure, sepsis, anemia, hypoxia, critical illness, drug-induced, rhabdomyolysis among others [9, 10] . association of viral infections with myocardial injury has been well recognized, and the most common associations involve adenoviruses and enteroviruses such as coxsackie viruses [12] . according to data from previous influenza virus and coronavirus epidemics, these viral infections have also been shown to cause myocardial injury, because cases of myocarditis have been described to be caused by both influenza and coronaviruses [13, 14] .although sars-cov-2 infection predominantly causes pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia and ards, the disease has also been associated with a variety of cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, arrhythmia, heart failure, and venous thromboembolism [6] . moreover, studies have shown that patients with covid-19 and preexisting cardiovascular disease (cvd) have an increased risk of acquiring the illness and subsequently having severe disease and death [6, 7] . in a clinical bulletin issued by the american college of cardiology (acc), the overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, but the mortality reached 10.5% in patients with underlying cvd [15] . among various cardiac complications, acute cardiac injury with elevated cardiac biomarkers has been described in early studies from china on hospitalized patients with covid-19. we discuss the prevalence, mechanism, clinical characteristics, management, and prognostic implications of sars-cov-2-induced myocardial injury, according to current published research.sars-cov and mers may also result in cardiovascular complications, although most of the data are anecdotal, in the absence of systematic studies. although sars-cov infection is associated with some cardiovascular manifestations, there are no clear reported cases of myocarditis [16] [17] [18] [19] . however, in the 2012 saudi arabia outbreak, mers-cov was reported to cause acute myocarditis and heart failure ( table 1 ) [14] .first author and cohort size

[19] (n=75) acute myocardial infarction cause of death in two of five fatal cases mers alhogbani [14] (n=1) acute myocarditis and acute onset heart failure recovered acute cardiac injury has been reported to be highly prevalent in hospitalized patients with covid-19 ( the earliest single-center retrospective study conducted in china, involving 41 hospitalized patients with covid-19, detected acute cardiac injury in five (12%) patients. in the study, a diagnosis of acute cardiac injury was made if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (troponin i) were above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were detected in electrocardiography (ecg) and echocardiography [1] . since then, numerous retrospective studies reported an increased prevalence of myocardial injury in hospitalized patients with covid-19, with a frequency between 5% and 28% [1, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . the prevalence of cardiac injury increased with the severity of the disease ( however, data regarding troponin elevation in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, non-hospitalized patients are not available.the mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with covid-19 remains uncertain. the following potential mechanisms have been suggested.one potential mechanism is direct myocardial involvement mediated via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) [8, 32] . the betacoronaviruses can infect human hosts through ace2, a membrane-bound protein expressed in many human cells, including vascular endothelia, renal tissue, cardiovascular tissue, and small intestinal epithelia. ace2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin system by inactivating angiotensin ii, and it is likely to protect against acute lung failure. a murine model has demonstrated that pulmonary infection with sars-cov also precipitates ace2-dependent myocardial infarction. among humans, during the toronto sars outbreak, sars-cov viral rna was detected in 35% of autopsied hearts, thus raising the possibility of direct damage of cardiomyocytes by the virus [32] . phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that sars-cov-2 has a very similar receptor binding domain/motif to that of the sars coronavirus, thus suggesting that sars-cov-2 may use ace2 as a receptor to enter human cells and causes direct damage to the lung epithelia, thereby leading to pneumonia and ards. because ace2 is also highly expressed in the heart, covid-19 induced cardiac injury might potentially be mediated by ace2, although whether sars-cov-2 binding alters ace2 expression or causes dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) pathway remains unclear [6, 7, 32, 33] . hence, one potential explanation for the higher likelihood of acquiring infection, and the increased risk of severe disease and adverse outcomes in patients with covid-19 with pre-existing cvd, maybe the elevated secretion of ace2 in these patients, thus making them more susceptible to direct viral damage to cardiac myocytes [33] ; but, this has not yet been demonstrated in pathology studies. in a case report describing autopsy results for a 50-year-old man who died of covid-19 associated with ards, histologic examination of biopsied cardiac tissue showed rare interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates without substantial myocardial damage. however, the troponin level was not reported in the study [34] .another suggested mechanism of covid-19 related cardiac involvement is an overwhelming immuneinflammatory response and cytokine storm [6, 7, 33] . the hallmark of cytokine storm syndrome is an uncontrolled and dysfunctional immune response involving the continuous activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and macrophages [24] . huang et al. have found that patients with covid-19 admitted to the intensive care unit have higher plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukins (il-2, il-7, il-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and igg-induced protein 10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor α [1] . from a previous study of sars-cov infection and cardiovascular complications, subclinical diastolic left ventricular impairment appears to be common during acute sars infection and to be reversible after recovery, thus suggesting that left ventricular dysfunction in the acute phase might be associated with cytokine storm syndrome [18] . several studies have shown that patients with covid-19 with myocardial injury show evidence of severe systemic inflammation, including elevated leukocyte and neutrophil counts, interleukin levels, c-reactive protein, procalcitonin, globulin, and biomarkers of myocardial injury and stress, such as creatine kinase and myoglobin and n-terminal pro-b-type natriuretic peptide (nt-probnp), thus linking myocardial injury to the severity of inflammation and subsequent ventricular dysfunction [24, 25, 35] . similarly, in a case report of sars-cov 2 induced fulminant myocarditis, the described patient had markedly elevated interleukin 6, thus suggesting that the presence of cytokine storms might have caused increased vascular wall permeability and myocardial edema, thus resulting in the observed thickening of the interventricular septum. because the myocarditis was transient, and recovery was enhanced with the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt), myocardial injury can be considered to be associated with an excessive immune response mediated by viral infection [36] .severe hypoxia due to acute lung injury and several systemic complications caused by the virus can result in oxidative stress and hence secondary myocardial injury due to increased myocardial oxygen demand [7, 33] . for example in one study, there was a characteristic pattern of rise in cardiac troponin i over time. the troponin level was normal during admission, but subsequently increased in 37.5% of patients especially in those who died. in those patients, the troponin level significantly increased in the week preceding the death coinciding with severe systemic disorders including multiple organ failure, severe electrolyte disturbances, management of ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo), severe metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction all of which can potentially lead to secondary myocardial injury due to increased oxidative stress on the heart [37] .studies have demonstrated that patients with underlying cvd and other comorbid conditions are predisposed to myocardial injury during covid-19; the prevalence of hypertension among patients with cardiac injury has been reported to be as high as 45%-65%, and that of coronary artery disease (cad) has been reported to be approximately 20%-30% ( thus making the plaques prone to rupture. inflammation also causes endothelial dysfunction and increases the procoagulant activity of the blood, thereby contributing to the formation of occlusive thrombi over ruptured coronary plaques and predisposing patients to ischemic myocardial injury [38] .there are several clinically diagnosed myocarditis cases in patients with covid-19 with supporting imaging ( in the study, among 84 patients with covid 19, four (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed with sars-cov-2 myocarditis based on the most updated diagnostic criteria for viral myocarditis [42] . however, in a singlecenter retrospective study in 112 admitted patients with confirmed covid-19, the authors explored whether sars-cov-2 caused the myocarditis by performing at least one echocardiographic evaluation in all patients during hospitalization. a total of 14 patients (12.5%) presented with abnormalities suggestive of possible myocarditis with an elevation of troponin. the myocarditis diagnosis was based on findings of triple elevation in cardiac troponin i (>0.12 ng/ml) plus abnormalities in echocardiography and/or ecg. the abnormalities in echocardiography were defined as a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) (<50%) or segmental wall motion abnormality or left ventricular wall thickening (>10 mm) and/or presence of pericardial effusion (≥5 mm); the abnormalities in ecg were defined as st-segment elevation/st-t changes. the echocardiography did not show typical signs of myocarditis, as stated above, except for the presence of small pericardial effusion in some patients and nonspecific ecg manifestations, most commonly tachycardia, which was not typical for myocardial injury but was more suggestive of systemic causes. hence, the authors suggested that myocardial injury may be more likely to be a result of systemic consequences rather than direct damage by sars-cov-2 [37] .uncertainties exist whether sars-cov-2 can directly cause cardiomyocyte infection as no biopsy-or autopsy-demonstrated sars-cov-2 localization within cardiomyocytes has been reported to date. in a study of covid-19 through post-mortem needle core biopsy of the lung, liver, and heart in four patients who died of covid-19 pneumonia, cardiac biopsy performed in two patients in whom cardiac troponin was elevated during hospital course showed only mild focal fibrosis and mild myocardial hypertrophy, which were probably associated with the underlying conditions, such as hypertension-associated myocardial hypertrophy and past ischemic injury; however, there was no evidence of inflammatory cellular infiltration to indicate myocarditis [43] .tavazzi et al. have described the first case in which a biopsy demonstrated myocardial localization of viral particles suggestive of sars-cov-2, in a patient presenting with cardiogenic shock [41] . the clinical presentation was suggestive of fulminant myocarditis; however, the pathologic study demonstrated lowgrade myocardial inflammation without evidence of myocardial necrosis. given that the viral particles were observed in interstitial cytopathic macrophages and their surroundings, but not in cardiac myocytes, the authors could not infer viral cardiotropism and suggested that either a viremic phase or migration of infected macrophages from the lung is likely to occur in patients with covid-19 with non-ischemic acute myocardial injury [41] . further investigations along with the histological demonstration of myocarditis (inflammatory lymphomonocytic infiltrates plus myocyte necrosis not typical of ischemia [44] ) and identification of the viral genome in cardiac tissue will be required in the future to clarify the direct association of covid-19 with myocarditis.myocardial injury has been shown to present in three different patterns:1. the most common pattern is mild troponin elevation (typically < 99th percentile of the upper reference limit), with a modest rise or fall on subsequent days, as frequently observed in patients without cardiac symptoms and those who survive after hospitalization [21, 37] .2. the second pattern is progressive, in which some patients have normal troponin levels or moderate troponin elevation during admission. however, the level progressively increases as the patients experience clinical deterioration with respiratory failure along with an increase in other biomarkers (e.g., interleukin-6, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase) and usually occurs during the second week of hospitalization. this pattern is observed among non-survivors, and death occurs around a median of 18.5 days after symptom onset. one study has demonstrated that at four days after symptom onset, the median high sensitivity cardiac tni (hs-ctni) levels were 8.8 pg/ml in non-survivors vs. 2.5 pg/ml in survivors. during follow-up, the median hs-ctni among survivors did not change significantly (2.5-4.4 pg/ml), whereas it rose to 24.7 pg/ml on day 7, to 55.7 pg/ml on day 13, to 134.5 pg/ml on day 19 and to 290.6 pg/ml on day 22 in nonsurvivors [21, 32, 37] .3. the third pattern is early moderate troponin elevation (which may approach or exceed the 99th percentile upper reference limit) and, subsequently, fall over the course of illness; this pattern is usually seen in patients with clinically suspected myocarditis presenting predominantly with cardiac symptoms [36, 39, 40] .studies have shown that patients with cardiac injury are more likely to be older (median age 65-74 years) than those without cardiac injury [22, 24, 25] , and most patients present with typical symptoms of covid-19 like fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. in a study of 291 covid-19 patients, 15 of whom had evidence of cardiac injury, no patients complained of chest pain or palpitations. the common symptoms at illness onset in both groups of patients with or without cardiac injury were similar and included fever, cough, headache, fatigue, and dyspnea [22] . however, a minority of patients with cardiac injury might present with cardiac symptoms with or without respiratory symptoms. in another study, 11 of 82 (13.4%) patients with myocardial injury presented with chest pain, compared with 3 of 334 (0.9%) patients without cardiac injury (p<0.001) [24] . in a case report of myocarditis, the initial presenting symptom was chest pain and respiratory involvement, but an atypical presentation without respiratory symptoms was also described [36, 37] . in terms of radiologic findings, bilateral and multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity are more prevalent in patients with than without cardiac injury [25] . limited studies in which patients with cardiac injury underwent ecg have revealed ecg abnormalities such as t-wave depression and inversion, st-segment depression, and q waves [24] . patients with clinically suspected myocarditis have been found to have stsegment elevations [39, 40] .patients with cardiac injury and elevated troponin are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to develop complications including ards, malignant arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, acute coagulopathy, electrolyte disturbances, and acute kidney injury, and to receive mechanical ventilation, crrt, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and vasopressor therapy, thus further suggesting that cardiac injury might be associated with the clinical outcomes of covid-19. the use of antibiotic treatment, glucocorticoids, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is also significantly higher in patients with cardiac injury than without cardiac injury [24, 25] .studies have shown that cardiac injury is associated with higher mortality in patients with covid 19 ( tables  2,3 [24] . similarly, in another case series, even though patients with covid-19 with cardiac injury and underlying cvd had the highest mortality (69.44%), patients with underlying cvd but normal tnt levels during the disease course had more favorable prognoses than patients with elevated tnt levels but no underlying cvd (mortality, 13.3% vs. 37.5%), thus indicating relatively favorable prognosis in patients with underlying cvd but without myocardial injury [25] . these studies demonstrate that cardiac injury might be independently associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients with covid-19.moreover, the mortality rate directly increases with the magnitude of the reference value of cardiac troponin. in a single-center, retrospective cohort study including 188 patients with covid-19 in wuhan, china, conducted to explore whether heart injury occurred during covid-19 on admission and later increased mortality, approximately 11.2% of patients had high-sensitivity cardiac troponin i (hs-tni) exceeding the clinical upper normal limit on admission. patients with high levels of hs-tni on admission had significantly higher mortality (50.0%) than patients with moderate or low levels of hs-tni (10.0% or 9.1%). besides, hs-tni level on admission was significantly negatively correlated with the number of survival days (r=-0.42, p=0.005) [35] . a study by guo et al. showed that tnt and nt-probnp levels increased significantly during hospitalization in patients who ultimately died, whereas these dynamic changes in tnt or nt-probnp levels were not evident in survivors [25] . based on a few studies, initial measurement of cardiac biomarkers immediately after hospitalization for sars-cov-2 infection and longitudinal monitoring during the hospital stay may aid in identifying a subset of patients who might progress to a poorer clinical condition. however, further evidence from more studies is required.a myocardial injury should be suspected in patients with covid-19 with troponin elevation or new abnormalities in ecg and could be related to type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction, myocarditis, stressinduced cardiomyopathy or cytokine induced-myocardial injury [45, 46] . the approach to evaluating myocardial injury in patients with known or suspected covid-19 should be based on balancing the benefits of further evaluation in changing the management strategy versus the potential risk of nosocomial spread of covid-19 infection [45, 46] .as such, elevated troponin levels should not be considered as evidence of acute myocardial infarction, which is diagnosed based on symptoms and signs of ischemia and ecg changes [9] . in a multicenter case series study form six hospitals in new york inpatients with confirmed covid-19 who had st-segment elevation on ecg with the elevation of cardiac enzymes, 10 out of 18 patients were classified as having noncoronary myocardial injury with no evidence of obstructive disease on coronary angiography and normal wall motion on echocardiography. eight patients received a clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction. the median peak troponin level was higher in patients with myocardial infarction than in those with a clinical diagnosis of noncoronary myocardial injury [47] .if the clinical presentation is suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (acs), timely evaluation is required to determine the need for urgent intervention. in patients with covid-19 who have mild to moderate troponin elevation without symptoms and signs of acute heart failure, clinical monitoring may be performed without routine cardiac imaging until the recovery from the acute viral syndrome [46] . for patients with clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure, echocardiography may be performed if the management strategy and prognosis would be likely to change with the diagnosis. the possible diagnosis in the patients with ventricular wall motion abnormalities, elevated troponin, and no acs include clinically suspected myocarditis or stress cardiomyopathy [45] . as there is no established therapy for clinically suspected myocarditis, routine evaluation with cardiovascular magnetic resonance or endomyocardial biopsy in those cases is not recommended [45] . as such, regardless of fulminant or non-fulminant presentation, american college of cardiology recommends against routine endomyocardial biopsy in patients with active covid-19 with abnormal cardiac enzymes as biopsy is unlikely to change immediate clinical management whether the etiology is due to myocarditis, cytokine-induced myocardial injury or type-2 myocardial infarction [45, 46] .unfortunately, beyond guidelines for treating patients with ischemic myocardial injury, no consensus exists regarding the routine management of patients with covid-19 and myocardial injury. the management of myocardial injury focuses on identifying and treating the underlying cause and supportive care (including management of heart failure, therapy of arrhythmias, and avoidance of cardiotoxins) [45, 46] . if the patient clinically deteriorates or develop hemodynamic instability, or has severely elevated or rapidly rising troponin, detailed evaluation, cardiology consultation and enrollment in clinical trials or experimental therapies like antiviral agents, anti-cytokines (il-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab), the convalescent plasma may be considered on the case-by-case basis [46] . although the use of steroids has not been recommended in the general treatment of covid-19, some reports have described patients recovering from fulminant myocarditis with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. however, more studies will be needed to determine which patient would benefit from such therapies [8] . for patients with refractory shock or ventricular arrhythmias secondary to fulminant myocarditis, early institution of mechanical support with ecmo can be considered as case reports with the successful rescue of such patients have been described [46] . in general, as the presence of cvd and myocardial injury in covid-19 patients has been associated with more severe outcomes and increased mortality, triaging patients with covid-19 according to the presence of underlying cvd and evidence of myocardial injury for prioritized treatment strategies may be reasonable [25] .finally, several therapies with potential cardiovascular side effects are currently being studied, and caution must be used when administering these therapies to patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. for example, preliminary clinical research has suggested the potential efficacy of hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin for treatment of covid-19, but this is associated with qtc prolongation and risk of fatal arrhythmias, thus warranting regular monitoring of qtc [48] . controversy remains concerning the use of acei/arb for covid-19. some preclinical studies have suggested that raas inhibitors may increase ace2 (functional receptor for sars-cov-2) expression, raising concerns regarding safety in patients with covid-19; however, the data remain anecdotal, and no clinical studies have evaluated the effects of raas inhibitors in covid-19. as such, several leading professional societies recommend continuation of raas inhibitors for patients who are at risk for, being evaluated for or currently have covid-19, and are taking these medications to treat other conditions for which these agents are known to be beneficial, such as heart failure, or ischemic heart disease [49] .most studies have been conducted on chinese cohorts, and thus the generalizability of the results to other countries, including the united states, remains to be determined. most studies have been single-centered retrospective studies with the enrollment of small numbers of patients. larger cohorts, multicenter and prospective studies should be planned. they should include assessment of detailed heart function related data, particularly ecg, echocardiography and possibly cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to determine myocardial function, and the etiology and mechanism of cardiac injury. most studies have not discussed why troponin was measured in the first place, and no data are available to support a different management strategy for patients with elevated troponin. studies must be planned to define whether adjunctive cardioprotective therapies, such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antivirals agents, interferons and/or immunomodulatory therapy (immunoglobulins), may be advisable for patients with significant elevation of cardiac injury biomarkers. pathological examination of myocardial tissue of patients with covid-19 with definite myocardial injury will be needed to provide pathological evidence of the etiology of myocardial injury and establish covid-19 as a new etiological agent for myocarditis.in conclusion, covid-19 has been associated with an increased prevalence of acute cardiac injury, even more so in patients with severe disease. the presence of preexisting cardiovascular disease increases the risk of cardiac injury in patients with covid-19. although the exact mechanism underlying the association of cardiac injury in patients with covid-19 remains unclear, direct virus-induced cardiomyocyte injury leading to viral myocarditis, systemic cytokine-mediated myocardial injury and hypoxia-induced myocardial oxidative stress have been suggested. the presence of myocardial injury is independently associated with mortality and may be a predictor of progression to severe disease and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19. further studies are needed to elucidate the predominant etiology of myocardial injury in patients with covid-19 and to promote targeted treatment programs to improve patient prognosis.in compliance with the icmje uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: payment/services info:

epidemic diarrhoea virus (pedv). it causes acute and watery diarrhoea in pigs of all ages although the most severe signs are reported in piglets less than two weeks old, in which diarrhoea leads to severe dehydration and is associated with mortalities which can reach up to 100 % in affected litters.the first clinical description of ped occurred in the uk and belgium in the early seventies. however, it was not until 1978 when the etiological agent of these diarrhoeal outbreaks, a new coronavirus, was identified [1, 2] . soon afterwards, studies by the research group led by professor pensaert in ghent, belgium, demonstrated that there were no specific antibodies against pedv in sera collected from sows prior to 1971, confirming that pedv was a new virus in the european swine population. up to now, there is no information available on the potential origin of this virus.distribution after its first description in uk and belgium, pedv spread throughout european countries causing diarrhoeal outbreaks in a relevant number of pig herds [3] [4] [5] . pedv or specific antibodies against pedv were reported in several european countries (belgium, the uk, the netherlands, germany, hungary, bulgaria, france, switzerland and spain) in the seventies and the eighties [3] [4] [5] . mortality in piglets less than two weeks old varied from 0 to 100 %, but it was usually lower than that described in outbreaks of diarrhoea caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev) which is another porcine coronavirus classically recognized as a cause of diarrhoea disease in swine. however, for unknown reasons, ped outbreaks markedly decreased in the nineties and in subsequent years in europe. isolated outbreaks associated with low mortality in piglets were reported in some countries, i.e. spain [6] , hungary [7] , the uk [8] or the czech republic [9, 10] . the only well-documented ped epidemic over the last 10 years in europe occurred during the winter of 2005-2006 in northern italy. on average, pre-weaning mortality raised from 8.3 to 11.9 %, peaking at 34.5 % in one particular farm [11] . recent ped outbreaks have been reported in germany [12] [13] [14] , italy [15, 16] , the netherlands [17] , belgium [18] , france [19] , the ukraine [20] and other european countries (unpublished data).in contrast to the situation in europe, pedv has remained as a major cause of diarrhoea outbreaks on swine farms in asia for over 30 years. viral-like diarrhoea outbreaks were reported on pig farms in shanghai, china in 1973 and despite the fact that tgev and other known enteropathogenic agents were ruled out, the aetiology could not be determined. pedv was firstly demonstrated in the area in 1983 in china [21] and japan [22] . in the nineties the virus spread to neighbouring countries such as korea [23] , the philippines and thailand [24] . later on, it was reported in taiwan in 2007 [25] and vietnam in 2009 [26] . due to its relevance in this area, attenuated or killed vaccines, which confer partial protection against pedv, have been used in several asian countries. these vaccines have been used in china since 1995 and also introduced in japan in 1997, south korea in 2004 and the philippines in 2011 [27] . it is relevant to point out that in october 2010, a large-scale and severe ped outbreak was reported in several provinces in southern china and spread to other provinces within this country as well as to other neighbouring countries [28, 29] . the outbreak caused high mortality among suckling piglets, between 50 and 90 % and given the fact that china was clearly not a naïve country regarding pedv infection, it was proposed that probably a new variant of pedv with a higher virulence was circulating.recently, in april 2013, pedv was identified for the first time in the usa, on pig farms located in ohio [30] . the virus spread quickly within the country and 1 year after the first description, the number of ped affected farms exceeded 5000 spreading to over 25 states. in addition, the virus spread to other countries in north, central and south america and ped outbreaks were reported for the first time on pig farms in mexico (july 2013), peru (october 2013), the dominican republic (november 2013), canada (january 2014), colombia (march 2014) and ecuador (july 2014) [31] .based on genomic analysis, the coronaviridae family has been recently divided into four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus [32] . pedv is a member of the genus alphacoronavirus together with other coronaviruses which infect pigs (tgev and its respiratory variant, porcine respiratory coronavirus or prcv), dogs (canine coronavirus), cats (feline infectious peritonitis virus), humans (human coronavirus 229e or human coronavirus nl-63) or bats. there are also other swine coronaviruses (table 1) . porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (phev) is a betacoronavirus which causes an infection associated with chronic emaciation and death in young pigs (vomiting and wasting disease) while porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov), a member of the genus deltacoronavirus, has recently been identified as the etiological agent of an enteric disease similar to ped or tge [33] .coronaviruses are enveloped viruses which possess a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome. they are morphologically characterized by the presence of projections or peplomers on their surface. like other members of the alphacoronavirus genus, pedv possesses four structural proteins: three membrane proteins identified as s protein or spike protein, m protein or membrane protein and e protein (previously sm or small membrane protein) and a nucleocapsid protein or n protein which encapsidates viral rna. s protein is particularly relevant among the structural proteins. it is a glycoprotein which induces neutralizing antibodies and interacts with cell receptor in the host. there are also three nonstructural proteins: two of them are encoded in open reading frames (orf) 1a and 1b and are involved in genome replication and transcription while the third, encoded in orf3, has been reported to be an ionchannel protein [3] [4] [5] .antigenic relationships in pedv and other coronavirus have been researched into [34] . although some crossreactivity between pedv and tgev associated with one epitope on the n-terminal region of n protein was recently reported, pig tgev antisera do not neutralized pedv and vice versa. no cross-reactivity has been reported between pedv and any other coronavirus of the beta, gamma or delta genera.direct and indirect pedv transmission occurs mainly by faecal-oral route. viral shedding in faeces starts on postinfection day one or two and continues for a period of 7 to 10 days [35, 36] , although it can extend up to 36 weeks in some animals [37, 38] . the transmission of the infection is facilitated by the high viral load in faeces from infected animals [39, 40] as well as by the minimum infectious dose required to infect naïve pigs [31] . moreover, the resistance of the virus in the environment facilitates the faecal-oral transmission. pedv is stable under low temperatures, while it is adversely affected by high temperatures. it survives between ph 5.0-9.0 at 4°c while only between ph 6.5-7.5 at 37°c. it can survive for at least 28 days in slurry at 4°c, 7 days in contaminated dry feed at 25°c or 14 days in contaminated wet feed at 25°c [31] . this fact favours the indirect transmission by different faeces-contaminated fomites such as transport vehicles [41] , feed [42] , clothing or footwear.genetic and phylogenetic analyses of american pedv isolates revealed a close relationship with chinese isolates and their likely chinese origin [43] . however, how the virus might have travelled from china to the usa is a matter of speculation.the rapid spread of pedv on swine farms in the usa raised questions regarding the possibility of airborne transmission of this infection. although undoubtedly the faecal-oral route is the main source of pedv transmission, it has been suggested [44] that pedv may travel through the air for short distances on faecal dust particles, at least under certain conditions. however, airborne transmission of pedv has only been shown under experimental conditions and up to now infectious pedv has not been demonstrated in field air samples containing pedv genetic material [44, 45] . the role that vectors play in the transmission of pedv has also been investigated. so far, there has been no evidence of pedv replication in non-porcine hosts, including rodents and starlings [46] [47] [48] . however, the potential role of vectors in the mechanic transmission of the virus from one farm to another cannot be ruled out, as has been described for tgev [4] .using highly sensitive molecular assays the presence of viral rna has been reported in milk samples from infected lactating sows [28, 29] as well as in semen samples [29, 31] . however, infectious pedv in these samples has not been demonstrated and their contamination with faecal material in the sampling cannot be excluded. moreover, viral rna has been detected in the serum fraction of whole blood samples from infected pigs [40, 49] .the role of spray-dried porcine plasma (sdpp), normally used as feed additive, as a potential vehicle of transmission of pedv has been researched into. a number of experimental studies have demonstrated that spray-drying process as well as storage conditions are sufficient to inactivate infectious pedv in sdpp [50, 51] . the infectivity of commercial sdpp positive for pedv-rna has also been investigated. a research group from canada managed to reproduce pedv infection in sdpp-inoculated piglets, although they failed to reproduce the infection in animals receiving feed supplemented with the same pedv-positive sdpp [52] . similarly, neither clinical signs nor pedv rna in faeces or pedv specific antibodies were detected in pigs which were fed a diet containing 5 % sdpp confirmed positive for pedv, in a bioassay experiment conducted by opriessnig et al. [53] . according to this, there is no experimental evidence of pedv transmission through pcr positive sdpp supplemented feed. this experimental data is corroborated by the fact that despite the use of large amounts of pedv positive sdpp from the usa to feed pigs in brazil or western canada, these areas remained free of pedv infection [54] .pedv replicates in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes of the small intestine and causes villous shortening and reduced enzymatic and absorptive capacity in the small intestine causing profuse watery diarrhoea, which lasts about a week [37, 55, 56] . other clinical signs which are frequently associated to pedv infection include vomiting, anorexia and fever. although pigs of all ages are affected, the severity of ped is higher in suckling piglets of less than one week old which may die due to severe dehydration. the slower turnover of enterocytes in neonatal piglets (5-7 days) compared to three weeks-old piglets (2-3 days) could explain, at least partially, the higher susceptibility of these young piglets to pedv [4] .pedv has also been detected in epithelial cells of the colon in both experimentally and naturally infected pigs, although villous atrophy has not been demonstrated in the large intestine [40] .replication of pedv was classically circumscribed to the intestinal tract [3] , until a recent research showed pedv replication in alveolar macrophages of 3 day-old-colostrum-free piglets, which were experimentally inoculated with a korean wild-type pedv isolate [57] . further studies are needed to confirm whether extra-intestinal replication also occurs with other pedv isolates as well as to determine their clinical and epidemiological relevance.two epidemiologic presentations of ped have been described on the farms. (a) epidemic ped outbreaks occur when pedv is introduced into a naïve farm (where most of the animals are pedv seronegative). the disease spreads rapidly affecting pigs of all ages with morbidity approaching 100 %. moreover, pedv can persist and become (b) endemic on the farm affecting post-weaning piglets that have lost their lactogenic immunity as well as newly introduced seronegative gilts.mortality associated with ped outbreaks is highly dependent on the age of the infected animals. mortality can reach up to 80-100 % in suckling piglets of less than one week old, while in weaned pigs mortality rates are typically only 1 to 3 % [11, 30] . no mortality associated with ped is usually observed among adult pigs.as has already been mentioned, differences in the severity of ped outbreaks have been reported. particularly severe ped outbreaks have been described in asia since 2010 and also in the usa. differences in the virulence of pedv isolates have been proposed to explain this variability [28, 58, 59] . from our point of view, this is one of the most relevant questions to face regarding ped nowadays: the reason or reasons which could explain variations in the clinical outcome of an outbreak. although some reports have suggested that they could be associated with differences in the virulence of pedv isolates, exhaustive challenge studies using pig adapted virus (not cell culture adapted isolates) in suckling piglets are needed to elucidate the role of the strain. some insights have been obtained related to the virulence of different strains. in the usa, at least two main variants of pedv have been recently identified using molecular methods. the first one seems to be a highly virulent virus and similar to viruses described in several asian countries after 2010 while the second, the s indel variant, has been associated to mild clinical outbreaks [59] . this s indel variant includes some particular insertions and deletions in the s gene and is also similar to some asian isolates, part of which were recovered before 2010. the classical european reference strain of pedv cv777 is also an s indel isolate although it is located in a different cluster and well differentiated from american indel isolates ( fig. 1a and b) . pedv isolates recovered in european countries (germany, italy, belgium, the netherlands and france) in 2014 and 2015 have been characterized and all of them were found to be indel isolates similar to the variant described in the usa [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . most of these recent ped outbreaks in europe occurred in fattening farms and, as expected, no mortality was observed. however, pedv isolates recently recovered in severe outbreaks of pedv in ukraine have shown a genome nucleotide similarity reaching 99.8 % with non-indel isolates from the united states and mexico [20] . so far, this has been the only report of pedv non-indel isolates in europe. apart from differences in the virulence of the pedv strains, many other parameters including management, immune status of the population and herd sanitary status could also explain variations in the clinical outcome of ped outbreaks [31] . thus, the contribution of co-infections with other viruses, particularly with other enteric viruses such as porcine delta coronavirus (pdcov) or the recently described mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (mrv3) has also been pointed out. both viruses have been detected in faecal samples collected from pedv positive farms in the usa. pdcov has been associated with mild to moderate diarrhoea in experimentally inoculated naïve suckling piglets [33] while mrv3 caused severe diarrhoea with 100 % mortality in 3-day-old piglets [60] .although the rapid spread of a disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhoea affecting pigs of all ages allows the clinician to suspect that a viral agent is involved in the infection, differential diagnosis to identify pedv at the laboratory would be needed.direct detection of pedv in faecal samples by conventional or real-time pcr, are the most frequent assays used at present [27] . pcr-assays are generally based on the amplification of fragments within the m, n or s protein genes and are associated with a high sensitivity and specificity. there are also some elisas, which are usually based on the use of monoclonal antibodies against pedv. although their analytical sensitivity is generally lower than pcr assays [61] , they are useful under field conditions as the amount of virus in faecal samples from diseased animals in epidemic outbreaks of ped is very high.immunohistochemistry (ihc) is also a very useful tool based on the detection of pedv antigens within infected cells in formalin-fixed sections of small intestine. it is less sensitive than molecular diagnostic methods but, in contrast, it allows for the evaluation of tissue lesions [62] . in order to increase the sensitivity of ihc assays, several sections of the small intestine of affected pigs sacrificed in the acute phase of the infection should be investigated.indirect methods are focused on the detection of antibodies. the detection of pedv specific antibodies is very useful, not for the investigation of diarrhoea outbreaks, but to determine whether an animal or a herd has previously been infected by this virus. taking this approach into account, serology is a good tool for surveillance as it provides useful information regarding viral spread in a region or a country. however, the number of tests for the detection of pedv specific antibodies is limited to elisas, indirect immunofluorescence assays (ifa), immunoperoxidase monolayer assays (ipma) and seroneutralization. most of these tests are in-house assays and information regarding their sensitivity and specificity is usually scarce. in general, the elisa tests have proven to be capable of detecting pedv specific antibodies a little earlier and for longer periods of time than ifa tests [35] .there is no specific treatment for pedv other than supportive care and symptomatic treatment. mortality occurs in suckling piglets as a result of dehydration which should be corrected using oral electrolyte solutions. in adult pigs, dry feed should be withdrawn for a period of 12-24 h and then, carefully reintroduced while water should be kept freely available [3, 4] . in order to increase passive immunity to piglets and minimize losses, sows due to farrow in at least 2 weeks can be deliberately exposed to virulent virus by the oral route. a recent study revealed that morbidity was reduced from 100 to 43 % in litters exposed to virulent pedv when their sows were previously exposed to a mild virulent strain (s indel variant) of pedv [63] . oral administration of chicken egg-yolk or cow colostrum containing pedv immunoglobulins could offer an immunoprophilactic defence [64, 65] . the increase in lactogenic immunity is also the aim of pedv vaccines which are used in pregnant sows. attenuated or killed vaccines against pedv have been used in several asian countries for years [66] . however, it has been suggested that live vaccines can revert to virulence and their use and usefulness under field conditions have been questioned [5, 27, 67] . recently, a pedv subunit vaccine based on the s protein gene of pedv as well as a vaccine with killed virus have been licensed in the usa [68] , although there are still no studies which prove their efficacy. however, pedv vaccines have never been used in europe as the disease was not of sufficient economic importance in this area. in general, pedv vaccines have been reported to be useful to booster antibody response in animals that have already been infected by pedv.as there are no specific treatments for the control and potential eradication of the disease from the herd, preventive measures which preclude the introduction of the virus or new pedv strains in the area, country or farm are of paramount importance. supported by the detection methods mentioned in the diagnosis, surveillance should be used to certify that trading of swine or related derivatives do not cause the spread of new strains of the virus. lorries used in transport have been highlighted as a relevant source of transmission [41] and special attention should be paid in the effectiveness of the cleaning and disinfecting protocols to inactivate and remove the virus. at herd level, basic external biosecurity rules such as quarantine of reposition, ban the entrance of unwashed vehicles, strict visitor policies (time interval between visiting two farms, provide footwear and appropriate clothing, showers and so on) should be carried out without exception and internal biosecurity such as controlling the slurry level, carcasses disposal and carcass bin cleaning, movement of the caretakers on the farm and so on could prevent the establishment of an endemic form of the disease. finally, many virucidal disinfectants have been shown to be effective in inactivating pedv. phenol, quaternary ammonium compounds, glutaraldehyde and bleach are examples of such disinfectants. water temperature is a crucial factor and temperatures over 60°c help to inactivate the virus. proper cleaning and disinfecting of facilities and equipment is crucial to control pedv.the emergence and spread of pedv on us pig farms has aroused growing interest in this coronavirus. the main areas of recent research on this disease have been focused on the molecular characterization of the isolates as well as the sources of infection and means of transmission. despite the fact that relevant knowledge has increased, there are still a number of questions to be answered. on one hand, any difference in virulence among the pedv variants described needs to be clarified. on the other hand, the rapid spread of this virus in the usa has raised concerns about its transmission mechanisms. pedv is mainly spreads by the faecal-oral route either by direct or indirect contact (feed or fomites such as vehicles). other routes or sources for its transmission such as air-transmission, vectors or sdpp have been investigated although their implication has not been clearly demonstrated.the recent ped outbreak in the american continent also shows that more research is needed for the control of the disease, based on the development of useful vaccines and surveillance of the virus, standardising its detection in laboratories with the final goal being the limiting of its spread. the authors declare that they have no competing interests.all the

was identified in patients clustered around the huanan seafood market in wuhan, china. 1,2 next generation sequencing was used to identify a novel coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from three of these patients. infection with sars-cov-2 leads to the syndrome of coronavirus disease 2019 . rapid international spread of this potentially lethal virus has caused global concern, with 110,000 cases and 3,800 deaths reported to date. 2, 3 here, we will summarize the latest insights into the biology of sars-cov-2 and their implications for anesthesiologists in perioperative and intensive care settings.relative to the assortment of viruses that cause human upper respiratory tract infection, the group of viruses that cause lower respiratory tract infection is smaller, but includes influenza and parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, cytomegalovirus, and hantavirus. these infections are mostly limited to tracheobronchitis in healthy individuals but can cause severe viral pneumonias in immunocompromised patients. while influenza is one of the best-known causes of pneumonia in the intensive care unit (icu), this presentation is frequently related to bacterial superinfection, such as with staphylococcus aureus. 4 some of the rarity of viral pneumonia can be attributed to the types of cells that viruses can infect, termed tropism. thus, while the more common influenza strains (like h1n1) target cells in the trachea and bronchi, influenza pneumonia is particularly linked to avian strains (like h5n1) that skip the upper respiratory epithelium and infect alveolar epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract. 5 sars-cov-2 is a beta-coronavirus, a family that includes the original severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) virus, as well as middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (mers), and endemic human pathogens that are common causes of the cold, including oc43 and hku1. while beta-coronaviruses have been around for more than 5,000 yr, outbreaks of lethal strains of sars-cov in 2002 and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in 2012 have added to their notoriety. 6 sars-cov, middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and sars-cov-2 all likely originated in bats, with sars-cov using civets as intermediary hosts and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus passing though camels. pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are implicated in the passage of sars-cov-2 to humans on the basis of sequence similarity with pangolin coronaviruses. 7 the variable clinical manifestations caused by distinct coronavirus strains can be attributed to structural differences in virus proteins, affecting tropism and replication. the "corona" description references the crown-like halo of viral spike (s) proteins observed by electron microscopy ( fig. 1 ). variations in this s-protein determine which proteins coronavirions use to enter cells. early investigations into sars-cov-2 suggest that it uses tissue angiotensin converting enzyme-2 as its receptor, a trait shared with sars, but not middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus or more common endemic human coronaviruses such as oc43 and hku1. 8, 9 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 special section: is expressed in the lower respiratory tract but not bronchi, as well as enterocytes in the small intestine. 10 thus, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 dependence may explain the clinical presentations of lower respiratory tract infection and enteritis in covid-19. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression in vascular endothelium and cardiac myocytes has also been implicated in acute cardiac injury resulting from covid-19. 11 in animal models, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers increase angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression and activity, respectively, leading to speculation that these medications could possibly potentiate sars-cov-2 infection. 12 major cardiology societies do not recommend changing renin angiotensin aldosterone system antagonist treatments based on covid-19 risk at this time. 13 other sites express angiotensin converting enzyme-2, such as the tongue and parts of the genitourinary tract, but the clinical significance of this finding in covid-19 is unclear. 14 binding of s-protein to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 likely contributes directly to pathogenesis, resulting in downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2, increased production of angiotensin ii, and resulting increased pulmonary vascular permeability. 15 while sars-cov-2-susceptible angiotensin converting enzyme-2 appears universally expressed in humans, there may be genetic variations regulating angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression that could lead to differential susceptibilities across populations and genotypes. 16 after viral binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2, the virus may be endocytosed or directly fuse with the cell membrane ( fig. 2) . a positive-sense viral rna transcript is then translated by the host cell, yielding two polypeptides. these polypeptides are subsequently divided by viral proteases, yielding the viral replication machinery. coronaviruses employ multiple mechanisms to shield viral rna from host detection and subsequent induction of antiviral interferon responses, including direct antagonism of interferon signaling proteins and replication of viral rna in double membrane vesicles. 15 nonetheless, covid-19 strongly induces cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-7, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, interferon-ɣ, tumor necrosis factor-ɑ, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1-ɑ, suggesting a broad type 1 and type 2 helper t-cell response. 17 it remains uncertain to what extent direct viral cytotoxicity versus the host cytokine storm and other immune responses contributes to morbidity in covid-19.after initial coronavirus infection, immune responses appear effective in controlling viral infection, suggesting that vaccines should be feasible. there were important caveats from animal vaccine models: antibody responses waned quickly, indicating that immune responses might not be long-lasting. 18 also, in one mouse coronavirus model of sars, natural killer cell, antibody, and interferon responses were beneficial, but t-cell responses paradoxically worsened outcomes. 19 accordingly, vaccines will need to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before widespread adoption.the incubation period for sars-cov-2 appears to be from 4 to 7 days. initial reports demonstrated rapid person-to-person viral transmission, with the number of infected individuals doubling every 7.4 days. 20 viral evolution patterns inferred from viral gene sequence variations suggest that much of the viral transmission that has occurred in the united states has been undiagnosed, where two cases reported 6 weeks apart could potentially represent a cluster of hundreds of infections. 21 two distinct groups of sars-cov-2 sequences have been identified: the l-type represented 96% of the cases in wuhan, while the more ancestral s-type was found in 38% of cases outside wuhan. it has been postulated that the s-type could be less severe and thus capable of more rapid spread because of less negative selective pressure. 7 the majority of patients with covid-19 infection present with fever as the first symptom. other common symptoms at onset of illness include cough or fatigue. less commonly reported symptoms include palpitations, headache, and diarrhea. a subset of patients develop dyspnea at days 5 to 8 after hospitalization. the most commonly reported hematologic laboratory abnormalities with covid-19 are leukopenia and lymphopenia. 17, [22] [23] [24] the cause of this leukopenia is not well understood but could relate to bone marrow suppression, lymphocyte sequestration, or apoptosis. 25 the clinical spectrum of covid-19 cases has ranged from asymptomatic to critically ill. 23 while the majority of patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis, up to 15% of patients will develop pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), cardiac injury, renal injury, or multiorgan failure from days 7 to 10 after hospitalization. a subset of patients with covid-19 will require admission to the icu and respiratory support with noninvasive or invasive ventilation, or potentially extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 17, [22] [23] [24] a summary of covid-19 symptoms, complications, and treatment in the initial wave of case series publications is presented in table 1.of concern to anesthesiologists in the perioperative setting, some patients present with minimal respiratory symptoms. in one of the initial case series, a patient with abdominal symptoms was admitted to a surgical service and infected at least 10 healthcare providers. 24 abdominal symptoms of covid-19 may reflect angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression in the small intestine and are potentially underappreciated, since patients with gastrointestinal symptoms may not be tested for sars-cov-2. indeed, sars-cov-2 may be transmitted via the fecal-oral route via contaminated surfaces. 26 pneumonia or abnormalities in chest computed tomography images were detected in almost all hospitalized patients with covid-19. the characteristic radiographic findings are ground glass opacities, which are typically bilateral and peripheral, coexisting with consolidations or cordlike opacities. 17, 27, 28 as covid-19 progresses, "reverse halo" or "crazy-paving" radiologic patterns may become apparent. notably, some radiologic features are rare with covid-19, such as lymphadenopathy, nodules, pleural effusions, or cavitation, and would potentially suggest other pathologies. 28 for diagnosis of sars-cov-2, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing is the standard assay. throat swab and nasal swab samples are commonly used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. while reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is a useful test to confirm the diagnosis of covid-19, with limitations of sample collection and kit performance, the total positive rate of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for throat swab samples has been reported to be about 30 to 60% at initial presentation. 29 serial reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing and inclusion of lower airway sampling can improve the sensitivity of testing. commercially 15 endocytosis is a potential target of chloroquine, which prevents endosomal acidification that triggers viral membrane fusion. chloroquine may also modify ace2 terminal glycosylation and inhibit coronavirus binding. viral rna is then transcribed to generate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab that are cleaved by a protease to generate the viral replication machinery. these polyproteins are cleaved to form replication-transcription protein complexes (rtcs) by a viral protease 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3clpro). 3clpro has been postulated to be a target of human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors lopinavir or ritonavir, although in silico studies have questioned this theory. 108 viral rna is replicated and transcribed in double membraned vesicles (dmv) in replication-transcription protein complexes, which include the rna-dependent rna polymerase that is the putative target of remdesivir. viral mrna is then translated and virions are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi.available molecular tests for endemic coronaviruses, such as the filmarray respiratory panel (biofire diagnostics, usa) do not detect sars-cov-2 currently. it is expected that sars-cov-2 will be added soon. 30 chest computed tomography may have higher sensitivity for covid-19 infection, with a sensitivity as high as 97% in one study. 29 based on challenges with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing, computed tomography imaging has been proposed as a primary tool for covid-19 detection in hospitalized patients in epidemic areas. however, within the first 2 days after symptom onset, the majority of patients may have normal computed tomography imaging. 28 thus, early in the disease course, there may be no diagnostic sufficiently sensitive to exclude covid-19.pathology findings of covid-19 have been reported in some cases. 31, 32 while many of the pathologic findings are similar to those seen with coronavirus-associated severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by sars-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, such as inflammatory infiltrates and hyaline membrane formation, the findings of inspissated spherical secretions or fibromyxoid exudates are more prominent in covid-19 infection. accumulation of these thick secretions likely causes decreased alveolar gas exchange predisposing to respiratory failure, suggesting a potential role for airway clearance and bronchial hygiene in the treatment of covid-19.the full ramifications of sars-cov-2 infection are yet to be understood. early work points to a wide variety of psychiatric complications affecting patients, their families and providers, and larger communities relating to anxiety, isolation, frustration, stigma, and guilt. 33 this disease also poses increased risk to specific subpopulations, such as transplant candidates and recipients, 34 and patients with cancer. 35 as highlighted in published case series, there is wide variation in clinical presentations of covid-19, ranging from no symptoms to intractable ards and shock. the determinants of these varied outcomes remain unknown, but experience with other viruses suggests that variation in the dose of viral inoculum, route of inoculation, and underlying immune status of the patient can lead to widely variable host responses. 36 higher viral loads on random sampling identified individuals with greater symptom burden in influenza 37 and greater mortality in adenoviral pneumonia. 38 at the same time, moderate sars-cov-2 viral loads can be detected in nasal swabs up to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and in asymptomatic individuals. 39 the attributable risk from higher viral inocula is difficult to quantify in real-world settings, but higher viral loads in critically ill patients pose at least a theoretical risk to healthcare providers. 40 the major risk factors for mortality among early reported cases of covid-19 are old age and underlying n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 25% 0% 0% 12% 104 retrospective 62 hospitalized zhejiang province, china 77% 50% 52% 98% 2% n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 2% n/a n/a 0% 0% 105 retrospective 18

not applicable or not reported. respiratory disease. 24 again, the reasons for these age associations are unknown, but there are multiple theories that can be extrapolated from host-pathogen biology. for example, immunosenescence could contribute to the increased risk among the aged. as individuals age, the frequency of naive b and t cells diminishes, implying less capacity to recognize and adapt to novel antigens. at the same time, aged immune cells have less proliferative and functional capacity even when responding to known antigens. such age-related changes in cellular immunity manifest in decreased vaccine effectiveness, worse outcomes in the setting of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and herpes zoster infections, 41 and have been demonstrated in mouse models of coronavirus infection. 18 as the lung ages, the airway epithelium restorative capacity is also diminished. telomere dysfunction is one biologic mechanism of aging, which primarily manifests as pulmonary fibrosis but can also restrict leukocyte proliferation. it is conceivable that poor outcomes from covid-19 could be linked to short telomeres, as has been reported with pulmonary fibrosis, ards, and sepsis. 42, 43 it is also possible that younger individuals may have differential susceptibility to sars-cov-2. interestingly, in the rat lung, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 expression decreases with age. 44 children also could benefit from immunity developed from other coronavirus infections. indeed, modest cross-reactivity was observed between endemic coronaviruses, such as oc43 and sars-cov. 45 this potentially protective cross-reactive immunity would be limited by age and immunosenescence. if fecal-oral transmission resulted in a milder gastroenteritis presentation of sars-cov-2, it is also conceivable that children could be subsequently protected from the covid-19 respiratory syndrome. while we currently can only speculate as to the causes of variation in covid-19 presentations, these mechanisms likely hold important clues that will inform management and therapeutics.while most patients with covid-19 appear to have a relatively mild disease course, a subset will develop hypoxemic respiratory failure with imaging patterns consistent with diffuse viral pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, or diffuse alveolar damage. 28, 46 the true incidence of severe pulmonary disease associated with sars-cov-2 is not yet clear, but several studies from hubei province have reported a 5 to 25% icu admission rate among hospitalized patients with confirmed sars-cov-2, and an ards diagnosis in 60 to 70% of patients admitted to the icu (table 1) . 24, 47 among patients who do develop dyspnea and hypoxemia, the median time from onset of symptoms to the development of dyspnea appears to be between 5 and 8 days, with ards developing in a smaller subset of those patients at 7 to 10 days. 24, 47, 48 the management of severe hypoxemia in covid-19 is drawn from the management of ards and also informed by experience during the 2003 sars-cov and 2012 middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus outbreaks. the world health organization has published a practice guideline on the clinical management of covid-19 severe respiratory infection, 49 and several other groups have also published practice recommendations for the care of patients with covid-19-associated ards. [50] [51] [52] [53] the treatment of patients with covid-19-associated ards is made more complex due to necessary infection control interventions such as the use of isolation rooms and the need for care providers to wear appropriate personal protective equipment. transmission of sars-cov-2 from patients to healthcare workers has been reported, and infection control is of primary importance to protect healthcare workers and prevent further spread of sars-cov-2. 24, 54 the world health organization guideline recommends, in addition to routine standard precautions, that providers use droplet and contact precautions when caring for any patients with confirmed or suspected sars-cov-2 infection, with the addition of airborne precautions when any aerosol-generating procedure, such as intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is performed. 49 additional guidelines and frontline reports from groups in hubei province suggest many providers are utilizing airborne precautions at all times while caring for covid-19 patients as an additional safety measure. 50, 51 in select patients with covid-19-associated respiratory failure presenting with hypoxemia that is not adequately treated with low flow nasal cannula oxygen or conventional facemask, a trial of either noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or heated and humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen may be reasonable before endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. 49 world health organization covid-19 management guidelines, among others, suggest this trial should be of limited duration (1 h) to avoid unrecognized severe respiratory decompensation that requires emergent intervention. the use of high flow nasal cannula or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is contraindicated in patients with hemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or altered mental status. 49, 50 high flow nasal cannula can provide 100% oxygen to patients at a high flow rate, adds a low (2 to 3 cm h 2 0) positive end-expiratory pressure (peep) effect, and reduces the work of breathing in patients with acute respiratory failure. 55, 56 high flow nasal cannula has been used to treat ards with a good safety profile, but given its more recent clinical introduction, there are little data from other outbreaks to guide its use in covid-19 associated respiratory failure. 49, 57 in one study of 310 patients with ards randomized to receive initial high flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, or conventional oxygen therapy, the use of high flow nasal cannula did not significantly reduce intubation rates overall, but patients special section: covid-19 randomized to the high flow nasal cannula arm had a lower 90-day mortality rate. 58 patients with moderate or severe ards were less likely to require conversion to mechanical ventilation when randomized to the high flow nasal cannula arm of this trial. 58 a systematic review of the use of high flow nasal cannula in ards did not find a difference in mortality or intubation rates as compared with usual care, and found that high flow nasal cannula is well tolerated by patients. 57 the use of novel indices, such as the ratio of oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen to respiratory rate, may be helpful to predict clinical deterioration and the need for intubation when high flow nasal cannula is used. 59 given the existing literature base, the use of high flow nasal cannula as an initial strategy for the treatment of covid-19-associated respiratory failure appears reasonable when patients are closely monitored for worsening respiratory distress. world health organization covid-19 guidelines and others recommend avoiding high flow nasal cannula use in patients with severe or worsening hypercapnia, hemodynamic instability, multiorgan failure, or altered mental status. 49, 50 although guidelines recommend the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in the management of acute respiratory failure due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) exacerbation leading to respiratory acidosis, no recommendations have been made regarding the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in ards. 60 the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with ards has been evaluated in several large trials. a recent study reported a high (greater than 40%) rate of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate to severe ards. 61 in this study, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure was associated with increased mortality, as was the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with more severe ards (pao 2 /fio 2 less than 150 mmhg). 61 several authors have suggested that the increased mortality observed when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is used in patients with more severe ards and in those who ultimately require invasive mechanical ventilation may be explained by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation delaying time to a needed intubation, and from lung injury caused by uncontrolled high tidal volumes with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. 58, 60, 62 there are limited data to suggest that when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is delivered via helmet to patients with ards, failure rates and mortality may be lower than when a conventional noninvasive positive pressure ventilation facemask is used. while a helmet mask may be additionally beneficial from an infection control perspective, this intervention is not widely available. 63 experience from the 2009 h1n1 influenza epidemic and the middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus epidemic also informs the recommendations for use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in covid-19. a large observational study of h1n1 patients reported a greater than 50% noninvasive positive pressure ventilation failure rate and increased mortality in those patients who failed initial noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and required invasive mechanical ventilation. 64 an observational study of the treatment of patients with middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus reported a greater than 90% failure rate with the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. 65 based on the best available data, the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation as an initial strategy for the treatment of covid-19-associated ards is likely reasonable in the subset of patients with mild ards, those in whom copd exacerbation or heart failure may also be contributing to respiratory distress, and when the patient is closely monitored for improvement or worsening respiratory distress. 49, 50 there is substantial concern that using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal cannula in patients with viral respiratory illness results in increased production of aerosolized virus particles, creating a risk for healthcare workers or contaminating the clinical environment. while multiple studies from the 2003 sars epidemic have identified participation in tracheal intubation as a risk factor for viral spread to healthcare workers, noninvasive ventilation was only identified as a risk factor in two small studies not considered robust enough to establish the risk of transmission in a 2012 meta-analysis. [66] [67] [68] experimental studies of exhaled air dispersion by mannequins in isolation rooms using conventional low flow nasal cannula, high flow nasal cannula, and continuous positive airway pressure with nasal pillows or full facemask, demonstrated greater exhaled air dispersion with conventional low flow nasal cannula at 5 l/min (up to 1 m from the patient's face) as compared with either high flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure. 69, 70 the authors postulated that lower exhaled air dispersion from high flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure masks could be related to tighter fit to the face with these modalities, and also that the humidified air generated by these modalities could result in exhalation of larger droplets with a shorter trajectory due to gravity. 70 the use of a full noninvasive positive pressure ventilation facemask might also prevent spread of aerosolized droplets in a patient who is sneezing or coughing. 53 thus, there is a risk that any method of oxygen delivery to a patient with covid-19-associated respiratory distress can result in spread of virus-containing exhaled air, especially if the mask is poorly fitted or leaking, but the concern that use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or high flow nasal cannula specifically leads to worse environmental contamination is not substantiated by the current available evidence. patients receiving any supplemental oxygen therapy should be cared for in airborne isolation rooms whenever possible, with staff using full contact, droplet, and airborne isolation precautions. 51, 71 providers should be aware that coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days, and all surfaces and equipment used for sars-2-cov-infected patients should be carefully disinfected with 70% or greater ethanol for small surfaces or 0.1% or greater sodium hypochlorite for larger surfaces. 72 regardless of the choice of initial oxygen therapy for patients with covid-19-associated respiratory failure, these patients should be closely monitored for deterioration and intubated promptly to avoid the need for an emergent intervention. 51, 73 experience from the 2003 sars epidemic suggests that intubation is a time when healthcare workers are at high risk for viral transmission from infected patients (odds ratio, 6.6). 66 it should be noted, however, that several of the healthcare providers who contracted sars while intubating patients were wearing only standard surgical facemasks at the time of intubation, and there is no strong evidence to link intubation with risk of transmission of virus to healthcare workers when proper airborne precautions are taken. 74 of note, while several post hoc reports from the 2003 sars epidemic and emerging reports from this current epidemic recommend the use of higher level personal protective equipment such as a powered air-purifying respirators, double gloves, coveralls, foot covers, or hoods when performing aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, there does not appear to be evidence to support the superiority of these measures over standard droplet, contact, and aerosol precautions. 66, 73, 75 some have even suggested that the use of increasing layers of barrier precautions without strong evidence to support their application makes patient care more challenging and could increase the risk of contamination during lengthy and complex personal protective equipment removal procedures. 74, 75 application of full barrier precautions has been reported to take at least 5 min, and ideally should not be performed emergently. 74 when endotracheal intubation is indicated, the world health organization covid-19 clinical guidelines suggest that it be performed by an experienced provider using airborne precautions. 49 the guidelines also recommend the use of any modality (non-rebreather mask, bag valve mask, high flow nasal cannula, or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation) for preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 5 min, and the use of a rapid sequence induction when possible to avoid coughing or need for positive pressure breaths. 49 additional guidelines and experiential reports from hubei province largely echo these recommendations. 50, 51 of note, data from a recent meta-analysis did not note any benefit from the use of high flow nasal cannula for peri-intubation preoxygenation as compared with usual oxygen therapy in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. 76 however, high flow nasal cannula may be of benefit to prevent severe hypoxemia during intubations with prolonged apneic times or in patients who have very severe hypoxemia. 76 see table 2 for additional clinical recommendations regarding airway management.after intubation, management of covid-19-associated respiratory failure is the same as in ards from other causes. u.s., european union, and recently released united kingdom ards guidelines strongly recommend the use of low tidal volume ventilation (4 to 8 ml/kg predicted body weight in the u.s./european union guidelines or less than 6 ml/kg in the united kingdom guidelines, to maintain plateau pressures less than 30 cm h 2 0), with permissive hypercapnia. 77, 78 the u.s., european union, and united kingdom guidelines also strongly recommend the use of prone positioning for greater than 12 h per day in patients with severe (moderate-severe in united kingdom guidelines) ards, and this recommendation is echoed in the world health organization sars-cov-2 guideline. 77, 78 however, as prone ventilation is a resource-intensive intervention where the endotracheal tube and other lines may become displaced, it is only recommended when there are sufficient human resources and expertise within the medical center for this intervention to be performed safely. 49 the world health organization guidelines for the management of covid-19 echo the united kingdom ards guidelines in recommending a conservative fluid management strategy for patients without evidence of tissue hypoperfusion. 49, 78 while both the u.s./european union and united kingdom ards guidelines weakly recommend the use of higher peep in moderate to severe ards and the united kingdom guidelines weakly recommend the use of neuromuscular blockade by continuous infusion early in moderate to severe ards, recent clinical trials challenge these recommendations, and thus, various components of best clinical practice for ards remain unclear at this time. 79, 80 a large multicenter trial of patients randomized to receive either a conventional low peep ventilation strategy or a titrated peep strategy resulting in high peep combined with lung recruitment maneuvers found increased mortality in the higher peep and lung recruitment maneuver arm. 81 regarding the use of neuromuscular blockade, a recent multicenter randomized trial found no mortality benefit with its use in early moderate to severe ards, and more adverse cardiovascular events in the paralysis arm of the study. 82 with these trials in mind, the world health organization guidelines suggest cautious use of higher peep in moderate or severe ards, but not routine use of neuromuscular blockade. 49 in patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation with best practices, there are limited data to guide effectiveness of the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. the united kingdom ards guidelines weakly recommend consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ards and refractory hypoxemia, although this recommendation was published before the results of a randomized controlled trial of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for ards, which was stopped early due to lack of a statistically significant mortality benefit between the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation special section: covid-19 • strict adherence to universal precautions at all times. 49 • perform practice drills to familiarize providers with appropriate procedures for donning/doffing personal protective equipment during both nonemergent and emergent situations. • perform crisis management simulation to help providers prepare for intubation and code blue events in isolation rooms. intubation• do not delay intubation in patients with worsening respiratory failure, avoid emergent situations where personal protective equipment must be applied in haste. 51,53 • for intubations either in the operating room or icu, wear at least a gown, n95 or higher mask, cap, face shield, and gloves. some sources suggest powered air-purifying respirators, double gloves, boots, and coveralls. 51,52,71 • if using a powered air-purifying respirator, consider an n95 under it to minimize risk of contamination when removing the powered air-purifying respirator. 51 • have a colleague or personal protective equipment champion check proper personal protective equipment application before entering the patient's room or operating room. • consider writing provider names on gowns or hoods (if worn) to make identification easier. 52 • consider the assembly of intubation kits with all needed supplies in advance, to avoid multiple entries/exits to an isolation room, and delays in obtaining necessary supplies. 51,54 • consider reviewing an intubation plan with all providers before entering the patient room.• have the minimal number and most experienced personnel in the room whenever possible. 50, 51, 71, 73 • use disposable equipment whenever possible. 73 • preoxygenate for 5 min with 100% oxygen to avoid manual ventilation if possible. 49 • when possible, use a rapid sequence or modified rapid sequence induction to avoid bag mask ventilation of the patient. 49 • consider inserting a laryngeal mask airway if prolonged need to mask the patient is anticipated. 71 • rocuronium may be preferred to succinylcholine as paralytic in rapid sequence induction to avoid the potential for paralysis to wear off and the patient to cough if the intubation procedure is prolonged. 71 • attach a high efficiency hydrophobic filter between the mask or endotracheal tube and bag. 51, 73 • avoid awake fiberoptic intubation if possible to decrease patient coughing during intubation. 73 • use video laryngoscopy where available to increase the distance between the patient and intubating provider. 51 • put the cuff up immediately after intubation of the trachea. 71 • monitor intubation success with capnography-use of personal protective equipment may make auscultation with a stethoscope difficult or impossible. 51, 52, 71 • consider the use of ultrasound or chest radiograph to confirm tracheal rather than bronchial intubation, as auscultation may be difficult or impossible. 51 • note that standard 0.05% sodium hypochlorite was not as effective at inactivating coronavirus as 0.1% (double concentration) sodium hypochlorite. 72 • clearly label rooms and hot zones with patients with covid-19 so that providers know to put on appropriate personal protective equipment. 73 • have a colleague or personal protective equipment champion check proper personal protective equipment removal after exiting the patient's room. oxygen and ventilator management• use noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, high flow nasal cannula, or mechanical ventilation only in single airborne isolation rooms. 51 • consider having patients on supplementary oxygen via nasal cannula wear a surgical mask over the tubing. 51 • consider the use of in-line suction systems or minimize suctioning if possible. 49 • frequently empty condensation from tubing lines. 53 • consider using medications such as dexmedetomidine, lidocaine, or remifentanil on extubation to minimize coughing. pre/postoperative care units• designate an isolated covid-19 holding/recovery area, ideally a dedicated room with negative pressure ventilation. 51, 52 • consider requiring all patients and providers to wear masks in the perioperative setting. 52 • consider having all patients transported to and from operating rooms wear a surgical mask or n95. 52 • consider dedicated hallways and patient transport routes for covid-19 patients, if possible. 52 operating room• consider a dedicated operating room for patients with covid-19, ideally with an anteroom and both with negative pressure. if no negative pressure operating rooms, work with engineering to turn off the positive-pressure system. 51 • or, consider using a negative pressure isolation icu room as an operating room if surgery is necessary on a patient with covid-19. 106 • use a dedicated anesthesia machine with high efficiency hydrophobic filters on the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the circuit. change the filters every 3 to 4 h during operative cases. 52 • consider general anesthesia for patients to reduce the risk of coughing, or if not intubated have patients wear a surgical mask or n95. • minimize staff and handoffs. • operating room and ventilator must be completely cleaned after use. pay special attention to the patient chart, pens, and phones when disinfecting. code blue • create modular code packs to bring into rooms to prevent contamination of code blue carts and make needed equipment easily accessible in an isolation room during an emergency. 51 • consider implementing a special designation, such as "protected code blue," to distinguish a code blue in a patient with covid-19 from other code events. 51 • designated a "protected code blue coach" who makes sure all care providers entering and exiting the room follow safe don/doff procedures with personal protective equipment. 51 perioperative clinic • in the case of an epidemic, consider screening preoperative patients for fever, and sending those who are ill or febrile to the emergency room or home as appropriate. • consider having providers use contact, droplet, and potentially aerosol transmission precautions when seeing patients in the preoperative clinic.group and the medical management group. 78, 79, 83 however, a re-analysis of the data from this trial, as well as a meta-analysis incorporating these new trial data, suggest that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may provide a mortality benefit in patients with severe ards. 84 in a small case-control series during the middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus outbreak, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for refractory hypoxemia was associated with lower in-hospital mortality. 85 considering these data, it may be reasonable to refer covid-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia despite lung protective ventilation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in centers with the expertise and resources to properly manage such complex patients. 49, 50 if patients with covid-19-associated respiratory failure develop superimposed septic shock, adherence to standard sepsis treatment protocols is advised. 49 additional, nonevidence-based recommendations for the management of covid-19-associated respiratory failure have been promulgated by a variety of guidelines and published sources, largely focusing on minimizing viral spread to healthcare workers or the environment. these recommendations include minimizing ventilator disconnections, the use of in-line catheters for airway suction, 49 using a high efficiency hydrophobic filter between the patient and the breathing circuit, 51, 73 and avoiding the use of nebulized medications in favor of metered dose inhalers if bronchodilators are indicated. 51 a collected list of practical recommendations to guide anesthetic and critical care management of covid-19 patients is found in table 2. table 3 provides a list of organizations offering updated guidelines and resources for providers caring for patients with covid-19.while there are no drugs specifically approved for treatment of covid-19, there are multiple ongoing clinical trials and a number of drugs that show promise. sars-cov-2 is an rna virus, like human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and ebola, and molecules developed for other rna viruses may be useful targets ( fig. 2 ). in particular, remdesivir is a nucleotide analog developed for use with ebola infection. the drug inhibits the rna-dependent rna polymerase used by coronavirions to replicate their genome. 86 based on in vitro evidence of effectiveness, the manufacturer initiated two phase 3 clinical trials of the use of remdesivir in covid-19 (trial nos. nct04292730 and nct04292899). similar trials in severe and moderate cases of covid-19 are underway in china (trial nos. nct04252664 and nct04257656). remdesivir is also the initial treatment arm in an adaptive clinical trial sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (trial no. nct04280705). this adaptive trial will be actively modified to add novel drugs of interest and to replace the control arm with the current best supported regimen. interestingly, the antimalaria drug chloroquine has also been shown to inhibit sars-cov-2 at micromolar concentrations. this agent, which blocks virus infection both at entry and postentry stages, has been used in therapeutic and prophylactic regimens for more than 70 yr, so its safety profile, including prominent neurologic and gastrointestinal side effects, is well known. 87 among its possible mechanisms of action are altering the ph of endosomes and directly modifying angiotensin converting enzyme-2. 88 compared with a historical control cohort, sars-cov-1 patients treated with combination lopinavir/ritonavir had significantly lower risk of ards or death. 89 the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir has been used in covid-19 cases as well, based on these sars data and in vitro effectiveness. 90, 91 however, clinical effectiveness remains unproven, and providers should be cognizant of the known side effect profile for this medication and monitor for hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia, and arrythmias. 92 an ongoing clinical trial is comparing patients randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir and the viral fusion inhibitor arbidol (trial no. nct04252885). as the optimal regimen remains to be determined, affected patients should consider enrolling in clinical trials whenever available.world health organization and centers for disease control and prevention recommendations 49,93 discourage the use of corticosteroids, given the risk for precipitating infectious and noninfectious complications, such as secondary bacterial infections or hyperglycemia. further, in middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus patients, steroid therapy was associated with delayed viral clearance and no improvement in survival. 94 however, it can be difficult to account for the bias that sicker patients are more likely to receive steroids. in ards, despite multiple randomized controlled studies of corticosteroids, the benefits of corticosteroids remain equivocal. 95 it is likely the benefits are greater for select ards patients, such as those early in the disease course or those with superimposed septic shock. 96 covid-19 patients have multiple distinct radiologic patterns: diffuse ground glass, reticulation, consolidation suggestive of pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, and organizing pneumonia. 46 in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, steroid administration has been suggested to prevent progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure in case series. 97 at the same time, the requirement for steroids has been shown to be less relevant for organizing pneumonia with an identified cause, as in covid-19. 97 compared with steroids, patients treated with macrolides for mild cryptogenic organizing pneumonia also demonstrated symptom resolution, albeit with higher relapse rates. 98 in case series of covid-19 patients, steroids and macrolides were commonly used, but we lack data as to their effectiveness. 24, 47 in a retrospective analysis, which could be confounded by indication, steroid therapy was associated with decreased risk of death in patients with ards and covid-19. 99 specific studies in covid-19 patients are needed to determine whether corticosteroids or macrolides could be beneficial in a subset of patients, such as those with organizing pneumonia patterns.in the face of this rapidly emerging global threat, there are several reasons for optimism about future control. as described above, a number of antiviral drugs have shown promise in vitro. even a partially effective antiviral could allow sufficient reduction in viral load so that the immune system can recover and respond to prevent lethal disease. there is even potential that antivirals could be used in chemoprophylaxis to prevent transmission in recently exposed individuals. while resistance to antivirals developed quickly in patients with hiv, studies in coronaviruses suggest this might be less of a problem. 100 similarly, while hiv readily evades cellular and humoral immunity, sharply limiting vaccination approaches, 101 sars-cov infection appeared to induce broad and long-lasting immunity with less evidence of immune escape. 102 thus, it is likely that as covid-19 evolves, physicians will have a variety of therapeutic and vaccination options to minimize morbidity and mortality. until these arrive, anesthesiologists will be called upon to provide supportive care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission to themselves and others. the severity of symptoms variable was categorized as mild, severe, or critical. mild cases included non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases. severe was characterized by dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥ 30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, pao2/fio2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours. critical cases were those that exhibited respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure 8 .medians and interquartile ranges were calculated as summaries of continuous variables.for categorical variables, percentages of patients in each category were determined.poor outcome was defined as the earliest of death. the time to death were investigated using survival analysis with follow up starting at hospital admission and ending on 20 february 2020. the primary end point was death. patients were censored if at the end of the end of follow up they were still alive (for mortality). the kaplan-meier method was used for time-to-death plot. comparisons between groups of time-to-death data were made using the cox proportional hazards model. a multivariate cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze independent risk factors for mortality from the three variables: age, onset of dyspnea, presence of any comorbidities. the same method was used to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes. spss (version 22.0) was used for all statistical analyses. a p value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.the initial study cohort comprised of 209 elder patients. five patients who contracted j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 5 covid-19 while in the hospital during a prolonged stay that began well before the the median time between the onset of symptoms and admission was 10 days (7-14 days). the iqr time from self-reported earliest known exposure to onset of symptoms was 11days (7-15days) for prodrome (fatigue or myalgia), 10 days (7-14 days) for selfreported fever, 11 days (8-14 days) for diarrhea, and 10 days (7-14 days) for cough or dyspnea.laboratory data on admission are shown in table 2 the univariate cox proportional hazards model showed that the mortality risk was 5.3 times of that in those aged above 70 (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.1 to 9.0; p<0.001).for every 5 years increase in age, the risk of death increased by 1.55. however, there was no difference in the proportion of men and women with mortality. the initial state of covid-19 at admission is closely associated with mortality in the elderly. severe or critical cases were associated with an increased mortality risk of 10 (95% ci 5.4 to 14.6; p<0.001).the presence of any comorbidities increased the mortality risk (hazards ratio (hr) 3.1, 95% ci 1.6 to 5.8; p=0.001), with copd (hr 3.1, 95%ci 1.8 to 5.4 ; p< 0.001) and chronic renal failure (hr 4.2, 95% ci 1.7 to 10.5; p=0.002), being the most important comorbidities ( table 2 ). the presence of cardiovascular disease with an increased mortality of 1.8 (95% ci 1.1 to 2.9; p=0.016), similar to hypertension with an increased mortality of 2.3 (95% ci 1.5 to 3.6; p<0.001)(figure 2).other j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f 8 comorbidities factors (cancer and diabetes mellitus) had no significant effects on mortality. in addition, onset of dyspnea before admission increased the mortality risk (hr 2.0, 95% ci 1.3 to 3.2; p=0.002). leucocytosis, neutrophilia, ph values, ckmb levels, , ultra-tni, d-dimer, albumin, procalcitonin, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, the partial pressure of oxygen, and oxygen saturation were also associated with death ( we conducted a cohort of 204 elder patients over 60 years who were hospitalized with covid-19 in wuhan, china. we observed similar clinical features as recently reported covid-19. the most common symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. fever was the first symptom reported by many patients (78.9%). the onset of dyspnea might help physicians identify the patients with poor prognosis.35.3% patients were classified as severe or even critical cases on admission. the overall rate of serious illness was higher than those reported in previous studies. in addition, a significant portion of patients showed bilateral infiltrate chest radiograph results on admission.univariate analysis showed age of 70 years or older, comorbidity (hypertension, j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f cardiovascular disease, copd, chronic renal failure), onset of dyspnea, and several laboratory indices abnormalities were associated with poor outcome. in our multivariable cox proportional hazards model, dyspnea, older age, neutrophilia and elevated ultra-tni were independently associated with poor outcomes.in this study, we reported 76 death of covid-19. most patients had pulmonary consolidation and hypoxemia which was difficult to recover. the clinical characteristics of these patients indicated that the age and underlying diseases were the most important risk factors for death. for every 5 years increase in age, the risk of death increased by 1.55. the most common underlying disease was hypertension, followed by cardiovascular disease, diabetes, copd, malignant tumors, and kidney disease. the effects of age and comorbidities have also been addressed in other cohorts of patients with covid-19 4,5 . the presence of cancer or diabetes mellitus was related to a higher mortality rate or an adverse outcome in other studies 4 , which could predispose to superimposed nosocomial pneumonia due to staphylococcus aureus or other agents in these already critically ill patients, although this was not observed in our patients.however, the presence of copd, chronic renal failure, cardiovascular disease or hypertension was related to a higher mortality rate in our data.the patients with underlying disease of lung, heart, and kidney are more vulnerable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), most likely because angiotensin converting enzyme ii (ace2) protein has an abundant expression in many kinds of cells, such as renal tubular epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, heart, artery smooth muscle cells 9 . the coronavirus has a three-dimensional structure of spike j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f protein, which is closely bound to human cell receptor ace2. therefore, the cells with ace2 expression may act as target cells and be susceptible to covid-19 infection, such as type ii alveolar cells (at2) in the lung 10 .in terms of laboratory tests, the count of lymphocytes in most patients was reduced.this result suggests that covid-19 is a viral disease characterized by decreased lymphocyte count, like those recently reported 4, 5, 11 . although lymphopenia has been commonly observed, the absolute lymphocyte count was not associated with poor outcome in our study. most patients' albumin levels and 84.8% hemoglobin levels were decreased, which indicates that malnutrition is common to elderly patients. elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were prevalent on admission in our cohort. high levels of d-dimer was found in more than half of patients with infection. these findings are quite different from those associated with pneumonia caused by common bacterial pathogens, but similar to those previously observed in patients with sars-cov infection 12, 13 . the routine blood test and pct were used to reflect changes in the inflammatory response in covid-19. increased white blood cell and neutrophils count were observed in 30.64% and 33.33% of patients. in particular, a high neutrophil count was an independent predictor for poor outcome. neutrophilia was observed during the cytokine storm induced by virus infection [14] [15] [16] . in the study of betsy et al, after autopsy they showed neutrophils infiltrating lung in the context of a cytokine storm triggered ards and caused organ damage and mortality in covid-which will seriously damage the lung function and resulted in dyspnea and acute respiratory failure when fluid builds up in the air sacs in lungs. elevated levels of ultra-tni was more commonly seen in covid-19. cardiac complications were common in patients with pneumonia in our cohort. the high level of ultra-tni was another independent predictor for poor outcome. the present understanding of the human cardiovascular response to infections, including pneumonia, is derived mainly from studies of critically ill patients with septic shock 17 . further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis of sepsis in covid-19 illness.in the largest case series to date of covid-19, a total of 1,023 deaths have occurred among 44,672 confirmed cases for an overall case fatality rate of 2.3% 3 , and the ≥80 age group had the highest case fatality rate of all age groups at 14.8%. however, in our case series,≥ 60 years old age group had a case fatality rate of 37.3% which is much higher. the possible explanation is that the cases in our cohort are from the stage of the epidemic outbreak. most of the patients have to be isolated at home without medical support due to a lack of inpatient beds in the hospital. two-third of patients in our studies had received empirical therapy out of hospital over ten days before their admission with covid-19. so that their illness was from mild to severe. moreover, the case fatality rate of is unsurprisingly highest among critical cases at 75%. however, it is difficult to calculate the true mortality rate of the disease while the epidemic is continuing and it is impossible to ascertain which of the remaining patients will eventually die or be discharged.until now, no specific antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f infection. once infected, the older patients are harder to treat without supportive care.currently, the approaches to control this disease is to prevent the sources; use of personal protective equipment to reduce the transmission; and early diagnosis, isolation, and supportive treatments. this study suggests that the elderly patients of covid-19 have a rapid course of the disease and a higher case fatality ratio. severe cases on admission were often subjected to higher death rates. according to current diagnostic criteria, viral nucleic acid test results confirmed by rt-pcr assay play a vital role in determining whether to hospitalize a patient. the overall sensitivity of the rt-pcr test for coronavirus in patients was only 59% 18 which needs to be improved. this might be affected by sample quality, the methods of obtaining the samples, as well as the viral load. early diagnosis and supportive care in the hospital are of great importance for the elderly covid-19 patients. the elderly patient with acute dyspnea should seek medical attention immediately.the results of this study must be interpreted with caution and this research is subject to several limitations. this was a retrospective case series study based on data from medical records. clinical notes and patient charts. accordingly, certain information was missing for various patients, and certain data that may have been based on patient memory, such as details concerning exposure history and timing of onset of symptoms, maybe affected by recall bias. not all laboratory tests were done in all patients.laboratory parameter is not all documented in our studies. finally, in an effort to quickly disseminate information to clinicians worldwide, we only assessed short-term outcomes. the follow-up evaluation to determine the long-term repercussions of this in late december 2019, china reported an outbreak of viral pneumonia in wuhan, hubei province, china, which spread rapidly to other areas [1, 2] . it was revealed that the causative agent of the cluster of acute respiratory illness was an rna enveloped beta coronavirus from the sarbecovirus subgenus of coronaviridae's family, which was termed the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) [3] [4] [5] [6] . covid-19 counts as the third outbreak of betacoronaviruses in the twenty-first century, causing a public health crisis of global concern [7, 8] . previous outbreaks of this viral family have been described in 2002 and 2012. the former was a respiratory disease identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), involving 37 countries, and the latter, known as the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) affected 27 countries. the overall mortality rate of these two epidemics of sars-cov and mers-cov was 10 and 37%, respectively [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] .covid-19 is a global concern and has become a significant health problem since the number of infected cases and affected countries has escalated rapidly [13] . on march 11, 2020 , the world health organization (who) confirmed covid-19 a pandemic. as of march 31, 2020, over 800,000 cases of covid have been reported with a death toll of over 39,000 patients and only around 141,000 recovered cases in 199 countries and territories worldwide. among the top-ranking countries, iran was placed in seventh position with over 35,000 confirmed cases and over 2500 deaths, and only around 11,600 recovered cases [14, 15] . however, the actual number of cases may be much higher because of challenges in confirming the cases due to the limited pcr diagnostic test kits and available staff in the hospitals.based on the literature, the incubation period of the disease could be up to 14 days [16] . most cases have mild symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, and myalgia. however, some cases can present with severe conditions such as multiple organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, and pneumonia [17] [18] [19] . based on radiological findings in previous studies, the most frequent ct findings included bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, occasionally with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution [20, 21] . in respect to laboratory data, a decrease in the absolute value of lymphocytes in most patients can be found [22] , indicating that the virus may mainly act on lymphocytes, especially t-cells. damage to t lymphocytes can be a primary factor resulting in exacerbations of patients [23] . in clinical practice, a low absolute value of lymphocytes could assist as a reference index in diagnosing new cases of coronavirus infections. due to the severity of the disease, with over 20% critical patients and mortality rate of about 3%, covid-19 is a global health emergency [24] . therefore, early detection and appropriate treatment of critical cases are of essential importance.at present, there is a lack of information regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of covid-19 patients in the middle east, especially iran, a country which is considered as one of the most important focal points of the disease throughout the world. therefore, this study has been conducted to evaluate the clinical features of covid-19 patients in fars province, southern iran.the center for control and prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) was established on february 20, 2020, to monitor the spread of the covid-19 in fars province, iran's fourth most populated province. the center has been assigned to provide services to five hospitals affiliated by the shiraz university of medical sciences. the approach to the disease was based on iran national health guidelines, adapted from the who guidelines, and the latest studies on covid-19 [25] . the incubation period of covid-19 has been defined as the time of exposure to the onset of illness, which, based on reports from china and all over the world, was assumed to be between 3 to 14 days. a patient with symptoms of fever, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, and possibly respiratory distress is defined as suspected of having covid-19, especially if there was a positive history of close contact with a highly suspected or confirmed covid-19 patient, or having a travel history to a covid-19 affected country or city [26] . confirmed covid-19 cases were admitted and quarantined in centers allocated for covid-19 diagnosis and under the management of shiraz university of medical sciences.the severity of disease was based on the american thoracic society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia as severe and non-severe, similar to other studies [27, 28] , which in our research was the reference for intensive care unit (icu) or non-icu admission.the epidemiological and clinical (including clinical records, laboratory data, as well as data regarding the chest high resolution ct (hrct) scans) data of all confirmed covid-19 patients from february 20, 2020, to march 20, 2020, in allocated centers for covid-19 diagnosis and under the management of shiraz university of medical sciences were collected. data were recruited consecutively from the available patients and also extracted from the hospital records in the cases of discharged patients. all physical examinations were performed by a solo physician. furthermore, the primary chest ct scan was reviewed independently by an unaccompanied trained specialized radiologist who was blind to the primary impression, clinical symptoms and the patient's outcome.the ethics committee of shiraz university of medical sciences approved the current study with the ethical code number: ir.sums.rec.1398.1378. confidentiality of patient information was guaranteed and protected by recording only birth date, gender, marital status, occupation, comorbid disease. the goal of the study was explained to the patients and written informed consents were obtained from them.real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was used to confirm suspected cases. rt-pcr assays were performed following the protocol established by the who [25] . nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected and tested for sars-cov-2 for each patient. under a biosafety cabinet and according to laboratory biosafety guidelines, the rnas were extracted, using qiaamp™ viral rna mini kit from qiagen™ according to the manufacturer's instructions. with e-gene and rdrp-gene probe/primer and superscript™ iii platinum, one-step qrt-pcr kit of invitrogen company mixtures was prepared. the mixtures transferred to roche light cycler™ 96 and applied biosystem abi step one plus™ real time thermal cyclers with positive control and no template control (ntc) as well as an internal control. after 45 cycles the produced graphs were observed, any rise after the noise and before cycle 32 was considered as positive for sars-cov 2 [29, 30] .the collected data was summarized as means (±sd: standard deviation) or medians (with interquartile ranges). for particular variables, the percentage of patients in each group was calculated. unpaired student's t-test, chi-square test, or fisher's exact test was used to compare the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients as appropriate. a p. value of less than 0.05 was considered as indicating statistical significance. all the statistical analyses were performed by the statistical package for social sciences (spss inc., chicago, illinois, usa) version 26.0.the study population consisted of 113 confirmed covid-19 cases, with a mean age of 53.75 years (sd = 16.58; range 20-99). the patients consisted of 71 (62.8%) males and 42 (37.2%) females. among the patients in our study, 11 (9.7%) were admitted to intensive care units due to the severity of their disease. the average time between the initiation of symptoms until hospital admission was 5.63 days, and the average duration of hospitalization was 6.20 days. the average number of days from the start of symptoms until the development of dyspnea, and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) was 5.63, 0.5, and 2 days, respectively. among the patients in our study 44 (38.9%) had one or more coexisting medical conditions alongside covid-19; the most frequent were hypertension (22: 19.5%), diabetes (16: 14.2%), and cardiovascular diseases (16: 14.2%) ( table 1) .among the hospitalized patients, the most common symptoms at onset of disease were fatigue (66:4%), cough (64.6%), and fever (59.3%); while the less common were hemoptysis (6.2%), and conjunctival congestion (15%) ( table 1) .based on the patients' vital signs on admission, 77 (68.1%) of our patients had no fever. also, 12 (10.6%) had elevated heart rates (> 100/min), 2 (1.8%) had elevated respiratory rate (> 24/min), and 7 (6.3%) had elevated blood pressure on admission. these values did not differ between severe and non-severe patients and were all lower among the deceased patients, although not significant. the oxygen saturation of the patients was also measured on admission, which showed 39 (34.5%) of the patients had an o 2 saturation of less than 90%. also, the mean saturation of o 2 was significantly lower among the icu admitted patients (p = 0.001) and was also significantly lower among the deceased patients (p < 0.05) ( table 2 ).in terms of the lung examinations, only seven patients (25.9%) had significant rales, which were significantly correlated with the severity of the disease. among the other signs of infection, the most common were throat congestion (17: 15%), and swelling of the tonsils (8:7.1%) ( table 1) .numerous variations in laboratory findings were seen among the severe and non-severe, as well as the deceased and living patients (table 3) . icu admitted patients who had significantly higher lymphocyte count than non-icu patients, although this correlation was not significant with the mortality rate of the patients in our study. the severe group and the deceased group had higher levels of white blood cells and neutrophil count. although lower levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count were detected compared to the nonsevere and living groups, these differences were not statistically significant. based on coagulation tests, there were significantly higher international normalized ratio (inr) levels and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (ptt) among the severe and non-severe group (p < 0.001); however, the significance of this finding among the deceased group was only valid for inr (p < 0.001).among the biochemical tests, the severe group showed higher blood urea nitrogen (bun), creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (ast), c reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) compared to the nonsevere group, although it was not significant ( table 3) .the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (nlr) was calculated and compared based on the severity and mortality in the patients in our study. results showed a significantly higher nlr among the icu admitted group (severe group) and the expired group (p = 0.007 and 0.01, respectively). this difference was also significant among patients above 50 years of age (p = 0.023 and 0.021). however, the average nlr among patients above 50 years with icu admission was 11.46 radiological evaluation revealed 4 (4.9%) patients with normal ct scans, none of whom were among the severe or mortality group. these patients were dominantly male (75%) and under 50 years of age, although no significant correlation was achieved between gender and age with normal ct finding. the most common abnormality was ground-glass opacity (77: 93.9%), followed by consolidation (48: 58.5%). also, radiological findings of crazy paving were significantly more frequent in nonsevere and living patients (p < 0.05) ( table 4 and fig. 1 ).the main treatments initiated for the patients consisted of antiviral therapy (113: 100%), antibiotic therapy (112: 99.1%), and corticosteroid (5: 4.4%). also, based on oxygen support administered for the patients, the majority of non-severe patients used nasal cannula (96.8%). in addition, for severe cases, other modalities such as invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, or high flow masks were used according to the condition of patients in our study. patients using invasive mechanical ventilation had significantly higher mortality in our study (p < 0.01) ( table 1) .based on the prognosis of the disease, an overall 8% mortality rate was documented among the patients in our study, in which the majority were among the icu admitted patients (5: 55.6%). also, 68 (60.2%) of our patients achieved total recovery, and 7 (6.2%) were discharged with follow-up and home isolation.based on the results of this study up to march 30, 2020, a total number of 113 patients were admitted to shiraz hospitals, the capital of fars province, iran, with a diagnosis of covid-19. the mean age of hospitalized patients was 53 years old, with a male to female ratio of 1.6:1. of these patients, 29 (25.7%) are still hospitalized, 68 (60.2%) were discharged, 7 (6.2%) were discharged with outpatient treatment and 9 (8%) died. 11 (9.7%) cases were admitted to the icu due to the severity of the disease. virological findings indicated that some asian populations may potentially be more susceptible to covid-19 than other races [31] [32] [33] . chan et al. confirmed the person-to-person transmission of the virus [16] . our results showed that covid-19 infects men more than women; these findings are consistent with the findings of the previous studies [1, [34] [35] [36] . in early reports from china, the susceptibility of men contracting the disease was believed to have a relationship with their link to the seafood market as most workers there were men [34] . nevertheless, as the disease spread to other countries throughout the world, this theory was weakened as men were also more susceptible to the disease in other countries. several theories have been proposed in this respect; li et al. reported that the male to female ratio can be attributed to the role of sex hormones and protection of the x chromosome, which plays an essential role in adaptive and innate immunity [36] . however, it may be assumed that due to iranian culture, men tend to have more person to person contact as they work outside the house more than women who usually stay at home and do household chores.taking the patients' age into consideration, most patients with severe conditions were aged over 50 years. they had comorbid diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which is aligned with the data that has been previously reported [19, 34] . fang et al. described a theory stating that since the coronavirus binds to its target through an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace-2) expressed by epithelial cells in kidney, lung and blood vessels, the infection can facilitate an increased risk of developing severe covid-19 in individuals who take ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii type-i receptor blockers (arbs) and also among diabetic patients as they tend to have an increase in ace-2 expression [37] [38] [39] .putting aside the typical symptoms such as fever, cough, and myalgia [6, 40, 41] , our data revealed that many patients presented with atypical symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo. in a study carried out by lechien et al. [42] in europe, headache, loss of smell, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction were among the most common symptoms of patients following typical symptoms. moreover, spinato et al. [43] . however, due to the design of our study and incomplete hospital records these data were not collected in our study. these data suggest that aside from the focus on typical symptoms, atypical presentations of the disease must be kept in mind as most of our patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms observed in earlier diagnosis and facilitated prevention of the spread of the disease. moreover, these differences in the presentation of the virus might be due to alterations in the virus genotype or the level of expression of the virus receptors, including ace2, in which necessitates further studies and evaluation. based on our data, those who had lower o 2 saturation on admission and presented with rales on physical examination were significantly associated with being severely ill and achieving poorer prognosis. furthermore, those who were severely ill had lower heart rates and blood pressure. these findings can be explained by the theory that coronavirus affects not only the respiratory system but also the cardiovascular system. based on published studies, covid-19 patients have had high levels of myocardial injury biomarkers in their blood samples [4, 34] . furthermore, zheng et al. stated that this myocardial injury might be related to ace2 which is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system as well as the respiratory system [44] .in terms of laboratory data, abnormalities included leukocytosis in 10.8%, lymphopenia in 12.6%, thrombocytopenia in 15.6%, pt and ptt in 77.9 and 45.8% were seen in the patients. patients with severe conditions had higher increases in c -reactive protein and esr levels, and those who died had higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase. furthermore, severe cases of covid-19 had more laboratory abnormalities than those who were admitted in general wards. the same results have been reported in previous studies, except for the fact that the number of cases with lymphopenia in our study was lower than other studies [1, 28, 34, 45, 46] .it is worth mentioning that in our study, the nlr ratio was significantly higher in those who were admitted to the icu and those who died, but the average level of nlr in most patients was higher than 3.13. therefore, we assume that a higher cut off in approach to covid-19 patients based on the nlr ratio might be beneficial as lie et al. reported the appropriate cutoff of 3.13 [47] . the overall results of laboratory data suggest that the novel coronavirus infection is associated with the activation of immune system responses with an impact on lymphocytes and the activation of the coagulation cascade. thus, further studies in this area can be beneficial in the treatment of covid-19.based on our data, 4 (4.9%) of our patients, who were under 50 years old and not severely ill, had normal chest ct scans. hu et al. also reported that 29.2% of the younger asymptomatic patients in his study had normal radiologic findings [48] . most abnormal radiologic findings consisted of ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and crazy paving presented mostly in both lungs and peripheral areas. these data, which is consistent with other publications, suggest that ct scan can play a crucial role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the severity of the disease [28, 34, 40] .the fatality rate of patients included in the current study was 8%, which is quite near to the national mortality rate in iran which was reported to be 7% based on documented covid-19 patients but was significantly higher fig. 1 (a) axial ct scans from an above 60 year-old male; selected cut from non-contrast chest ct of lung window. sub pleural crescent-shaped ground-glass opacities as well as smooth interlobular septal thickening can be seen in both lungs, involving mostly peripheral zone; (b) axial ct scans from an above 60 year-old male; selected image from non-contrast chest ct scans, lung window. extensive consolidation with can be seen in both lower lobes with air bronchograms; (c) and (d) axial ct scans from an above 50 year-old male at the level of carina;

mild pleural effusion is seen bilaterally (yellow arrows); (h) axial ct scans from an above 50-year old female; selected image from non-contrast chest ct scans, lung window. multiple patchy consolidation in both lower lobe;

(j) axial ct scans from an above 50 year-old male; selected image from non-contrast chest ct scans, lung window. ground-glass opacities affecting the bilateral lung field, reverse halo sign (ground-glass opacity surrounded by denser consolidation of crescentic shape) in left lower lobe (arrow), pleural effusion is seen bilaterally compared to most studies from china [34, 49, 50] , although some of which reported higher or equal mortality rate in hospitalized patients [36, 41] . given that china had a history of sars outbreak in 2003, they were able to successfully control the disease with the help of their previous experience and appropriate leadership. inadequate awareness towards the disease in the early stages, lack of medical protection, high infectivity of the virus, and lack of treatment measures in iran led to a rapid increase in the number of patients and mortality rate [51] . moreover, since those who developed mild symptoms did not seek medical treatment, the actual mortality rate in the society might be even lower.controlling the source of infection, taking preventive measures, early diagnosis, isolation of suspicious cases, and supportive care have been taken into consideration to cease the spread of the virus. although many randomized controlled trials have been initiated around the world, no specific treatment or vaccine has of yet been proposed for covid-19. antiviral and antibiotic therapies have been used to treat covid-19; however, none of them were found to be properly beneficial [34, 46] . in the present study, all of the patients received antiviral therapy, all except one received antibiotic treatment, and 5 cases (4.4%) received corticosteroids.as with any hospital-based study, this study has its own limitations. firstly, we encountered some missing data as there were variations in patients' documents in two hospitals due to the limited time and shortage of trained medical staff. secondly, some patients were still being admitted to the hospital during the time of writing the manuscript, which could have affected the outcome results. thirdly, due to the limited number of patients and given the fact that most patients with mild symptoms were not hospitalized and were not included in the study, further community-based studies are justified to explore and clarify the different aspects of this disease in iran, as one of the most important focal points of the disease.in this multicenter case series of 113 hospitalized patients, an 8% mortality rate for the covid-19 patients in south of iran was reported. some patients developed atypical symptoms at the time of admission which makes the diagnosis difficult. finding the source of infection and studying the behavior of covid-19 is crucial for understanding the pandemic. furthermore, early diagnosis, improving detection methods, timely isolation, and proper treatment are the key factors in fighting this infection. coronaviruses are rna viruses, and may infect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and central nervous systems of humans, livestock species, avian species, many mammals, and wild animals. [1] in humans, infection by four coronaviruses, namely hcov-229e, hcov-oc43, hcov-nl63, and hcov-hku1, usually lead to mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. [2] however, other coronaviruses, such as those associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers), may cause severe respiratory disease, and have caused a total of more than 10,000 laboratory-confirmed cases globally in the past two decades, with a 10% and 34.4% case-fatality rate, respectively. [3, 4] in december 2019, a novel coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), emerged in wuhan, hubei, china, with clinical manifestations in humans resembling that of viral pneumonia. [5] by february 25, 2020 , about 77,780 confirmed cases have been identified in china, with 2666 deaths. worryingly, 2459 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) have now been identified outside of china. [6] symptoms of infection are non-specific, and include fever, cough, and myalgia, [7] with diarrhea, with or without the subsequent development of dyspnea. [8] severe cases with respiratory distress, sepsis, and septic shock have been reported. [9] during the sars epidemic of 2003, therapeutic systemic glucocorticoids were widely administered in patients who were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), and who subsequently developed severe respiratory disease. one cohort study of patients during the sars outbreak showed that the use of pulsed high-dose methylprednisolone was associated with clinical improvement in patients with sars. [10] in another study of 20 patients with sars, certain cytokine levels (interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and th1 chemokine interferon-g-inducible protein-10) were found to be reduced after 5 to 8 days of glucocorticoid therapy. [11] however, a previous retrospective study indicated that pulsed doses of methylprednisolone was a risk factor associated with increased 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 26.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.4-154.8; p = 0.001). [12] in addition, a further retrospective observational study found that glucocorticoid therapy in patients with mers was associated with delayed middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) rna clearance. [13] the clinical, therapeutic, and other effects of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in patients with covid-19 is not currently clear, and the case for and against the use of systemic glucocorticoids in severe cases of covid-19 warrants further investigation.our study proposes to investigate the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in patients with severe covid-19. our major objective is to observe whether there is a clinical necessity, or therapeutic justification, for the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with severe covid-19.the study was approved by the ethics committee of the chongqing public health medical center (no. 2020-003-01-ky). we will publish the results of our study in medical journals at the conclusion of the study. no patient names will appear in any published articles, and no access to the data may be obtained, with the exception of the researchers and members of the hospital ethics committee.this study will be conducted as an open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial. we will enroll 48 subjects from the chongqing public health medical center for this study. this protocol has been written and devised in accordance with the standard protocol items: recommendations for interventional trials statement. [14] the enrolment, intervention, and assessment processes are described in figure 1 .after obtaining informed consent, all subjects in each group will be invited for 28 days of follow-up, which will be scheduled at four consecutive visit points [ table 1 ]. blood and urine samples will be collected for laboratory testing, including hematologic analysis, urinalysis, clinical chemistry studies, electrolytes, coagulation testing, myocardial enzymes, c-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, cluster of differentiation 4 (cd4) cell counts, cd8 cell counts, blood gas analysis, and 2019-ncov real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). all items considered and tested for during the follow-up period are listed in table 1 .adverse events (aes) are defined as undesirable outcomes experienced by patients during the study, whether or not related to treatment with glucocorticoids. all aes described by patients or observed by the medical team will be duly documented. all serious aes will be documented in detail, and the investigators will be notified as soon as possible. aes will be recorded in both the clinical history of the patient and the case report form, with appropriate medical terminology. all aes will be expeditiously resolved. short-term glucocorticoid therapy usually causes mild side effects, including hypokalemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension, pancreatitis, cutaneous, hematologic, immunologic, and neuropsychologic effects. [15] the above mild side effects are reversible upon discontinuation of glucocorticoids. side effects associated with long-term glucocorticoid use are not considered relevant for this study, because of the short duration of the glucocorticoids prescribed in this study (3 days the diagnosis of severe covid-19 in subjects will have to meet the following criteria [16] :(1) identification of 2019-ncov via rt-pcr in blood samples, sputum samples, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or nasopharyngeal swab samples. (2) having at least one of the following conditions: a. respiratory distress (≥30 times/min); b. oxygen saturation 93% at rest; c. arterial partial pressure of oxygen (pao 2 )/fraction of inspiration o 2 (fio 2 ) 300 mmhg (1 mmhg = 0.133 kpa); d. respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; e. septic shock development; f. critical organ failure requiring intensive care unit care.subjects will be included in our study if they satisfy the following criteria:(1) aged 18 years or over;(2) severe covid-19;(3) be willing to give informed consent.subjects will be excluded from the study if they satisfy the following criteria:(1) are allergic or intolerant to any therapeutic drugs used in this study; (2) pregnant or lactating women;(3) presence of severe systemic illness that may affect the effectiveness or safety evaluation for this study.microsoft excel 2013 (microsoft corporation, redmond, wa, usa) will be used to generate random numbers for each subject with consent. once eligibility has been confirmed, the investigators or designers will randomize the subjects into a control group and an intervention group, at a 1:1 ratio.all results will be recorded and entered twice independently. all data will be documented on case report forms and immediately recorded in the excel database. any missing values will be verified to ensure completeness and accuracy of data as much as possible. data that are obviously abnormal or beyond the upper limit of normal (laboratory items exceeding 20% of the normal value) must be explained, and the necessary explanation must be given by the physician. drop-outs and aes will be recorded in a timely manner, and drugs used for trial will be supplied, stored, distributed, and recycled according to relevant regulations. after the data lock record is signed by the principal researcher, sponsor, statistical analyst, and data manager, the data administrator will perform a database lock.all subjects will receive conventional treatment for covid-19 according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of covid-19 (version 6). patients randomized to the intervention group will receive methylprednisolone (intravenous injection, 1-2 mg/kg/day for 3 days), whereas those in the control group will not receive glucocorticoid therapy. discontinuation of the regimen may occur for those participants who have no substantial improvement after a full course of treatment, or for those subjects whose clinical condition deteriorate during the course of treatment.the primary endpoint is the change in sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) at 3 days after randomization. [17] the secondary endpoints are: proportion of mechanical ventilation use at 2 and 4 weeks, mortality at 2 and 4 weeks, and duration of hospitalization.this trial is a randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups, without masking, and with a 1:1 allocation ratio. up to now, no randomized controlled trials have evaluated changes in sofa scores in patients with 2019-ncov infection with or without glucocorticoid therapy. the sample-size calculation is based on the primary hypothesis of detecting a reduction of 40% in sofa scores between the treatment and non-treatment groups after 3 days of glucocorticoid therapy. pass software version 15 (ncss, llc; kaysville, ut, usa) will be used with a power of 80% and a level of 95% confidence. considering a dropout rate of 5%, the sample size is estimated to be 24 cases in each group. a randomized controlled trial in 2003 aimed to compare the plasma sars-cov rna concentrations in patients in an early hydrocortisone-treated group with patients in a placebo group. [18] this study only enrolled a total of 17 subjects because it was conducted at the end of the sars outbreak, and fewer appropriate patients were available to be recruited. taking into account the uncertainty of the duration of the outbreak, the final sample size may be adjusted. unlike wuhan, chongqing currently has a relatively small number of confirmed cases of covid-19, and an even smaller number of severe cases of covid-19. it is hoped that we do eventually recruit a cohort of 48 patients for our study, but we may have to settle for an even smaller cohort, should suitable subjects not be available.the primary outcome analysis will be presented for the intervention group and control group using descriptive statistics. the normality of the data distribution will be evaluated by the kolmogorov-smirnov test. continuous variables will be described as mean values with standard deviation (mean ± standard deviation), and will be analyzed using the t test for independent samples. categorical variables will be analyzed using the chisquared test or fisher's exact test. to verify the magnitude of the difference, the relative risk of success will be estimated in the intervention group and control group, and its confidence interval will be set at 95%. values of p < 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significance. all the analyses will be performed using the spss software version 24 (spss inc., chicago, il, usa).since 2019-ncov was first reported in december 2019, [19] it has attracted global attention owing to its similarity to sars-cov and mers-cov in causing fatal respiratory disease, and its potential for propagating large-scale human infection and economic disruption. systemic glucocorticoid therapy could be considered for critically ill patients with covid-19, but their impact on clinical outcomes is uncertain. [16] available data on systemic glucocorticoid therapy among coronavirus-infected patients mainly comes from studies of patients with sars and mers, but whether glucocorticoid therapy is definitively beneficial in the clinical management of these two coronavirus infections is still being debated. [13, 20, 21] glucocorticoid therapy was used in the treatment of severe sars because early anecdotal experience supported it, and radiologic findings and histologic features of critically ill patients with sars were similar to those of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). [22] [23] [24] [25] as early as march 2003, china first summarized its experience in the management of sars, and suggested that high-dose glucocorticoids should be used if patients had fever persisting for more than 3 days, or radiologic findings were suggestive of persistent lung involvement or progressive deterioration. [26] there were three different regimens used by physicians in hong kong, china including methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg qid or 2-4 mg/kg tid iv followed by oral prednisolone for varying periods and of disparate dosages, as per clinical evaluation), hydrocortisone (2 mg/kg qid or 4 mg/kg tid iv followed by oral prednisolone for varying periods and doses as per clinical evaluation), and pulsed methylprednisolone (500 mg iv daily for 5 days followed by maintenance oral prednisolone 50 mg bid, reduced to 20-30 mg daily on day 21 and as per clinical evaluation). [27] some suggested glucocorticoid therapeutic doses during the sars outbreak were very high, approximating the treatment doses for acute severe asthma, and some prescribed doses were similar to those prescribed for organ rejection in transplant patients, or for ards. [23] one study compared pulsed glucocorticoid therapy (methylprednisolone ≥500 mg/day) with non-pulsed glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone <500 mg/day) therapy, finding that pulsed glucocorticoid therapy appeared to be a more efficacious, with patients using pulsed glucocorticoid therapy having lower oxygen requirements, better radiographic outcomes, and decreased likelihood of requiring rescue. unfortunately, the stated study was not a randomized controlled trial, and is thus open to the possibility of bias having an impact on outcomes. [23] however, there were also staunch advocates for not using systemic glucocorticoids in these patients. one systematic review of studies on patients with sars-cov, including 29 studies documenting glucocorticoid use, found 25 studies that were inconclusive regarding the role of the adjunctive use of glucocorticoids, and four studies demonstrated that the use of systemic glucocorticoids in patients with sars may cause possible harm. [28] a prospective, randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial compared early hydrocortisone treatment (before day 7 of the illness) with placebo, finding that early hydrocortisone therapy was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load. [18] meanwhile, many possible complications of glucocorticoid use, such as profound immunosuppression, with the possible emergence of severe commensal and other viral and bacterial infections, invasive fungal infections, osteonecrosis, and psychosis may occur with prolonged and high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] glucocorticoid therapy was also commonly used for critically ill patients with mers. in one study, hypoxemic patients with mers-cov pneumonia who had moderate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure were initiated on glucocorticoid therapy. [13] in these patients, there was no difference in 90-day mortality, and these patients were associated with delayed mers-cov rna clearance. many patients with severe mers were treated with systemic high-dose glucocorticoids intending to reverse the progression of respiratory distress and to prevent lung chinese medical journal 2020;vol(no) www.cmj.org fibrosis. however, this approach has not been proven to be successful. [35] one study, including a total of 314 patients with symptomatic mers-cov, found that glucocorticoid use was associated with increased mortality in these patients. [36] a retrospective cohort study compared 151 patients in the glucocorticoid group with 158 patients in the non-glucocorticoid group, finding that mortality in the glucocorticoid group was similar to that of the nonglucocorticoid group, but that glucocorticoid therapy was associated with delayed mers-cov rna clearance, after adjustment for baseline and time-varying confounding factors. [13] after infection with 2019-ncov occurs, some patients develop mild symptoms, but a significant fraction of patients progress to severe ards and require intensive care. [7, 37] the use of glucocorticoids in patients with ards is still controversial because of divergent results in the existing literature. [38] high-dose glucocorticoid is one of the most frequently used adjuncts in ards (17.9%) in 50 countries, even though their effectiveness in the management of acute lung injury is not yet clear. [39] one systematic review conducted an analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials, and demonstrated that compared with the placebo group, prolonged glucocorticoid treatment did improve clinical outcomes. [40] another randomized controlled trial showed that glucocorticoid therapy could down-regulate ards-related inflammation, and was associated with significant improvements in lung and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, as well as reduce mechanical ventilation duration and intensive care unit hospital admission duration. [41] studies by meduri et al [42, 43] found that prolonged methylprednisolone treatment may complement positive modulation of systemic inflammation by inducing recovery from induced glucocorticoid resistance, and co-existing decreased production of endogenous glucocorticoids. [42, 43] animal experiments in recent years have provided evidence for the use of glucocorticoids to reduce inflammation, the attenuation of acute lung injury, and reduction in mortality during the acute phase of severe disease. [44, 45] however, other studies have suggested that glucocorticoid therapy in ards is not necessary, and may even aggravate the clinical picture. the use of hydrocortisone improves lung function in sepsis-associated ards, but no significant survival benefit has been observed in these patients. [46] a higher mortality rate has been observed in patients with ards who took high-dose glucocorticoids within 7 days after hospital admission, compared with those who were treated without high-dose glucocorticoid. [47] existing studies on ards have not assessed the effects of glucocorticoids in identical types of patients, or identical processes of the disease. [48] therefore, the results for these studies cannot be considered to be congruent. adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy in specific diseases causing ards, such as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, has been shown to reduce mortality in adult patients. [49] additionally, the dosage of the glucocorticoid used needs to be factored in.high-dose glucocorticoid therapy may increase ventilator dependence, and may possibly induce a worse outcome. [50] the development of osteonecrosis was discovered in patients receiving high-dose glucocorticoids during the sars epidemic in 2003, and the number of osteonecrotic lesions was directly related to the dosage of the glucocorticoid prescribed. [51, 52] additionally, high-dose glucocorticoid use is one of the causes for neuropsychiatric outcomes in patients with sars. [53] it has been noted that if lung injury has been effectively controlled, appropriate doses of glucocorticoids based on disease severity may be beneficial for better outcomes of sars. [10, 21] in our study, we will investigate whether the use of mid-dose and shortcourse adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy to treat severe covid-19 is advantageous, safe, and effective.this work was supported by the chongqing special research project for prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia (no. cstc2020jscx-fyzx0074).none.severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) is a novel coronavirus first detected in wuhan, china, that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) . 1 since initial virus detection, more than 1,350,000 cases of covid-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with the first reported cases in the lombardy region, northern italy, occurring on end of february, 2020. 2 the number of cases in our region continues to rise; as of april 2, 2020, there had been 46,071 confirmed sars-cov-2 infections and 7,600 deaths. 3 at least seven relatively large-scale case studies from china have reported the clinical features of patients with covid-19. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] these data indicate that 2-11% of patients with covid-19 had preexisting liver diseases. recently, grasselli et al, reported that, among the first 1,591 patients admitted to intensive care units (icu) in lombardy due to sars-cov-2 infection, 3% had a history of chronic liver disease. 11 patients with pre-existing cirrhosis might be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection because of their systemic immunocompromised status. moreover, in these patients, the severity of covid-19 and the rate of complications, potentially leading to increased 6 liver-related mortality, might be more pronounced than in general population. this hypothesis derives from studies on bacterial infections, a common cause of decompensation in patients with cirrhosis; conversely, data on the impact of viral infections have been less studied in this population. 12 it has been reported that viral influenza may increase the risk of decompensation in cirrhotic patients, and recently a high risk of hepatic function deterioration during the pandemic of 2009 h1n1 influenza virus, even in patients with stable liver disease, has been reported. 13 in the study by premkumar et al, 82% of patients with cirrhosis and a/h1n1/09 died of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome despite timely antiviral treatment, with the severity of both respiratory distress and kidney impairment being independent predictors of mortality. 13 since data on covid-19 in patients with cirrhosis are lacking, we performed a multicenter retrospective study to describe the demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics of cirrhotic patients with sars-cov-2 infection in the lombardy region and their outcomes.we included cirrhotic patients with laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection who were managed in nine hospitals in lombardy, northern italy, between march 1 st and march 31 th , 2020. therefore, all information registered by 3 april 2020 (data-lock) were entered into the database.a confirmed case of sars-cov-2 was defined by a positive result on a reverse-transcriptasepolymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) assay of a specimen collected on a nasopharyngeal swab, as previously described. 5 demographic and clinical data, including clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, laboratory and radiologic results during covid-19 management as well as administered antiviral therapies and anti-thrombotic prophylaxis, were collected. all laboratory tests and radiologic assessments were performed at treating physician discretion. data of the last outpatient clinic visit before covid-19 were also collected for comparison. when sars-cov-2 infection occurred during hospitalization, data of covid-19 diagnosis were compared to those collected at hospital admission. liver disease (meld, clif-of, clif-c) scores were assessed. liver injury was defined as alanine aminotransferase (alt) level > 30 u/l for males and 19 u/l for females in those patients with normal alt levels at last outpatient visit. 14 hepatic flare was defined as alt level ≥5 x upper limit of normality. acute on chronic liver failure (aclf) at diagnosis of covid-19 was retrospectively defined and graded according to the easl-clif definition. 15 any coexisting conditions were obtained from medical records. scrutiny for other causes of liver function deterioration included history of over the counter medication use, over-diuresis, alcohol intake and use of hepatotoxic medications.to assess the impact of sars-cov-2 infection on survival of hospitalized cirrhotic patients, we compared the survival of this cohort with that of a control group which included cirrhotic patients hospitalized in the last year for liver decompensation due to bacterial infection in two units 8 involved in this multicenter study. these control patients, identified from the discharge database, were consecutively selected among those diagnosed with cirrhosis and infection (i.e. pneumonia, urinary tract infection, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or spontaneous bacteraemia), all their data retrieved from hospital records.to compare the mortality of covid-19 patients with and without cirrhosis, we retrospectively extracted the mortality rates due to covid-19 in patients without cirrhosis hospitalized at the foundation irccs ca' granda ospedale maggiore policlinico within the same period. finally, sars-cov-2-related mortality data for general population were retrieved from the regional report of the italian istituto superiore di sanità (iss), and used as benchmark.descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data; results have been reported as median and interquartile range (iqr) or mean and standard deviation, as appropriate. categorical variables have been compared using the χ 2 or the fisher's exact tests; continuous variables have been compared using the student-t-test, the mann-whitney u-test or the kruskall-wallis test, when appropriate. all tests were two-sided and used a significance level of 0.05. survival curves were estimated by the kaplan-meier method, cox regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with 30-day mortality. data handling and analysis were performed using stata software (release 7.0, stata corporation, college station, tx). at sars-cov-2 diagnosis, 44 (88%) patients presented at least one symptom: 18 (36%) presented with cough, 21 (42%) with polypnea or shortness of breath, 32 (64%) with fever and 11 (22%) with acute hepatic encephalopathy ( table 2 ). six (12%) patients were asymptomatic at presentation: in these cases, nasopharyngeal swab was performed according to surveillance protocols (i.e. contact with positive subjects).finally, 48 (96%) patients were hospitalized, which included 10 patients already hospitalized for other reasons and 38 who required admission for sars-cov-2 infection itself.thirty-two (64%) patients needed non-invasive respiratory support during hospitalization, while two patients were admitted to icu and received invasive mechanical ventilation (table 2 ). in detail, an acute respiratory distress syndrome was present in 26 (52%) patients: mild (200 mmhg < pao2/fio2 ≤ 300 mmhg) in 12, moderate (100 mmhg < pao2/fio2 ≤ 200 mmhg) in 11 and severe (pao2/fio2 < 100 mmhg) in 3 patients. moreover, 4 (8%) patients experienced hypotension and needed vasopressors.overall, 26 (52%) patients received specific anti-sars-cov-2 treatment: 9 (18%) received hydroxychloroquine alone, 3 (6%) received antiviral therapy with lopinavir-ritonavir, and 14 (28%) received both anti-viral treatment and hydroxychloroquine; none of the patients have been treated with tocilizumab or remdesivir. only mild gastrointestinal adverse events were reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, whilst one patient showed a mild increase in alt values. in one case, treated with hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir-ritonavir, a prolongation of electrocardiographic qt interval occurred, leading to treatment discontinuation, however without sequelae.thromboprophylaxis with heparin (mainly with low molecular weight heparin, lmwh) was started at covid-19 diagnosis in 80% of patients, with two minor haemorrhagic events (epistaxis and haematuria were still hospitalized [median stay length at data-lock 15 (9-33) days].when compared to the last outpatient visit [median time-lapse 1.7 (1.0-4.0) months], or to blood tests performed at admission, but before sars-cov-2 infection, most parameters had changed at the time of covid-19 diagnosis. bilirubin, inr, alt and creatinine (p=0.007) significantly increased (p=0.026, p=0.042, and p=0.024, respectively), whilst albumin levels significantly decreased (p=0.0003), thus influencing both cpt and meld scores ( table 3 ). the distribution of cpt scores significantly changed (p=0.05, table 3 the 30-day cumulative probability of overall mortality was 34% [95% confidence interval (ci) 23-49] ( figure 1a) . the corresponding features for covid-19-and liver-related mortality were 25% (95% ci 15-40) and 12% (95% ci 5-26), respectively ( figure 1b) . predictors of mortality are reported in table 4 . in the multivariate analysis, only clif-of (hr 1.426, 95%ci 1.122-1.668, p≤0.0001) and moderate/severe lung failure (hr 1.608, 95%ci 1.079-2.395, p=0.019) independently predicted mortality. when clif-c was introduced, meld, clif-c and moderate/severe respiratory failure remained as independent predictors. meld and clif independently predicted mortality also when analysed as dichotomous variables. figure 2a and 2b show the cumulative probability of mortality according to meld≥15 and clif-of>9 at diagnosis.meld≥15 at development of sars-cov-2 infection occurred in 2/33 (6%), 5/10 (50%) and 6/7 (86%) of patients with meld scores of 6, 7-11 and >11 at last record before sars-cov-2 infection, respectively (p<0.0001). table 5 shows the comparison between the main cohort (i.e. 48 cirrhotics hospitalized with covid-19) and 47 cirrhotics hospitalized for acute liver decompensation due to bacterial infection, which served as controls. in the control group, bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 18 (38%) patients, spontaneous bacteraemia in 14 (30%), cholangitis in 5 (11%), urinary tract infection in 4 (9%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 4 (9%) patients, arthritis in one (2%) and gastroenteritis due to clostridioides difficile in one (2%). patients with covid-19 were significantly older, with lower white blood cells counts despite concomitant infection, and lower meld and cpt b/c scores. however, aclf prevalence was similar ( this case series clearly demonstrates the poor outcome of cirrhotic patients (either with compensated or decompensated liver disease) who develop covid-19. the main causes of death were respiratory complications but also the sudden worsening of liver function leading to end-stage liver disease. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the clinical impact of sars-cov-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis.we retrospectively collected data on 50 patients with known cirrhosis and covid-19 managed in nine hospitals in lombardy. interestingly, a health-care related sars-cov-2 infection was registered in 40% of our patients. this fact could be the consequence of their general increased need of hospitalization and assistance due to cirrhosis complications, as well as their increased susceptibility to infections. according to the italian iss report, the nosocomial sars-cov-2 infection rate was 9.9% in italy, which is lower than what we observed in our cohort. moreover, the clinical presentation of sars-cov-2 infection in our cohort of cirrhotics slightly differed from what reported in the general population. indeed, fever was less frequent, 16 whilst an expected increase in cirrhosis complications rate was observed, particularly hepatic encephalopathy. in our study, the 30-days mortality rate was higher in those patients with moderate/severe respiratory failure and in those who had a more deteriorated liver function, as indicated by the increased meld and clif-of scores at covid-19 diagnosis. while the association between severity of lung failure and early mortality was expected, this study is the first to define the predictive role of clif and meld scores in the setting of acute failure of chronic liver disease due to covid-19.the corresponding 30-day mortality rate in non-cirrhotic patients hospitalized following covid-19 diagnosis was significantly lower, with higher median age of deceased patients. unfortunately, no data are available on the role of factors (i.e. co-morbidities, lung failure severity, etc) potentially influencing mortality rates in this control group, as the icd-9 system has been used for data collection. in the same period, 7,600 (16%) of 46,071 patients with sars-cov-2 infection died in lombardy, with a median age of 79 years (73-87). these data significantly differ from what reported in our cirrhotic cohort, characterized by a higher mortality rate and lower age at death.in otherwise stable cirrhotic patients: 25 cpt a patients with low meld score experienced a rapid deterioration in their liver function, so that cpt score increased to b/c after covid-19 diagnosis in more than a third of them. this was even worst for those patients with a decompensated disease before sars-cov-2 infection, since we reported that high meld scores at last visit independently predicted the risk of meld≥15 at covid-19 diagnosis. the short interval between the last outpatient visit (or hospital admission) before sars-cov-2 diagnosis, supports the role of this acute infection in worsening liver function, which is common in cirrhotic patients of any aetiology.the comparative analysis with cirrhotic patients hospitalized for decompensation due to bacterial infections, confirmed that mortality rate due to infections is high, independently of the etiological agent. however, the 30-day mortality for covid-19 cirrhotics was higher than that reported among cirrhotics hospitalized following bacterial infections, although meld score was lower in the former group. multivariate analysis confirmed that covid-19, together with high clif-of, was independently associated with 30-day mortality. this is probably due to several factors, which include the unavailability of effective treatments against sars-cov-2 as well as the impact of lung failure on early mortality even in patients who died because of esld. in fact, also in cirrhotic patients who died for esld, respiratory function had been severely compromised by sars-cov-2, since all of them needed respiratory support.several papers reported the impact of sars-cov-2 infection on transaminases levels in the general population, although they were not specifically focused on the clinical significance of these alterations in terms of both morbidity and mortality, especially in cirrhotic patients. 18 in the setting of chronic liver diseases, persistent and/or severe alteration of transaminases may negatively impact cirrhosis course, also in those patients who had remained stable and free from liver-complications for long time. recently, dong et al reported a 50% alt increase in 202 consecutive patients with confirmed covid-19, which included 38% with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld).interestingly, the authors reported that nafld patients had higher likelihood of abnormal liver function tests from admission to discharge [70% (53/76) vs 11.1% (14/126) p<0.0001]. 18 our study is the first reporting the impact of sars-cov-2 infection on alt levels in patients with cirrhosis, showing that acute liver injury was observed in nearly a half of patients with previously normal transaminases values. moreover, a hepatitis flare was not uncommon at sars-cov-2 diagnosis.however, more data are needed to clarify the impact of alt increase in the natural history of cirrhotic patients with sars-cov-2, and to better explain the pathogenic mechanism of coronavirus in causing liver damage at the level of liver cells. a potential direct cytopathic effect has been suggested, since the abundant ace2 receptors in the liver might favour sars-cov-2 entry into the hepatocytes. 19 otherwise, the liver might be indirectly involved in the severe inflammatory response following sars-cov-2 infection, as it contains a large number of macrophages (kupffer cells) and is a potent cytokine producer. 20 specific treatment against sars-cov-2 was not standardized in our cohort, but rather based upon regional guidelines issued by scientific societies and expert opinions. single physician's decision on every patient was the balance between rapidly available repurposed drugs and acceptable tolerability and safety. most of the patients received hydroxychloroquine, while only one third received lopinavir/ritonavir. with all the caveats of a small sample size, only one major adverse event was reported (qt prolongation leading to drug discontinuation). generally, lopinavir/ritonavir has been used cautiously in patients with more advanced cirrhosis, due to its known hepatic metabolism and its possible detrimental effect on residual hepatic function. at the time of data collection, a phase ii trial with tocilizumab was available only in few referral centers, thus excluding the chance to enrol patients with cirrhosis. in the period before data-lock, access to remdesivir was reserved to mechanically ventilated patients on the basis of a treating physicianinitiated request in a compassionate use program. the two intubated patients of our cohort did not receive remdesivir. the reason for not applying for compassionate use in these two cases are unknown but could be due to the difficult access in programs of experimental drugs in the dramatic hospital emergency we faced in march 2020 in lombardy.interestingly, most patients (80%) in our cohort received thromboprophylaxis, mainly with lmwh, without any evidence of major haemorrhagic complications. the high prevalence of thromboprophylaxis in our cohort might be explained by the established awareness of the increased thrombotic risk in this population, as well as by the ascertained skill in anti-thrombotic management in most centers dealing with cirrhotic patients.we are aware that our study suffers from some limitations, mainly due to the retrospective design of the study. they include the limited number of patients, the short follow-up following the diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection and the low number of patients admitted in icus. however, we believe that this last point might be not only a consequence of the retrospective collection of data but also of the effective limited access to icus of patients with severe comorbidities, such as cirrhotics. in fact, during the study period, we faced with a dramatic scarcity of bed in icus trying to cope with the awesome outbreak of sars-cov-2 infection and covid-19 in italy. another limitation is the imbalance of baseline characteristics (age and meld) between patients with viral and bacterial infection, although multivariate analysis confirmed sars-cov-2 infection as an independent predictor of 30-day mortality. on the other hand, strengths of our study are the involvement of most tertiary referral centers for both infectious and liver diseases in lombardy, thus limiting the risk of underestimating the number of hospitalized cirrhotics within our region.as well as the availability of "historical" information for almost all patients, the inclusion of control groups of well characterized hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and acute decompensation following bacterial infection and without cirrhosis but with covid-19, further strengthens the present study.in conclusion, as the current pandemic of sars-cov-2 is spreading, physicians and hepatologists should be aware of the potential detrimental effects of this infection on the short-term outcome of such a fragile patient population as cirrhotics. clif-of score 7 (4-9) 7 (4-9) 0.92 22% (95%ci 20-38) 1 the world is currently witnessing a dramatic disruption of everyday life owing to the rapid progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic as the pandemic evolves, there is an urgent need to better understand its epidemiology, characterize its potential impact, and identify mitigatory strategies to avert pandemic-related mortality there is a need for a tool or algorithm to evaluate the extent to which public health policy and/or economic preparedness measures are effectively averting covid-19 related mortality we present a simple and yet practical epidemiological tool, the pandemic efficiency index (pei), that can be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from covid-19 infection using the pei and current covid-19-related mortality, we determined that so far germany demonstrates the highest pei (5 1) among countries with more than 5,000 recorded cases of the infection, indicating high quality measures instituted by the country to avert death during the pandemic italy and france currently have the lowest covid-19-related peis epidemics and pandemics come and go, but local, national, and global abilities to determine the efficiency of their efforts in averting deaths is criticalglobal ranking of covid-19-related mortality by country using a novel pandemic efficiency index (pei)towards the end of 2019, a novel respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), was first reported from wuhan, the capital of hubei province in the people's republic of china. this illness has already been assigned the name coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) by the world health organization (who). 1 sars-cov-2 belongs to a family of viruses that cause a variety of symptoms that range in severity from mild cold symptoms to more severe infections, which disproportionately account for a high mortality rate among the elderly and individuals that are immunocompromised. the pandemic has now reached almost every country on the globe (at least 199 countries at the time of writing). the epidemiological variability and lethality of covid-19 in general and specific populations have been reported. 2, 3 the world is currently witnessing substantial disruption of daily lives socially, psychologically and economically as a result of the progression of the covid-19 pandemic.as the pandemic rumbles through nations leaving behind considerable death and damaged economies, no effective treatment seems to be in sight as of now. 4 preventive measures, enveloped in public health advocacy both at the individual and societal levels, and reinforced by national regulations seem to be our best bet of shortening the life span of the pandemic. various countries have instituted diverse policies and laws to protect their citizens as the natural history of the disease progresses. however, just as we witness differences in the degree of public health preparedness across nations, we are also subdued by the lack of simple epidemiological tools that could capture, in broad terms, the comparative effectiveness of measures put in place by different countries to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on human lives. in this paper, we present a simple epidemiological tool that could be utilized globally to test the relative efficiency of measures put in place to avert death resulting from covid-19 infection. for simplicity, we refer to this assessment tool as the pandemic efficiency index or pei. the pei could be used to potentially rank countries and assist in distilling best practices from those countries with optimal outcomes in a pandemic. the higher the pei, the greater the efficiency of the country in protecting its citizens from death resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. using pei, nations can learn and adapt best practices in pandemic control from each other. nations can systematically reverseengineer the practices that countries with higher pei used to achieve lower covid-19-related mortality.we collected information on current details of covid-19 cases across the globe from worldometer. 5 worldometer is an independent company that operates a reference website acknowledged by the american library association as one of the best free online reference sources in the world. the website has been providing live updates on covid-19 related total cases, new cases, deaths, recoveries and critical cases by country, territory or conveyance. worldometer gathers and compiles the information from various sources, including newspapers, government websites, and social media such as twitter, etc. the countries with more than 5,000 cases of coronavirus, as of march 29, 2020 were included in this study and were classified as 'high impact countries.'we calculated the mortality rate by dividing the total deaths by total number of cases associated with the disease, for each high impact territory. as the disease originated in china, we used china's mortality rate as the reference. the formula for covid-19 pandemic efficiency index (pei) for a country x was the global ranking of high-impact countries based on covid -19 pei is illustrated in figure 1 .germany, a country with the fifth largest number of cases (60,659) has so far experienced 482 deaths resulting from covid-19 infection, and had the highest pei (5.09) among the high impact countries. austria with 5,672 cases had the second highest pei of 4.09, followed by canada (3.79) and turkey (2.85). the usa was 6 th on the list, with a pei of 2.28. italy and france were the countries with the lowest pei of 0.4 and 0.3, respectively.covid-19 is the latest global health threat confronting nations, research and medical communities, with national and global efforts applauded and criticized. 6 almost 3 months after the first confirmed case of the virus was identified in china, who declared the disease as a pandemic, making it the first such declaration since the 2009 h1n1 swine flu outbreak. the who had estimated covid-19 mortality rate to be 3.4% about three weeks ago 7 . however, due to the rapid progression of the disease and differential efficiency in disease and mortality prevention across affected countries, the mortality rate had risen to 4.72% as of march 29, 2020. covid-19 has been more deadly than the 2009 h1n1 swine flu pandemic, which registered a case fatality rate of 0.2%. for the first time since the outbreak, wuhan in china reported no new cases on march 19 th 2020, while the usa acquired the status of the country reporting the largest number of new covid-19 infections worldwide. according to various analyses by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), older adults and those with underlying comorbidities like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes are more vulnerable to the severe forms of covid-19 and to die from the disease. 8 from our results, we observed that citizens of countries that performed worse on our pei scale (i.e., had low pei) such as italy, spain, uk etc. had a higher median age than their counterparts from other parts of the world. what was most surprising was the low mortality rate (0.79%) and the highest pei (5.09) of germany, in spite of the fact that it ranks 4 th in the world for the highest median age. 9 austria and portugal were the other two countries with a high pei and median age above 44 years.pei is an innovative tool to compare countries in terms of the impact of their disaster preparedness and management protocols. although covid-19 is a global affliction, different countries have adopted different approaches to confronting the pandemic. pei represents a simple and intuitive epidemiologic tool to compare the efficiency of policies and strategies that various countries have been adopting to curtail the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. lessons learned from these natural experiments would allow us to identify effective measures against mortality from countries with high pei. due to pandemic dynamics with numbers constantly changing, it is possible that the final pei will only be available by the end of the current pandemic.the authors report no conflict of interest. funding/support: none. ethical approval: study used publicly available data and was not subject to irb approval.

pyrimidine nucleoside which was designed as an in vitro broad-spectrum agent, and the first description was published in the journal science. 1 the action on both dna (herpes virus 1 and 2, murine cytomegalovirus, vaccine virus, adenovirus type 3) and rna viruses (rabies-related viruses, virus responsible for myxoma, parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3, influenza a and b, rhinovirus 1a, 13 and 56, coxsackie b, poliovirus type 2, vesicular stomatitis virus and semliki forest virus) were detailed in this work. subsequently, its activity on other viral diseases was determined, and it found its place in clinical practice almost exclusively for the treatment of hepatitis c virus (hcv).in this paper, a review of the references in the pubmed database (up to 31 december 2017) was carried out, crossing (in english) the keyword "ribavirin" with those corresponding to the following viruses or diseases: adenovirus, hantavirus, syncytial respiratory virus, lassa fever, crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever, argentinian haemorrhagic fever and coronavirus. articles written in english and in spanish were reviewed, preferentially selecting the metaanalyses for each disease; in the event that they did not exist, phase i, ii, iii and iv clinical trials were reviewed. finally, if they were not found in the previous searches, a review of the cases or case series 2529-993x/© 2018 elsevier españa, s.l.u. and sociedad española de enfermedades infecciosas y microbiología clínica. all rights reserved. published was performed. in some cases, references to other works were obtained from the articles reviewed.different mechanisms of action have been proposed for this molecule, and the most likely scenario is that it works in different ways in different viruses. 2 the first mechanism that has been suggested is the interference in the de novo synthesis of the guanosine derivatives (in particular guanosine triphosphate [gtp] ). inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase catalyses the formation of xanthine monophosphate from inosine monophosphate to subsequently continue the synthesis pathway of the guanosine derivatives. ribavirin monophosphate is capable of competitively and potently inhibiting this enzyme, reducing the reserves of these nucleotides (or nucleosides) to half in the treated cells. antiviral activity parallel to the depletion of gtp reserves has been demonstrated in studies with the yellow fever virus and paramyxovirus, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (rsv). secondly, an immunomodulatory activity has been suggested, indicating that ribavirin may increase the activity of t lymphocytes, and, in particular, th lymphocytes. this hypothesis was based on the observation that during the treatment with ribavirin in patients infected with hcv, it could reduce cytolysis without modifying the circulating viral load. therefore, it would not have an exclusively antiviral effect. the observation that the l-enantiomer of ribavirin (levovirin) does not present direct antiviral activity, being capable of also producing an induction of the th1 response in the murine model, supported this hypothesis. however, it has not been possible to recognise the immunomodulatory effect in vivo, and, even in mathematical models designed for this, it is concluded that the effect is based on direct antiviral activity. another mechanism that has been proposed is that of direct inhibition of the polymerase. the main intracellular metabolite of ribavirin is ribavirin triphosphate (rtp). in this way, it could be a competitive inhibitor of other similar nitrogenous bases, such as adenosine triphosphate (atp) or gtp. this effect has been observed in studies conducted with the influenza virus, reovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus. some rna viruses contain a structure with 7-methylguanosine, which is essential for the stability of rna and which is synthesised in three different catalytic processes. in other viruses, the translation process is measured by a molecule known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eif4e). the ribavirin molecule could interact with the enzymes responsible for capping (rna cap synthesis) or bind to eif4e, preventing the start of translation. this mechanism could be responsible for the antiviral activity observed in some viruses (lassa fever, sars). lastly, a mechanism of mutagenesis has been proposed. given the structural similarity, the incorporation of ribavirin in the rna chain would be possible and would produce mutant viruses during replication. however, this would not only alter the "original" chain, replacing gtp with rtp, but also the binding to the complementary bases cytidine and thymidine (or uracil) has the same efficacy. this is due to the spatial arrangement and the flexibility in the rotation of a carboxamide group. the mutagenic effect of ribavirin has been demonstrated in studies with poliovirus, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, west nile virus and hantavirus.as we have mentioned previously, the clinical use of ribavirin is almost exclusively limited to the treatment of hcv infection. however, when a review is performed of the indications in the main medicines agencies (spanish agency of medicines and medical devices, european medicines agency and u.s. food and drug administration [fda]), other less well-known approved indications can be found.• the drug virazole, in the form of vials for respiratory inhalation, can be found on the website of the spanish agency of medicines and medical devices. 3 there is no mention of the specific indication, stating that the drug is not currently marketed in spain and that there are supply problems. it was used in aerosols in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection caused by rsv. treatment consisted of nebulisation for 12-18 h for a period of three to seven days. • on the european medicines agency's website, 4 two applications of ribavirin which have been investigated, apart from the indication for hcv, are also found. these are for adenovirus infections and hantavirus infections. in both cases, it was decided to withdraw its consideration in these indications. • finally, the approval of virazole for nebulisation is indicated on the fda's website, 5 although the conditions are not specified.we will now review the clinical evidence of the effectiveness of ribavirin for treating infections caused by rsv, adenovirus and hantavirus.there is a meta-analysis carried out by the cochrane database of systematic reviews 6 in relation to the use of ribavirin in lower respiratory tract infections in children and adolescents, with two subsequent updates and one withdrawn in 2010. the latest review is therefore the one published in 2007. in this review, after analysing 12 clinical trials, the conclusion is reached that ribavirin is not effective at reducing mortality or in the development of respiratory deterioration; however, a reduction in the hospital stay and in the number of days of mechanical ventilation (approximately two days in both cases) is observed.another different aspect of the use of ribavirin in transplant recipients was the treatment of respiratory infections caused by rsv. shah and chemaly 7 carried out a review of the literature regarding the works performed on adult transplant recipients with rsv infection and published between 1980 and 2010. they evaluated 26 studies, both prospective and retrospective (randomised and observational clinical trials), in which the main variable was mortality attributed to rsv or disease progression. the use of ribavirin in any form (aerosolised, oral or intravenous) appeared in these works. the overall conclusion is that the use of ribavirin (whether or not it was associated with immunoglobulins) reduced progression to disease of the lower respiratory tracts and reduced mortality. inhaled ribavirin was useful, but it was especially more effective when associated with immunoglobulin, although its diffusion in the consolidated parenchyma could be reduced. the cost was the main drawback of this therapy (approximately $50,000 per patient).firstly, it must be pointed out that, when the published literature was reviewed (109 articles in pubmed), there were no meta-analyses or clinical trials. the scientific evidence is available from case series and isolated cases. there are seven published case series [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and 21 isolated cases, which accounts in total for published experience on less than 150 cases (tables 1 and 2 ). as can be observed, there is heterogeneity both regarding the virus treated (serotypes) and in the characteristics of the patients (age, gender, risk factors) and in the syndromes produced (pneumonia, cystitis, digestive disease, focal/disseminated disease), disease progression time, combination with other drugs, etc. therefore, a conclusion cannot be obtained and, for this reason, its use has not been approved to date.regarding the use of ribavirin, in diseases caused by hantavirus, there is a meta-analysis published in 2014 by moreli et al. 36 which is worthy of an in-depth review. it is a systematic review in which 518 studies are identified; after applying the exclusion criteria, only seven studies can be analysed, which accounts for a total of 506 patients.two groups (haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome), in addition to two subgroups (studies conducted in animals [4] or in humans [3] ) are distinguished. overall mortality was 35%. in the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome group, a randomised study and three prospective cohorts were identified. in the animal studies, a reduction in mortality was observed in the treatment group versus placebo, but not in the studies in humans, with a mortality rate in both groups of 40%. in the haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome group, three studies were included. a reduction in mortality was observed when ribavirin was used compared to placebo (2.5% versus 8.5% mortality) with a relative risk (rr) of 0.56 (0.42-0.76) in both the animal and human subgroups.with the existing data in this meta-analysis, it could be suggested that old world hantavirus infections (haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome) could benefit from the use of ribavirin, whereas it would not be useful in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. the authors state that they have not been able to consider the time from diagnosis to the administration of ribavirin: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has a mortality rate of 50% and may indicate a more rapid progression of the disease than in haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which has a mortality rate of 15%. this would be a key factor, indicating the greater need to start therapy at an early stage.another bias may have been the restriction of works selected according to language: only works published in english, spanish or portuguese were selected. given that china has the most cases of hantavirus with haemorrhagic fever (in the period from 1950 to 2007, a total of 1,557,622 cases of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were reported, with a clear tendency to reduce the incidence), it is possible that a priori information published in chinese has been eliminated which would modify the results obtained.lastly, it must be taken into account that the list of hantaviruses is extensive (23, including the hantaan, seoul, puumala and dobrava viruses for haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and the sin nombre and andes viruses in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome). the heterogeneity between viruses (not only between syndromes) may determine the results. this is what may be indicated by a recent study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ribavirin in the treatment of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by the puumala virus, which does not benefit from the use of ribavirin. 37 it was an open, randomised study, on 73 patients, of whom 36 received standard support therapy and 37 the same therapy in addition to intravenous ribavirin. the study was not able to demonstrate efficacy in clinical aspects or in viral kinetics in the treatment, with important side effects (mainly anaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, sinus bradycardia and skin rash).when a review is performed of the treatment of lassa fever with ribavirin, 108 publications are obtained. however, when the clinical trials and meta-analyses are evaluated, only one reference in relation to the effectiveness of the treatment is found. 38 it is a study conducted in sierra leone in 1986 by the ministry of health in collaboration with the centers for disease control and prevention he also had other comorbidities, such as splenectomy and pancreatectomy, and mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection. c death due to colon adenocarcinoma. cases of disease due to mers-cov treated with interferon and ribavirin. regimen a. 2000 mg as loading dose, 600 mg/8

loading dose 2000 mg and then 1200 mg/8 h orally.(cdc), which started in 1977, and in which the administration of convalescent plasma, oral ribavirin and intravenous ribavirin was evaluated. the study is rather complex. however, despite this fact, it can be concluded that treatment with intravenous or oral ribavirin is recommended at any time of the disease (with it being more effective in the first six days of the disease). initially, a phase i casecontrol study of the clinical and diagnostic aspects of lassa fever in untreated patients was designed (30 clinical and laboratory variables were collected which were analysed subsequently), and, once these variables were collected, a randomised trial was conducted with 70 patients (39 with oral ribavirin and 31 with plasma; pregnant women were included without being randomised in the latter group), without knowing at this time the results of the analysis of the variables collected. in all cases, treatment was started in the first 24 h. subsequently, elevation of transaminases and viraemia greater than 1000 copies/ml were identified as poor prognosis variables.at a later stage, after the variables indicating poor prognosis had been determined, a phase ii study was developed, selecting the patients with one of the poor prognosis variables (elevation of transaminases upon diagnosis; viraemia was not available). two groups of patients (29 patients in the intravenous ribavirin group and 33 in the intravenous ribavirin plus plasma group) were randomised. pregnant women received only two plasma units. overall, treatment with ribavirin reduced mortality. this included the analysis of the patients included both in the phase i study and in the phase ii study. in patients with viraemia >1000 copies/ml and treated with ribavirin, mortality was lower than in those who were not receiving treatment (mortality with intravenous ribavirin of 32% versus 76% without therapy (p = 0.00015); mortality with oral ribavirin of 30% versus 76% without therapy (p = 0.008). the same occurred if the viraemia was <1000 copies/ml (mortality with intravenous ribavirin of 9% versus 28% without therapy (p = 0.02); mortality with oral ribavirin of 7% versus 28% without therapy (p = 0.01).there is a second study, conducted by fisher-hoch et al., 39 which appears in pubmed as a clinical trial regarding the use of ribavirin in lassa fever. although it is true that it refers to its use in a clinical trial, what it describes is the onset of an adverse effect which is associated with recovery ("shivering/chills") and what seems to be related to the speed of administration of the drug (<1 min). these side effects disappeared after correcting the speed of infusion. some studies have been conducted to evaluate ribavirin as post-exposure prophylaxis, but they have not provided conclusive results. 40, 41 crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever there is only one randomised clinical trial which evaluates the use of ribavirin for crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever, conducted between 2004 and 2007 with 136 patients. 42 in a baseline form, there were no differences in gender, age, incubation period (around five days), clinical or analytical characteristics. the administration of ribavirin was done before confirming the diagnosis, meaning that the time to administration of it was around four days. no differences were found in terms of mortality, analytical recovery or length of hospital stay. subsequently, two meta-analyses evaluated the usefulness of ribavirin for crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever. the first is from 2010 43 and reviews 21 works. the conclusion that the authors draw is that ribavirin in the clinical trial was not superior to not using ribavirin, but in the joint evaluation of all the results, mortality was reduced (rr: 0.56; 95% ci: 0.35-0.90; 955 participants). what was not found was a difference in duration of the hospital admission. the second meta-analysis is from 2011, 44 and also includes the only randomised clinical trial, but only seven more works, which are observational with control group, are introduced. no benefit of ribavirin with the aggregated data is found either. both meta-analyses underline the risk of bias in all the works, whether it be selection, external validity or attrition bias.ribavirin has not managed to demonstrate its usefulness in the reduction of mortality due to the junin virus (argentine haemorrhagic fever) in two very small clinical trials. 45, 46 nevertheless, in the first study, blocked viral replication and a delay in the time to death was observed, compared with historical controls. clearance of viraemia was even obtained in patients who died (in this phase of the disease the virus is detected in up to 80% of cases). given that there is a treatment which has proven to be effective if administered in the first seven days of the disease (convalescent serum), studies which used ribavirin were conducted in advanced stages of the disease, which would justify the poor outcomes. it is probably not possible to conduct new studies in this regard, since there is also a vaccine which has proven to be effective at reducing the incidence of the disease. 47 there are practically no reported cases of the machupo virus treated with ribavirin (bolivian haemorrhagic fever): only two isolated cases in which intravenous ribavirin was administered and they recovered. 48 the same applies to cases of sabia virus. in 1995, one case of sabia virus was treated with intravenous ribavirin, managing to cure the patient. 49 one retrospective study was conducted in 44 patients with coronavirus 50 to compare the combination of interferon and ribavirin versus placebo, observing an improvement in survival at 14 (70% vs 29%) and 28 days (30% vs 17%) in favour of the combination table 4 case series of disease due to mers-cov treated with ribavirin (+ ifn). of drugs, although the difference at 28 days was not statistically significant (probably due to the small sample size). the mean treatment initiation time with ribavirin was three days. in addition, isolated cases 51-55 and case series, 56-60 which reflect variable degrees of therapeutic success (tables 3 and 4) , have been reported.new applications of ribavirin are currently being investigated. four studies to investigate its usefulness in influenza, three on arbovirus, three on hepatitis b, three on hantavirus, two on paramyxovirus, two on coxsackie virus and one on coronavirus are registered.ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral that is currently looking for a new role in the treatment of various infections. its availability for administration via the oral, intravenous or inhaled route is a beneficial characteristic. there is evidence of benefit in rsv infection and lassa fever, with its use being proposed in certain situations of disease due to hantavirus, crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever and coronavirus, such as middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). the availability of ribavirin in oral formulation currently exists in spain, while the inhaled and intravenous forms must be requested through the spanish agency of medicines and medical devices.in early december 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease in wuhan city and the rapidly spread throughout china has put the world on alert.high-throughput sequencing has revealed a novel β -coronavirus that is currently named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) 1 , which resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) 2 . most patients with covid-19 were mild. moderate patients often experienced dyspnea after one week. severe patients progressed rapidly to critical conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), acute respiratory failure, coagulopathy, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis.early identification of risk factors for critical conditions is urgently warranted not only to identify the defining clinical and epidemiological characteristics with greater precision, but also facilitated appropriate supportive care and promptly access to the intensive care unit (icu) if necessary.the chinese health authority has announced that the total number of confirmed cases on the chinese mainland has reached 76,936, and 2,442 people have died of the disease as of feb 23. among the 2,442 deceased patients, most were old and two-thirds were males, though the detailed data has not been reported 3 . this raises a question: are men more susceptible to getting and dying from covid-19?here, we reported the clinical characteristics of a recent case series of 43 patients with 2019 sars-cov-2 infection we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of sars-cov-2 in wuhan city and the 1019 survived patients with sars-cov-2 from six cities with a high prevalence of the disease. we aimed to compare the severity and mortality in male and female patients with covid-19, to explore the most useful prognostic factor for individualized assessment. sars-cov-2 infection is . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license it is

series analysis, a recent case series of 43 patients with covid-19 was treated at wuhan union hospital by the medical team of beijing tongren hospital from january 29, 2020 to february 15, 2020. respiratory specimens were collected by local center for disease control and prevention (cdc) and then shipped to designated authoritative laboratories to detect sars-cov-2. the presence of sars-cov-2 in respiratory specimens was detected by real-time rt-pcr methods. the rt-pcr assay was conducted in accordance with the protocol established by the world health organization.in the public data set, the first 37 cases died of covid-19 in wuhan city and the 1019 survived patients with covid-19 from six cities with a high prevalence of the disease were obtained from the chinese public health science data center. case data included basic demographic information, classification, date of symptom onset, date of diagnosis, date of hospitalization, date of discharge or date of death, etc. the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of beijing tongren hospital, capital medical university.data were expressed as mean ± sd, median (interquartile range (iqr)) or percentage, as appropriate. compared the differences between the two groups, mean values and percentages were compared between the two groups by the student t-test, mann-whitney u test or chi-square (χ 2 ) test. kaplan-meier survival curves and the log-rank test was used for testing the survival between males and females. statistical analyses were performed using the sas software (version 9.4). p< 0.05

hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and chronic lung diseases. the mean duration from self-reported symptom to death was 15 (iqr: 10-19) days. table 2 summarizes the clinical and biochemical characteristics of all sars patients. the median age of the deceased patients was much higher than that of the survived patients (57 vs. 32, p<0.001). the rate of the concomitant diseases in the deceased patients was also higher than that of the survived patients (57.0% vs. 17.9%, p<0.001).while the deceased patients were significantly older than the survived patients ( figure   3a ), ages were comparable between men and women in both deceased and survived patients with sars ( figure 3b ). the proportion of males was higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (χ 2 test, p=0.016) ( figure 3c ). survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% ci] 1.47 [1.05-2.06], p= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women ( figure 3d ).coronavirus is a

(n=102) patients treated in the icu (n=36) were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years) 11 . consistent with previous reports, older patients (≥65 years old), were more likely to have a severe type of covid-19 in the case series patients in the present study. in the public data set, we also found that the percentage of older age (≥65 years) was much higher in the deceased patient than in the survived patients (83.8% in 37 deceased patients vs. 13.2% in 1019 survived patients). the results indicated that older age was associated with a high mortality in patients withthis is the first preliminary study investigating the gender role in morbidity and mortality of sars-cov-2 infection. it is suggested that covid-19 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as ards 10 . among the 425 patients with covid-19, 56%were male, indicating males may be more susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection than females 6 . in 140 hospitalized patients with covid-19, an approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female patients was found 10 . in four case series reports, 30 of 41(73%), 67 of 99 (68%), 25 of 51(49%)

cities and in a case series of 43 hospitalized patient (51.2% males).although the deceased patients were significantly older than the survived patients with covid-19 in this study, ages were comparable between males and females in both the deceased and the survived patients. consistent with this predominance, we also found that the proportion of male was higher in the deceased group than

mortality rate than women in sars patients. therefore, gender is a risk factor for higher severity and mortality in patients with both covid-19 and sars independent of age and susceptibility.in early 2003, we participated in the beijing municipal medical taskforce of sars 12 . here, we re-analyzed the data of a large population of 520 sars patients including 135 deaths in beijing, and summarized the experience and lessons for present use, because sars-cov-2 and sars-cov attack cells via the same receptor, ace2 3 . we have previously reported that high protein expression of ace2 receptor in specific organs correlated with specific organ failures indicated by corresponding clinical parameters in sars patients 12,13 . interestingly, the ace2 gene is located on the x-chromosome and it has been shown that circulating ace2 levels are higher in men than in women and in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular diseases 14 .therefore, male patients may be more prone to die from sars-cov-2 because of the high expression of ace2, though further research on the mechanism is needed.this study has some limitations. first, for severity analysis only a case series of 43 patients with sars-cov-2 were included, because detailed patient information, particularly regarding clinical outcomes was unavailable in the public data set;second, for mortality analysis only the first 37cases died of sars-cov-2 in wuhan city were included. however, this is the first preliminary data investigating the gender role in morbidity and mortality in patients with sars-cov-2. more clinical and basic research regarding gender and other prognostic factors for individualized assessment and treatment is needed in the future.in conclusion, older age is a predominant risk factor for severity and

difference in total population among different counties, we calculated the covid-19 infection rate as the number of covid-19 cases divided by the total population in each county. to investigate the

0.079). to examine the impact of health and demographic factors on the mortality rate of covid-19 in us counties, a multivariable linear mixed effects model was performed.as shown in table 2 our results showed that while the number of days since the first reported case in each county was positively correlated with the infection rate of covid-19, it was negatively correlated with the mortality rate of covid-19. in addition, the infection rate was significantly negatively correlated with the mortality rate of covid-19. one possible explanation could be that health professionals or medical system developed more efficient medical practices (such as increase icu beds and enhance social distancing) to treat covid-19 patients, so that the mortality rate was decreasing even though the infection rate was increasing with the spreading of covid-19 over time.in this study, we showed that the population density was positively correlated with both the infection and mortality rates of covid-19 even though the estimated coefficients were small.with the higher population density, social distancing might be more challenging, which could contribute to higher infection and mortality rates of covid-19. is the author/funder, who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.the copyright holder for this preprint this version posted may 11, 2020 13 . here, we showed, at the population level, percentage of smokers in us counties was negative correlated with the infection rate of covid-19. however, several studies showed that smoking could worsen the health outcomes of covid-19 patients 14, 15 . while it requires further investigation on how smoking affects the infection and mortality of covid-19, careful caution should be taken to interpret these results and smoking should be discouraged.in this study, we showed that percentage of population with 65 and over was positively correlated with the mortality rate of covid-19 at the population level. one study on covid-19 patients from china and other countries showed that the older age group (above 60 years) had significantly higher death rate than the younger age group (below 60 years) 16 . the centers for disease control and prevention reported that 8 out of 10 deaths in the us related to have been in adults with age 65 and over. one possible reason for high death rate in elder patients is that the majority of elder patients with covid-19 have comorbidities, such as respiratory diseases, kidney failure and heart conditions, which might contribute to the fatal . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0

avoid covid-19 infection due to their high fatality rate.it has been shown that there was no association between influenza vaccination and coronavirus 17 . however, one study showed that influenza vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus 18 . here, we showed that percentage of people with vaccination was negatively correlated with the mortality rate of covid-19. considering the difference between influenza viruses and coronaviruses, the influenza vaccines are less likely to prevent infections with coronavirus. in this study, we did not observe the significant correlation between influenza vaccination and the infection rate of covid-19. however, without influenza vaccination, the covid-19 patients might have more severe symptoms with the influenza infection, which might lead to higher fatality rate. whether influenza vaccines could lead to low mortality rate of covid-19 requires further investigation.our statistical model showed that percentage of rural was positively correlated with the mortality rate of covid-19. moreover, the counties that are farm-dependent or mining-dependent have high mortality rate of covid-19. one possible explanation could be that the medical systems in rural areas are not well equipped and prepared for the covid-19 infection. this finding should be alarming since rural areas have limited medical resources to respond to this pandemic and treat covid-19 patients 19 . additional measures (such as professional health experts and wellequipped hospitals) should be taken before the covid-19 becomes epidemic in rural areas.in our study, the number of confirmed covid-19 cases and deaths were from 1point3acres.com, which is subject to some errors (such as unreported cases). in addition, we only examined the correlation of health and demographic factors with the infection and mortality rates of covid-19 at the population level. therefore, the causal relationship could not be . cc-by-nc-nd 4.0

[1] also reported data from 1,099 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients from 552 hospitals of 30 chinese provinces through january 2020. a total of 41.9% were women and those with severe disease were older (by a median of 7 years) than those without severe disease. the presence of any coexisting illness was also more common among those with severe disease as opposed to those with non-severe disease (38.7% vs. 21.0%).a systematic review by rozenberg et al. [4] suggested a higher mortality risk in men than in women. the authors also reviewed different factors associated with covid-19-related fatalities. the zhu et al. [5] meta-analysis summarizes the most relevant aspects of the new disease among chinese people, and reported that males accounted for 53.3% of all deaths.during the past months, there have been several reports highlighting the fact that mortality is higher in men than in women in england, wales and germany [6] . hence, the objective of the present study was to examine if the mortality risk by gender in europe is different from or similar to that in china.a pubmed search strategy was performed using the following terms (covid-19 or sars) and (europe) and (mortality) and (gender) that yielded 7 publications. however, there was no information regarding the specific topic in terms of comparing fatalities by gender in different european countries. in addition, the pre-print medrxiv [7] and biorxiv [8] repository servers of scientific research were searched on may 2, 2020. a search was also performed on j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f google on may 20, 2020, using the same strategy, rendering a list of 7,020,000 items and sites with relevant information. the first 15 items reported the most consulted information on the matter and were more targeted on the issue of mortality gender differences in patients with covid-19 [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . this procedure has been previously validated to obtain relevant medical information through google [24] . the remaining web links, up to the initial 200 top google references, did not report different specific information regarding covid-19 mortality by gender in european countries.the only source of information about mortality related to covid-19 by gender in european countries was the global health 50/50 repository [9] . we extracted public information accumulated up to may 23, 2020 from this data repository related to mortality by country and gender. global health 50/50 is a nonprofit organization that highlights gender health inequalities and is currently studying along with the cable news network [25] the influence of gender on the evolution of covid-19. for the present analysis we extracted information reported online by country [9] and up to may 23, 2020, from the corresponding national authorities.results were eligible if information on mortality and number of cases was separately reported by gender in european countries. two researchers independently evaluated study eligibility, and discrepancies during the study selection process were discussed and resolved through author consensus.the primary outcome was mortality due to covid-19 affecting men and women, separately reported by gender. other outcomes were not available. definitions for case inclusion were based on national standards at the time of each country report. extracted data included country, the total number of covid-19 cases and the total number of related deaths, both indicators by gender, and as reported by the corresponding national authorities. if some of these variables were not available for extraction, the country was excluded. meta-analyzed countries are presented in figure 1 .random-effect models with the inverse variance method were used for meta-analyses.effects were reported as risk ratios (rrs) for cases of mortality by country and gender divided by covid-19 infected cases by gender with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (cis). a p value of < 0.1 for the chi 2 test was used to define heterogeneity; a tau 2 value of > 1 was defined as the presence of substantial statistical heterogeneity. an i 2 value of 0-30% was defined as low heterogeneity, 30-60% moderate heterogeneity, and > 60% substantial heterogeneity [25] . to explore reasons for heterogeneity we predefined subgroup analyses by excluding countries reporting fewer than 5,000 or fewer than 10,000 cases. publication bias was not assessed since there was one single source of information, although we included more than 10 countries. statistical analyses were conducted using review manager (revman 5.3;cochrane collaboration, oxford, uk).twenty-three countries reported extractable data with the required predefined information, giving a total of 484,919 men and 605,229 women positive for covid-19. the meta-analysis by gender indicates that men have a significantly higher risk of covid-19related death than women (rr = 1.60, 95% ci 1.53, 1.68; i 2 = 92%; tau 2 = 0.01; df = 22, p < 0.001) (figure 1) . the gender mortality trend was similar when countries with fewer than 5,000 cases (rr = 1.60, ci 1.52; 1.69, 478,500 women and 597,908 men; i 2 = 93%) or fewer than 10,000 cases were excluded (rr = 1.68; ci 1.62, 1.76; i 2 = 89%; 383,367 women and 495,327 men). since there is only one source of information, there was a high risk of bias. sensitivity analyses were performed by omitting each country, one by one, in order to evaluate the stability of the results, and the i 2 was still > 65%.the present analysis of the information from the global health 50/50 demonstrates that men are more vulnerable to covid-19 than women in terms of mortality, and the effect persists even when countries reporting fewer cases are excluded for analysis. our results suggest that the mortality risk is significantly higher for men than women, and more so than is suggested by results from china [26] . this finding seems to apply regardless of individual baseline health characteristics, and social, economic, and healthcare systems. indeed, although the studied endpoint was the same (covid-19 deaths) for all analyzed countries, the sample is heterogeneous in terms of local clinical facilities, political orientations, and structure of healthcare organizations. for instance, some european countries did not recommend j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f confinement measures (e.g. sweden), while others applied confinement ('lockdown') too late (e.g. spain) [27] .although there is no exact information, it seems that the impact of the covid-19 crisis was focused in some countries, and in general, on the most vulnerable segments of the population: elders, those with co-morbid conditions, and those living in residentials for the elderly. perhaps younger individuals were prioritized for access to the intensive care units. this information is not currently available, and will require appropriate and detailed analysis in order to identify any health disparities, especially in relation to populations who have and have not paid for healthcare cover. despite all these limitations, our meta-analysis suggests that there are causes inherent to gender that determine a higher mortality rate in males than females.differences have been observed among several asiatic countries in terms of covid-19 prevalence and related mortality [28] . this situation suggests (i) social and healthcare differences, (ii) heterogeneity of outcomes, including prevalence and mortality, and (iii) other factors related to social organizations and political interventions [28] . in europe, healthcare policies and social recommendations applied by corresponding national authorities have also been diverse or heterogeneous. in this sense, one can mention the application of confinement measures (e.g. some applied early, while others applied later or too late, or never applied them) [27] .current research shows that a poor prognosis with covid-19 is related to factors such as gender (male), age (>60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), and secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), among others [4, 29] . one narrative review underlined differences related to gender, diagnosis, prognosis and mortality rates among covid-19 patients [30] but the results were not mathematically analyzed. in this sense, we meta-analyzed and found a significant gender difference in covid-19 related deaths among europeans.there are several limitations related to the available data on mortality associated with the covid-19 pandemic. at the present time, there is no scientific reports that compare the mortality rate by gender in european countries. results are reported in a heterogeneous manner in different european countries and the analyzed data from global health 50/50 include this limitation. the current total number of covid-19-related deaths is likely to be higher than the number of confirmed deaths. we suggest different reasons for this: (i) under-recording is most likely a result of limited testing capacity and problems in the attribution of the cause of death; j o u r n a l p r e -p r o o f (ii) recorded covid-19-related in death registries may differ between countries (e.g. some may only count hospital deaths, whilst other have started to include deaths at home or deaths in residential settings for the elderly; (iii) some countries delay reporting covid-19--related deaths, hence data are not always up to date; and (iv) the available information by gender does not include age, which may be a confounding factor in the current meta-analysis. despite the aforementioned limitations, to the best of our knowledge, the global health 50/50 is the only current source of european information reporting by gender.despite the mentioned limitations, our analysis has strengths. indeed, it was based on a potential covid-19-related outcome that requires reporting (death in relation to the number of cases stratified by gender in european countries that supposedly have the obligation to report health outcomes to supranational organisations).the current analysis allows the conclusion to be drawn that men living in europe have a significantly higher risk of covid-19-related death. however, more detailed information is urgently needed to examine the factors involved in covid-19 mortality, including age, basal health status, co-morbidity, and lifestyle. in this sense, unfortunately the european centre for disease prevention and control [31] , which is the agency in charge of information at supranational level, does not report the aforementioned covid-19-related information. there is an urgent need for this situation to be improved.in conclusion, during the last months, the mortality rate related to the covid-19 pandemic was significantly higher in european males than in european females, but the causes or mechanisms and circumstances of this difference were not identifiable with the available evidence. supranational health authorities should design appropriate strategies to overcome the lack of accurate information.faustino r. pérez-lópez conceived, designed, supervised, and drafted the article, extracted data from the global health 50/50 repository and calculated outcomes of interest. mauricio tajada contributed to the searches on pubmed, google, and preprint repositories. ricardo savirón-cornudella contributed to the searches on pubmed, google, and preprint repositories.
