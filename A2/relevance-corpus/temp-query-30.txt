provisionalmente al coronavirus causante como sarscov<NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> el sarscov<NUMBER> es un nuevo virus que pertenece la subfamilia orthocoronavirinae género coronavirus al subgénero sarbecovirus betacoronavirus beta<NUMBER>b dentro de ellos al clado linaje <NUMBER> que está mucho más próximo genéticamente los coronavirus de los murciélagos que del sars humano el genoma del sarscov<NUMBER> está formado por un arn de una sola cadena de unos <NUMBER> nucleótidos seis orf open reading frames idénticos al resto de coronavirus varios genes adicionales la mayoría de estos genes sólo presentan una homología del <NUMBER> con el antiguo virus sarscov sin embargo los genes implicados en la replicación orf<NUMBER>ab presentan una homología del <NUMBER> con este virus <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> pesar de ello la secuenciación completa de los genomas de los coronavirus detectados en pacientes especialmente el gen de la arnpolimerasa arndirigida rprd el gen espícula externa muestran que las resumen el <NUMBER> de diciembre de <NUMBER> se detectó en la ciudad de wuhan china un brote neumonía causado por un nuevo coronavirus sarscov<NUMBER> debido la elevada capacidad de difusión e infección humana se ha convertido en una nueva pandemia zoónotica la ausencia de una vacuna ha determinado la búsqueda de fármacos antivirales con capacidad para inhibir la replicación del nuevo virus de entre ellos remdesivir un análogo de la adenosina es el que parece tener un futuro más prometedor este fármaco ha mostrado vitro en animales una elevada capacidad para bloquear la infección replicación viral con unas concentraciones alcanzables en el plasma humano aunque todos los estudios se han realizado con el sarscov el merscov parece que por analogía virológica funcional remdesivir es de los pocos antivirales con demostrada eficacia sin embargo se precisan estudios ensayos clínicos en humanos para conocer el resultado de su aplicación en los mismos este fármaco por sí mismo en combinación con ritonavir ha mostrado actividad anticoronavirus vitro frente al sars los pacientes tratados con esta combinación frente al grupo tratado con ribavirina presentaron un menor riesgo de desarrollar distress respiratorio fallecimiento <NUMBER> <NUMBER> otro grupo de antivirales de posible utilidad serían los análogos de los diferentes nucleósidos que han mostrado capacidad para bloquear la actividad replicativa de diferentes virus tanto adn como arn <NUMBER> sin embargo en el grupo de los coronavirus existe una dificultad biológica frente estos compuestos que es la síntesis de una <NUMBER>´<NUMBER>´exoribonucleasa exonn que interactúa con ellos e inhibe su actividad <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> gracias este enzima compuestos como el <NUMBER>fluorouracilo la ribavirina carecen de eficacia vitro por evasión de su capacidad para interferir en la síntesis del nuevo arn viral <NUMBER> <NUMBER> sheahan et al <NUMBER> fueron los primeros en <NUMBER> en comunicar que el profármaco monofosforamidato un análogo del nucleósido cadenosina <NUMBER>´ciano<NUMBER>aza<NUMBER>dideazaadenosine gs<NUMBER> gs<NUMBER> posteriormente designado como remdesivir presentaba capacidad para inhibir la infección replicación del sarscov merscov de algunas cepas de los batcov en cultivos de células epiteliales del tracto respiratorio humano <NUMBER> <NUMBER> además remdesivir presentaba eficacia terapéutica profiláctica frente al sarscov en el modelo murino <NUMBER> <NUMBER> remdesivir en su forma de trifosfato es un análogo de la adenosina figura <NUMBER> que compite preferentemente por el atp viral se incorpora como falso nucleósido la nueva cadena del arn viral determinando una terminación interrupción prematura primeras <NUMBER> horas postinfección de la síntesis del arn de la replicación viral por ello también se le considera un inhibidor de la arnpolimerasa viral arndirigida rprd <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> gordon et al <NUMBER> han demostrado vitro que remdesivir interactúa de forma directa con las proteínas nsp<NUMBER> nsp<NUMBER> de la rprd del merscov siendo esa su diana terapéutica además confirman que los nucleósidos externos aportados en este caso en forma de remdesivir se incorporan mucho más eficientemente al proceso replicativo viral que los existentes en el propio citoplasma de la célula infectada <NUMBER> el estudio de wang et al <NUMBER> ha mostrado que la concentración efectiva<NUMBER> ce <NUMBER> de este antiviral frente al sarscov<NUMBER> en cultivo de células veroe<NUMBER> es de <NUMBER> µm sugiriendo que esta misma concentración podría alcanzarse en el ser humano sin dificultad también han comprobado como remdesivir inhibe eficientemente la infección por el sarscov<NUMBER> en cultivos celulares células huh<NUMBER> procedentes de cáncer hepático humano <NUMBER> <NUMBER> remdesivir ha demostrado vitro capacidad para inhibir la replicación de un betacoronavirus animal mouse hepatitis virus interfiriendo con la rprd pesar de la presencia de la exoribonucleasa <NUMBER> este enzima viral nsp<NUMBER> exonn se encargaría de escindir el antiviral determinar la disminución de la sensibilidad resistencia al mismo <NUMBER> <NUMBER> destaca además que los coronavirus parcialmente resistentes este antiviral obtenidos vitro tras <NUMBER> pases en presencia del gs<NUMBER> cepas humanas constituyen un linaje distinto del sarscov pero muy cercano al linaje detectado en algunos murciélagos batcov ratg<NUMBER> <NUMBER> el sarscov<NUMBER> ha infectado en estos momentos muchas más personas que sus predecesores <NUMBER> varios factores parecen haber favorecido esta rápida expansión por una parte que el epicentro del brote la ciudad de wuhan presenta unos <NUMBER> millones de habitantes es el principal nudo de comunicaciones de la provincia de hubei lo cual facilita los contactos personapersona la exportación de casos otras ciudades los datos estimados de su ro están en <NUMBER> de modo que cada paciente puede infectar <NUMBER> ó <NUMBER> personas nuevas este valor es parecido al sars ro <NUMBER> mucho mayor que el del mers ro <NUMBER> pero el número de personas infectadas por nuevo coronavirus por trasmisión interhumana es unas <NUMBER> veces superior que los virus previos <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> la ausencia de un fármaco antiviral de demostrada eficacia frente los diferentes coronavirus obliga utilizar diferentes estrategias para optimizar aquellos ya conocidos la primera de ellas sería probar utilizando los ensayos clásicos los antivirales de amplio espectro conocidos que se utilizan para otras infecciones víricas estos métodos establecen el efecto de este fármaco en las diferentes fases de replicación viral formación de placas en los cultivos celulares como ejemplos de este tipo de fármacos serían los diferentes interferones tipo ifnalfa beta kappa etc… tipo ii ifngamma estos fármacos poseen la ventaja de conocerse de antemano todas sus propiedades farmacocinéticas farmacodinámicas sus posibles efectos adversos sin embargo ninguno de ellos ha demostrado eficacia ni efecto cuando se administran en solitario sobre los diferentes coronavirus estudiados además de provocar ciertas reacciones adversas en algunos pacientes <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> la segunda metodología sería la de utilizar la librería múltiple de compuestos químicos que se conocen probar algunos de ellos de acuerdo con su fórmula química la búsqueda del azar funcional parece evidente que este sistema que ha funcionado para otras patologías sería demasiado útil para obtener un fármaco anticoronavirus sintético eficaz en un breve espacio de tiempo <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> la tercera posibilidad sería el desarrollo de fármacos específicos basados en el conocimiento análisis del genoma del ciclo replicativo de los diferentes coronavirus <NUMBER> <NUMBER> hasta la fecha se han probado muchos compuestos químicos capaces de bloquear vitro esta actividad en los coronavirus sin embargo la mayoría de ellos son eficaces clínicamente por comportar situaciones de inmunosupresión del huésped porque su dosis efectiva es muy superior la obtenida nivel plasmático <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> frente al sarscov<NUMBER> de acuerdo con las primeras guías terapéuticas chinas los únicos compuestos inicialmente recomendados serían el ifnalfa <NUMBER> millones unidades la combinación lopinavirritonavir <NUMBER> mg<NUMBER> mg <NUMBER> el ifnalfa es un antiviral de amplio espectro que se ha utilizado para el tratamiento de la hepatitis b por su parte lopinavir es un inhibidor de la proteasa que se emplea para el tratamiento el vih pecialmente el personal sanitario como terapia en esta entidad debería administrarse lo antes posible primeras <NUMBER> horas ya que la replicación viral es máxima al inicio de la sintomatología con ello se acortaría el tiempo de excreción del mismo su transmisibilidad por ello este antiviral podría tener utilidad terapéutica en los pacientes infectados por el sarscov<NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> sin embargo en estos momentos los pocos datos de eficacia actividad antiviral se han realizado sólo frente al sarscov merscov por ello todavía se desconoce la eficacia seguridad de remdesivir en pacientes infectados por el sarscov<NUMBER> sin embargo según los datos obtenidos hasta el momento remdesivir podría ser la esperanza antiviral frente al sarscov<NUMBER> que se expande pandémicamente por el planeta los autores declaran que existe conflicto de intereses análogo de remdesivir desarrollan dos mutaciones temporales f<NUMBER>l v<NUMBER>l en el gen de la rdrp pero permanecen sensibles concentraciones elevadas del mismo mientras que se observa una disminución evidente del fitness de su trasmisibilidad en comparación con la cepa salvaje del merscov <NUMBER> este descenso del fitness se debe fundamentalmente la alteración en la replicación del genoma viral escasa fidelidad de copia de la rprd errores en la incorporación de los nucleótidos la nueva cadena viral baja estabilidad de las proteínas derivadas de estos genomas <NUMBER> <NUMBER> estos datos indican que para la obtención de la máxima actividad antiviral los análogos de los nucleósidos incluido remdesivir precisan inhibir de forma directa la expresión del gen exonn exoribonucleasa lo cual les permite obtener concentraciones intracelulares más elevadas <NUMBER> pesar de todo ello parece evidente la elevada capacidad de remdesivir para inhibir de forma directa eficiente la replicación del arn de la inmensa mayoría de coronavirus incluyendo muy probablemente el nuevo sarscov<NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> <NUMBER> los estudios experimentales en animales demuestran que comparado con el grupo control este antiviral reduce de forma significativa la replicación la carga viral disminuye el daño pulmonar esta actividad es mejor que la obtenida con la utilización de lopinavirritonavir
